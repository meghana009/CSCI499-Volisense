sufficient tiny homes inspired by the prairie style cottages that dot the wintery landscape there as well as by american architect frank lloyd wright s renowned appreciation of nature those who simply want to purchase an escape tiny home is looking at a cost ranging from 40 000 to 80 000 plus any utilities and the cost of a license plate since these tiny homes on wheels are legally designated as recreational vehicles however the rental program that offers free tiny vacation homes is rather elegant as well here s how it works the partner deemed well suited to receive an escape tiny home undergoes a credit check and drops a security deposit of up to 2 000 escape will deliver its free rentals to any location within 100 miles of the top 50 metropolitan areas in the u s delivery and setup costs will be deducted from future rental fees the partner is also responsible for maintaining the unit including housekeeping as well as carrying adequate liability insurance the partner must also set up utilities including water and septic but the escape tiny homes designed by sala architects are surprisingly robust and adaptable in addition to solar power the units can be outfitted with water or gas tanks as well as composting or dry flush toilets and even a washer dryer upon request heat can come from a variety of sources including baseboard heat a furnace split system or a

november 2018 compared to the n402 26bn withdrawn in the same period of 2017 latest data obtained from the nigerian stock exchange on monday showed that foreign inflows into the market fell to n553 48bn in the nine month period from n598 82bn in 2017 foreign portfolio investment outflow includes sales transactions or liquidation of portfolio investments through the stock market while the fpi inflow includes purchase transactions on the nse equities only according to the data the volatility in capital flows especially foreign portfolio investments has been described as one of the downside risks to the nation s macroeconomic outlook at their meeting in november several members of the monetary policy committee of the central bank of nigeria expressed concerns over the continuous outflow of portfolio investments dr robert asogwa noted that capital inflows had declined consistently especially since 2018 while outflows had increased thus making external financing more challenging in the country he said there have been sharp declines in inflows especially for portfolio investments and foreign direct investment between july and september 2018 foreign portfolio investors withdrew more than n94 4bn from the nigerian stock market alone he noted that the movements had been attributed to the monetary policy normalisation process in some advanced economies which had seen interest rates in places like the united states increased for three times in 2018 besides the usual investors fear about the 2019 general elections may have also been a contributing factor given that monetary policy forecasts for 2019 in many advanced economies suggest policy rate increases the capital flow position in nigeria may possibly worsen in the near future asogwa added another member prof dahiru balami said there was a threat to exchange rate stability due to the pressure on external reserves as well as an increase in capital outflow it should be noted that capital outflows are accelerated due to lack of instruments for foreigners to invest in price stability is better achieved if we can prevent exchange rate volatility through proper management of external reserves he added the acting director general securities and exchange commission mary uduk said in a recent interview that the sec was doing a lot to boost investors confidence in the nation s capital market she said a large percentage of those who do business in our market are foreign investors and as of the third quarter of 2018 the capital outflow stood at n513bn as against n477 7bn incoming we can see that the impact of an increase in interest rate in advanced countries not just in the us has an impact on capital outflow thereby leading to reduced performance in our markets i want to say that the interest rate

last eight quarterly reports are the pessimistic market makers onto something or would this be a good time to pick up cypress stock at a discount let s find out the business since merging with memory chip maker spansion in 2015 cypress has delivered sprightly growth on both the top and bottom lines starting from the first quarter of 2016 in an effort to avoid direct merger based boosts cypress has seen its sales rise by 36 while free cash flows skyrocketed from basically breakeven to 462 million a year cypress delivers connectivity storage and microcontroller solutions to several vibrant end markets including a respectable foothold in the automotive computing sector in particular management expects connectivity sales to grow by double digit percentages for the next four years or so we re talking low power wi fi and bluetooth chips for the internet of things and automotive markets alongside a market leading position as a provider of usb c controllers so the company is working in several promising growth markets and has some strong financial performance to show for it the stock value investors might catch a glimpse of cypress astronomical price to earnings ratio and back away slowly the stock is trading at 97 times trailing non gaap earnings which is a deal breaker for many value chasers at the same time you can buy cypress shares at bargain bin valuation ratios such as 10 7 times ebitda profits or 10 times free cash flows these ratios have been plunging downward all year long as the stock stuttered while cash profits were on the rise the key to this split screen picture of cypress lies in the company s actual chip manufacturing assets using a hybrid manufacturing strategy that reminds me of texas instruments cypress handles about 65 of its manufacturing needs by placing orders with third party chip foundries but tackles the remaining 35 of its chipmaking business through a network of in house manufacturing facilities chipmaking equipment is expensive stuff which leads to some creative accounting tricks the big up front cash costs of manufacturing gear are written off against earnings over many years in the form of depreciation and amortization charges cypress reported 53 6 million of gaap net income over the last four quarters but these bottom line results included 281 million of depreciation and amortization charges this technique allows cypress to pay taxes based on lower gaap profits while pocketing larger actual cash profits the upshot cypress is a steal these days cypress is doing just fine as a business with healthy cash profits and an eye toward sustained long term growth share prices are falling for all the wrong reasons more closely connected to pessimism about the chip sector as a whole than to anything cypress is doing the international trade wars will have to end at some point and so will the flagging interest in the latest and greatest smartphones meanwhile 5g wireless networking and self driving cars will push this company s most important target markets for many years to come you can pick up this stock at very reasonable prices except in terms of basic p e ratios as explained above and the falling share price has also driven cypress dividend yield all the way up to 3 5 what s not to love',\n"," '',\n"," 'efe rancagua a city near santiago has become chile s first digitalized city on the threshold of the

her path to the nomination won t be easy but the massachusetts democrat s unique brand on policy gives her a chance to influence the field like no other candidate warren who announced on monday that she s considering a bid for the white house passed on a run in 2016 and faces significant obstacles this time around there s more competition early 2020 polling finds her surprisingly weak in her home state despite handily winning re election in november and she drew criticism on the left this year over her rollout of a dna test to corroborate family stories of native american heritage with no obvious front runner warren still has an opening but she s also a rare figure in that like bernie sanders in 2016 she has the potential to exert a strong influence on her party and the primary even if she falls short with a boost from sanders much of the early democratic contest has been focused on ramping up government spending to combat inequality with competing proposals from top tier contenders to implement medicare for all free college a green new deal trillions of dollars in new tax benefits and a guaranteed jobs program warren has a chance to differentiate herself by shifting the conversation toward how to restrain government and business under a strict new set of rules how did we get here she asked in her announcement video on monday billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice over the last year warren has been padding her core message with major legislation that s likely to form the backbone of a presidential campaign if some of her ideas stick with voters rivals could risk a grassroots backlash if they fail to keep up in august warren unveiled a far reaching government ethics package that seemed to touch on just about every corruption scandal in the last few years headlined by a lifetime ban on lobbying by top elected and appointed officials the anti corruption and public integrity act also would ban foreign lobbying stock trading by members of congress and require politicians from the president down to release eight years of tax returns the house version is notably co sponsored by the influential co chair of the progressive caucus rep pramila jayapal d wash it s not hard to imagine some of warren s ideas becoming a baseline demand on the left in a fractured field that can be very hard to resist trump s ethics issues played only a bit part in midterm campaigns but ongoing investigations by federal prosecutors and the incoming democratic house are likely to keep them in the spotlight depending on what they find it could potentially intensify voters focus on the corruption issue ahead of the primaries warren s ethics platform also gives her a chance to potentially police individual behavior by rivals donors are already testing whether they can get away with backing candidates via an allied super pac that can take unlimited donations warren s rivals may feel greater pressure to renounce outside support knowing she s there to wave her bill and raise it in a televised debate also in august warren unveiled the accountable capitalism act a bill that would require large corporations to allow workers to elect 40 percent of their board make it harder for companies to engage in political activity and tack on new legal responsibilities toward customers and employees while she s hardly alone in the potential field in targeting big business her legislation and longtime emphasis on consumer advocacy could leave democratic rivals vulnerable if they aren t careful in a race that could feature multiple billionaires including former new york city mayor michael bloomberg the senator is well positioned to start fights and draw contrasts over corporate influence whether or not voters name her as their top choice her reputation within the party makes them more likely to listen to her critiques there may be limits to her approach though the economy was an unusually weak factor in the midterms for one with unemployment low and consumer confidence high voters listed economic issues well behind health care as their top concern in exit polls similar to ethics issues it s possible the next year could shift the conversation in her favor though the stock market is looking wobbly and some analysts are raising concerns about a broader slowdown ahead if there s even a minor downturn the senator might be well positioned to make her case and her rivals more likely to incorporate it into their own message whether or not warren ends up on a democratic ticket in 2020 don t be surprised if the eventual nominee ends up sounding a lot like her',\n"," 'as government shutdown drags on so do economic worries',\n"," 'oh snap looks like something

licence to the end of march more here in just a few days we ll know if auckland streets will be flooded with more e scooters or whether they ll disappear lime s street trading licence will expire on january 14 the end of a three month trial councillors and licensing staff will discuss lime when they return from their christmas and new year break on january 7 a spokeswoman says a decision on the next steps will be taken that week she says mayor phil goff ordered a probe after councillor christine fletcher was nearly knocked off her feet by a lime rider outside the town hall on october 25 and 150 acc claims were racked up in a month councillors and staff were waiting on the final version of that report the spokeswoman said the results of at s lime survey will also be digested lime riders in auckland photo chris keall several people will be involved and consulted whether it goes to a council vote will not be known until everyone meets in the new year the spokeswoman said she said the council is watching events in queensland where the gold coast council took a hard line against lime confiscating e scooters and forcing the company to suspend operations for failing to follow licensing rules lime riders in christchurch photo christchurch city council lime s trial licence in christchurch expires at the end of february the council is currently asking for feedback through its website 10km speed limit there are three possible outcomes for lime the worst case scenario would be that it had its licence pulled the best case would be an extension of its trial or a permanent licence but it s also possible its licence would be extended but with conditions for example following the tumultuous council meeting after the fletcher near miss a 10km per hour speed limit was mooted a lime can hit a top speed of 27km h on the flat though there have been reports of up to 40km h hit downhill i think there has to be a speed limit and we are looking at the initial idea of a speed limit of around 10km h but we will listen to public feedback on that goff said helmets not legally required and currently only seen in lime publicity shots could also be on the agenda the mayor said what happened to onzo and wave lime launched in new zealand in october putting 1000 scooters into auckland and 700 into christchurch it has since launched in upper and lower hutt local contender onzo which already has e bikes in auckland was due to launch up to 2500 e scooters in the city on november 6 while australia s wave scooters had a november 30 nz launch slated neither could be immediately reached for comment auckland council understands both are now waiting on the result of lime s trial before committing to the city uber waiting in the wings uber which along with google has been bankrolling the san francisco based lime will also be watching closely the company sees a move to multi modal transport as the answer to inner city congestion from e scooters to e bikes and even walkers uber s injection of hundreds of millions into lime and its purchase of e bike operator jump show it s serious about its multi modal strategy which one of the company s nz staff says will be a major point of focus for 2019 simple common sense should prevail but i suspect it won t lime is not accountable in auckland or contactable and its own rules are ignored by riders so why should lime a

electrification scheme was completed to deliver light and power to homes in clondulane near fermoy many parts of cork had electricity before the establishment of esb in 1927 the esb s annual reports record 20 local electricity suppliers in the county that means 20 individuals or companies who had permits to commercially supply electricity to 3 or more homes and businesses in their local area clondulane area was one of 92 designated rural areas in county cork rural electrification started there in august 1954 finished in april 1955 with a total of 1 135 poles used over a line amounting to 105 kilometres in all 125 premises were connected sean lemass td minister for commerce opened the debate in seanad eireann on march 7 1945 exactly two months before world war ii ended the following were his prophetic words 1 of 3 i hope to see the day when a girl will enquire about the number of electrical appliances in the home rather than the number of cows he is milking or the number of churns of milk going to the creamery when she receives a proposal of marriage from a farmer lemass confirmed the job of the magnitude of the rural electrification scheme had never been undertaken it would require in excess of one million wooden poles and involve the use of 75 000 miles of new line compared to 2 000 miles of existing line the erection of 100 000 additional distribution transformers compared to 1 200 existing ones and the connection of 250 000 existing urban customers in those bygone days of an almost forgotten era the simple fact was people were surviving quite happily by using other sources of energy they could have easily continued using candlesticks and oil lamps rather than electric light and power open hearth turf fires and ranges rather than electric heaters cheap wash boards and woman muscle power rather than electric washing machines domestic refrigerators were deemed as outrageous luxuries and best confined to hollywood films in 1948 49 the mould of traditional rural life was broken by the introduction of rural electrification it was met with the usual resistance in rural communities throughout ireland the principal objection was the cost factor the ground rent element of the cost stirred up deep rooted historical memories of the detested landlords rack rent people did not want another rent around their necks many households felt it was a luxury they could not afford it was a daunting change in lifestyle for old age pensioners with no other source of income they were in their twilight years and they were being asked to part with the soft homely glow of the oil lamp and the flickering candle with their meagre pensions they could not afford the cost of electric appliances during their lifetime the open turf fire in the hearth provided them with warmth was never allowed to go out now they were advised to replace it with an electric fire small farmers with uncertain incomes saw no merit in signing up to connect to a network to provide electric light and power the route to rural electrification in rural parishes throughout ireland was a thorny one for those with responsibility for its delivery the debate on the merits of electric light and power raged at street corners at church gates after mass in creamery queues and in public houses local clergy joined in the debate as part of the parochial duties they did much to remove the unreasonable uncertainty and irrational fears which permeated the debate the work of construction couldn t begin the latter half of 1946 this was a consequence of post world war ii shortages and the difficulty of sourcing supplies of suitable wooden poles in advance of commencing such a monumental task the newly created electricity supply board esb had divided the country into 792 areas each served by an engineer an organiser a clerk and a supervisor the first two were crucial to selling the scheme to households and had to ensure home owners kept their promise after they had signed up to be connected as each area was canvassed the line crews moved in to survey and peg the routes for the main lines the day of reckoning had arrived home owners were faced of identifying a contractor to wire their homes or of opting out of connection to the scheme the majority opted to sign the contract agreement digging holes for the electricity poles was a major task in the days before the emergence of the jcb digger they were dug by pick and shovel and men had very different experiences the recruitment of local men to supplement the esb crew was welcomed by the local community the members of esb crews experienced traditional rural hospitality of home owners into fermoy and clondulane at the end of a hard day s work esb men and locals joined together in jovial conviviality in the local public houses the younger members of esb attended dances in local halls and danced with local girls whom they had met in the course of their work men diggings holes could get an trouble free job if the soil was sandy or soft rock caused a lot of problems for them the hole was quite wide and was six feet deep to get down that depth with a pick and shovel a hole had to measure seven feet long four feet wide at one end and tapering to a narrower width at the other end there was a shelf at about four feet down and this reduced the amount of soil to be dug in the lower section the poles were pulled by a horse to individual holes teams of men slowly placed the pole in the hole and ensured it was perpendicular in a carefully coordinated effort the poles were imported mainly from finland the initial cost was 2 per pole a total of 114 000 were shipped in 1947 and in all 1 000 000 arrived in the following years they were shipped between may and september into dublin cork and limerick ports cresotting plants were established to treat them before poles were distributed to individual areas the term backsliders was used to describe persons that had signed up for connection in the initial canvass and later changed their minds many were the victim of an overzealous canvass by a local person of influence who had persuaded reluctant home owners to sign up in order to increase the numbers and improve the chances of getting electricity to their area at an earlier date refusals resulted from learning of the cost of wiring the house premises and amount of the ground rent obviously the rural electrification scheme had to be paid for esb achieved this through a two part electricity tariff system in addition to a government subsidy one element was the fixed charge this was known as ground rent it was based on the floor area of the house and out buildings it was used to pay for the connection of the supply and appeared an unreasonable imposition to many consumers customers the second part was a unit charge for electricity actually used the physical work of rural electrification was almost done the poles were up the line was laid and more and more premises in the area were being connected every day but the success of the scheme depended on more than just the switch on of the lights the following is an apocryphal story which did the rounds in the early 1950s it illustrates the conservative attitude of many users and potential users towards the new power source an elderly woman had her house wired but insisted there was to be no sockets in the walls because she could not afford any of these new fangled appliances she also insisted that there was to be only one light socket in her house and that this socket was to hold the lowest wattage bulb available because she had visions of ending up in prison through not being able to pay the bill after some months the meter reader called and he was very puzzled by the meter reading which was almost nil you don t make much use of the electric light mam he commented politely oh faith and then i do sir replied the old woman in the evening times always i switch it on while i am searching for the candle it was essential that the new customers should not only be shown how to make the best use of the new power but should be actively encouraged to do so with this in mind esb undertook a widespread programme of education demonstration and promotion it focussed on the benefits of electricity both at home and on the farm in the homes of rural ireland the change from the soft glow of an oil lamp to the much harsher light of the electric bulb was a big one low watt bulbs were often preferred to minimise both the contrast with the familiar oil lamp and the perceived high cost of electricity it is difficult nowadays for people to understand why anyone would refuse an essential household commodity like electricity by 1976 420 000 households representing 98 99 of all rural houses had been connected to the rural electrification scheme at a total cost of 80 million the state subsidy amounted to 28 million images courtesy of esb archives at www esbarchives ie',\n"," 'photo

the type of mortgage that buyers choose and the possibility of paying off the loan early are all factors to consider when buying a property writes john lowe i don t think it would be an overstatement to say that property and in particular owning it was something of a national obsession it is easy to understand why home ownership offers security and the potential to make a capital gain indeed in the 10 years up to 2006 residential property prices had grown at an average rate of 12 per annum sadly the downturn took hold but there are still opportunities in the property market especially now for those with money and income only the fortunate few can afford to buy a home outright for the rest of us saving up until we had the full cost of the apartment or house we wanted to buy would be impractical leaving aside the fact that it would probably take decades we would need to live somewhere else in the meantime the solution is to take out a mortgage or home loan such loans are secured against the value of the property being purchased and because this means the lender faces much less risk they are normally the least expensive type of borrowing you can undertake from a financial perspective mortgages are the most important consideration when buying a property they are not however the only thing you need to think about if you own or are thinking of owning a property just as important are issues such as whether it is better to rent or buy investing in property property related costs tax and a host of other related topics all subjects that are covered extensively in what follows taking advantage of the mortgage revolution please put any pre conceptions you have about buying a home or arranging a mortgage to one side the truth is your home is not necessarily your most important investment your home is definitely not your most expensive purchase you don t have to take 25 years plus to pay back your mortgage also and this is crucial to keeping the cost of buying your home or investment property to a bare minimum the interest rate your mortgage lender charges you makes a huge difference to the cost of buying your home the type of mortgage you have also makes a huge difference to the cost of buying your home changes in the mortgage market have meant that for the foreseeable future you may be tied to the lender from whom you originally got your mortgage for this reason it is essential that you do careful research before selecting a particular lender or product independent advice from an authorised adviser will stand you in good stead over the whole term of your mortgage not necessarily your most important investment definitely not your most expensive purchase received wisdom has it that the most important investment most of us will probably ever make is in our home there is no doubt that owning your home is a significant part of being financially secure the cost is not dissimilar to renting a home making it a good financial decision you aren t at the mercy of unscrupulous unpleasant greedy or inefficient landlords with luck you ll see the value of your property rise in the longer term giving you a tax free gain nevertheless although it makes sense to buy your own home you shouldn t be fooled into thinking that it is the be all and end all of investments it is arguable in fact that building up your other investments especially a pension plan is substantially more important furthermore the stock market has traditionally always produced a better return than property i m not trying to put you off buying your own home far from it but don t forget it is only one part of establishing your personal wealth it is also worth remembering that your home won t automatically be your most expensive purchase depending on interest rates that honour could easily go to your mortgage if you buy a house for 200 000 and take out a traditional repayment mortgage for 160 000 80 of the purchase price and pay it back over 25 years at an average rate of 6 the total cost of buying your home including interest will be 309 265 09 that s 109 265 09 more than the actual cost of your home which is why it is crucial you choose the least expensive mortgage option available to you interest all the difference in the world the rate of interest you are charged on your mortgage makes a huge difference to the total cost of your home as the table opposite indicates the difference between paying say 3 5 and 4 5 which doesn t sound like much actually equates to 18 336 of interest over the 25 year term and increases repayments by 161 12 per month put another way think how much extra you would have to earn after tax to end up with 18 336 in your pocket paying more mortgage interest than you have to can seriously damage your wealth shopping around makes excellent sense although there is a whole range of mortgages to choose from they all fall into one of two categories repayment annuity mortgages interest only mortgages the first option is a repayment or annuity mortgage with this type of mortgage your monthly repayments are divided into two parts the first is the interest you owe on the total amount borrowed the second is repayment of part of the capital you have borrowed the big advantage of this mortgage is that you are guaranteed to have paid off your whole loan at the end of the term however in the early years almost all your monthly repayments will be in interest let me give you an example sheila takes out a 300 000 mortgage over 25 years at an interest rate of 3 7 her monthly capital and interest payments are 1 542 39 at the end of the first year she will have paid a total of 18 508 but will still owe over 296 200 to her lender in year 10 she will have paid 185 086 and will still owe 212 000 put another way in the first 10 years roughly 60 of what she pays to her lender will be interest and only 40 will be capital the other sort of mortgage on offer is an interest only mortgage with this type of mortgage you pay only the interest for the agreed period with investment mortgages you pay interest only on the amount borrowed and at the same time you would set up a savings plan which it would be hoped will pay off the capital at the end of the term your monthly repayments will therefore consist of interest on the loan and a contribution to a savings plan this is ideal for certain types of loans eg commercial loans where the interest remains constant and the tax relief can be maximised because the capital is not being repaid you are receiving the most tax relief on the interest in the first year right through to the end of the term in the case of both a home and an investment property there are certain circumstances where you might not bother with the savings element as i ll explain around 30 years ago interest only home loans got a bad name because many borrowers were advised to take out endowment policies to repay the capital at the end of the term unfortunately some of these policies failed to produce a sufficient return to do so in other words borrowers found that after 25 years they still owed money to their lenders despite past problems with endowment mortgages interest only home loans can make sound financial sense for instance if you are self employed the tax benefits of a pension linked interest only mortgage can be very substantial in particular when taken out for commercial property here is a summary of the three main types of interest only mortgage options available endowment mortgages there are various types of endowment policy available these are investments offered by life insurance companies the money you pay to the life insurance company is partly used to provide you with life cover so that if you die the mortgage itself can be repaid and partly invested in the stock market if the money is invested well then obviously your original loan will be repaid and you might even be left with a tax free sum however if the performance of the endowment policy is not good then you could be left with insufficient cash to repay your original loan there is no tax relief on endowment policy premiums in fact this type of mortgage has not been available for many years there are various types of endowment policy available these are investments offered by life insurance companies the money you pay to the life insurance company is partly used to provide you with life cover so that if you die the mortgage itself can be repaid and partly invested in the stock market if the money is invested well then obviously your original loan will be repaid and you might even be left with a tax free sum however if the performance of the endowment policy is not good then you could be left with insufficient cash to repay your original loan there is no tax relief on endowment policy premiums in fact this type of mortgage has not been available for many years pension linked mortgages the difference between this and an endowment mortgage is that the life insurance company after taking out money to pay for life cover invests your cash into a pension fund this has very definite tax benefits for anyone who is self employed or on an extremely high income ordinarily the pension fund is designed to mature on your retirement age at double the original amount being borrowed twenty five percent of this pension fund is available at maturity for encashment tax free and even though you will have to pay tax on the rest of the fund you should have sufficient money to pay off the rest of the mortgage new rules on self direct trusts or ssaps small self administered pension schemes now allow pension funds to borrow on properties indeed there are all sorts of other tax benefits available to those who buy property as part of their pension fund some of this is covered elsewhere in the chapters on retirement planning and tax however as it is such a complicated area you will need to take specialist advice consultation moneydoctor ie if you wish to take advantage of the rules the difference between this and an endowment mortgage is that the life insurance company after taking out money to pay for life cover invests your cash into a

such a complicated area you will need to take specialist advice consultation moneydoctor ie if you wish to take advantage of the rules interest only mortgages it was possible to borrow money to purchase property at very competitive rates of interest without any obligation to repay the capital before the end of the term for instance if you took out a 20 year interest only mortgage all you have to pay each month is the agreed rate of interest the capital sum isn t due until 20 years have passed this could suit you for all sorts of reasons perhaps you are expecting to receive a lump sum such as an inheritance before the 20 years are up maybe you intend to re sell the property during this period possibly you have other investments that could be cashed in to repay the loan possibly you will win the lotto do note that you will have to take out level term life cover that covers the entire amount borrowed for the full term in association with an interest only mortgage so that the loan can be repaid in the event of your death interest only mortgages are now a thing of the past fixed or variable rate as if you didn t have enough choice already another decision you must make when mortgage shopping can be whether to opt for a fixed or variable rate a fixed rate means that the amount of interest you pay is pre set for an agreed period of time this offers you the benefit of certainty even if interest rates rise your repayments will stay the same on the other hand if interest rates fall you won t benefit you incur a penalty should you wish to pay off or part pay off your mortgage while on a fixed rate of interest generally this sum is set at between three and six months interest on the amount being repaid a variable rate on the other hand will move with the market this is fine while interest rates are low but if they begin to rise you could be adversely affected there is generally no penalty if you wish to pay off all or part of the loan before the end of the mortgage term tracker mortgages were the real deal and today are costing ireland s lenders a fortune to maintain the interest rate tracked the ecb rate currently 0 00 and the lender agreed a margin or profit that had to be maintained for the entire term of the mortgage only if the ecb rate moves does your tracker rate move today there are some lucky mortgagers paying 0 5 over the ecb rate total 0 5 as they would have negotiated their loan based on only having to borrow less than 50 of the value of their home something i have become very keen on in recent years is the idea of overpaying your mortgage each month this can t be done with all mortgages for instance you can t do it where you are on a fixed rate but where it is possible and your income allows it brings real benefits with interest rates low at the moment and potentially likely to stay low for the next few years it may be also important to remember that if your return yield is far greater than the cost of the money the mortgage rate then investing your surplus monies elsewhere may be more beneficial consider these two examples though where overpayment can also be beneficial mary takes out a repayment mortgage for 250 000 with a term of 25 years at 5 5 her minimum monthly repayment is 1 535 22 however she decides that she can afford to pay an extra 235 a month as a result her mortgage will be paid off six years earlier and she will save 57 070 in interest john also takes out a repayment mortgage for 320 000 with a term of 30 years at 5 75 his minimum monthly repayment is 1 867 43 he overpays by 320 a month and as a result his mortgage will be paid off nine years earlier and he will save 120 429 31 in interest buying or renting the key factors to consider should i buy or rent ireland is one of the few countries in europe where buying one s home is the norm broadly speaking at present the cost of buying a home is the same as or in many cases less than renting the same property this is linked to supply and demand of course and varies from region to region as well as from property to property we were in a low interest environment until 2006 and this favoured house purchase as did the availability of mortgage interest relief interest rates rose between 2006 and 2008 and while they are now back to historically low levels consumers are more reluctant to borrow and the relatively meagre tax relief for first time borrowers has not been available to first time buyers since december 2012 and the existing relief will finish in january 2024 if a future government were to introduce greater tenant rights the situation may change but at the moment if you can raise the deposit buying makes better long term sense after all when you give up a rental property you receive nothing back whereas when you have paid off your mortgage you will own your home and may have seen a nice tax free capital gain as well house prices in ireland rose at an unprecedented rate in the 10 years to 2007 and most informed opinion then was that as long as we continued in a low interest environment and our economy remained healthy a sharp fall in house prices seemed unlikely however things have changed dramatically over the last 11 years and prices are down 35 40 from the 2006 peak how much can i borrow you should always put down as much of a deposit as possible when buying your home if you are a first time buyer you will need a minimum of 10 of the purchase price that is to say 30 000 if you are buying a 300 000 property but it is preferable to have more why because it makes you less vulnerable to moves in interest rates and property values your ability to repay a mortgage will be based on your net disposable income ndi gross income less tax usc prsi and any existing loan repayments and will be stress tested to allow for future interest rate rises the maximum percentage of your ndi that can be set aside for financial commitments including a home loan depends on your income and can be as much as 42 you will also have to demonstrate that on your existing expenditure pattern you have the ability to meet the stress tested repayments on the proposed new mortgage this can come from a combination of existing mortgage repayments or rent a regular savings plan and repayments from other existing loans which will be fully paid before the mortgage is drawn down what is apr the initials apr stand for annual percentage rate and it is the way in which the cost of your loan is expressed what makes it different from a straight interest rate is that it takes into account not just the interest rate but also the timing of any interest payments capital repayments and other charges arrangement fees and so forth the apr must by law reflect the actual rate of interest charged over the full period of the loan is it worth switching my mortgage to get a lower rate the short answer is it depends if you can find a new lender willing to allow you to switch if the loan to value of your mortgage is less than 60 there are two things to consider apart from proof of ability to repay how much can you save by switching lender what is switching lender going to cost you the first question is easy to answer the second question will depend on a variety of factors including whether you are on a fixed interest rate in which case there may be a penalty for switching how much it is going to cost you by way of legal and other costs if you can save 0 25 a year interest or more it could well be worth the switch if in doubt consult an authorised mortgage intermediary or accountant and ask them to do the figures for you what if i m self employed most financial institutions are pleased to lend to someone who is self employed though if you have less than three years sets of accounts it may be harder this is another instance where a professional authorised mortgage intermediary will help he or she will know which lenders are keen for your business and willing to offer you the lowest rates remember that it is the net profit after expenses but before tax that lenders use for borrowing eligibility note it is no longer possible to get a mortgage in ireland without a statement from your accountant to the effect that your tax affairs are completely up to date what will it cost for me to buy a home there are various expenses in buying a home valuation fees no lender will let you have a mortgage without a proper valuation the price of this will vary but is likely to be in the region of 130 you may like to ask an architect or some other type of professional property adviser to survey the building for you to check its condition and the likely cost of repairs the fee for this will be linked to the amount of work required and could run to several hundred euros or more for a large house legal fees this is primarily the cost of employing a solicitor to look after the whole transaction for you the normal cost is in the region of 1 of the total price plus vat at 23 and outlay so for a 200 000 house you will have to find in the region of 2 400 your lender may also charge you a certain amount to cover their legal fees if it is a commercial transaction negotiation over legal fees is possible and you should ask for a reduction especially if you are a first time buyer land registry fees on a 200 000 property these would be up to 750 the fee is to cover registering the property in your name stamp duty this is based on the purchase price of the property the following rates of stamp duty apply to all residential properties 1 on residential properties up the value of 1m and 2 on excess over 1m commercial stamp duty on non residential property is duty rates charged at 6 search fees this is to check that the property has planning permission isn t located on the site of a proposed development and so forth usually around 150 arrangement fees some lenders charge application and arrangement fees these could amount to between 100 and 300 but generally only apply to non home loans to give you a typical example for a first time buyer purchasing a house for 200 000 with a 90 mortgage 180 000 the total fees will be of the order of 4 000 is it worth repaying my mortgage early should you overpay your mortgage each month should you use all your available cash to reduce your mortgage should you use a lump sum of cash to reduce or pay off your mortgage the answer is probably yes if the following applies to you you don t have any other more expensive debts if you do these should be paid off first it won t leave you without some savings tucked away against a rainy day there aren t other investment opportunities that might be worth more to you in cash terms if you were thinking of paying off some or all of your mortgage i would strongly advise consulting an authorised adviser or mortgage intermediary first he or she will be able to work out the figures for you what different types of home insurance will i need in summary homeowners should take out the following cover buildings insurance this will be compulsory if you have a mortgage basically it means that if some damage is done to the fabric of your home by a fire or flood for instance then money is available to repair or rebuild as necessary contents insurance this protects you against loss of or damage to your home contents mortgage repayment insurance payment protection insurance this cover is optional but means that if you are ill or made redundant your mortgage repayments would be paid for you payments usually last for up to a year refunds are underway from some of the providers who mis sold this product if i have trouble making my mortgage repayments what should i do contact your lender immediately the worst thing you can do is keep them in the dark about any financial problems you may be encountering if you need help with your finances you could contact a qualified experienced financial adviser your local st vincent de paul

from new investors on our official facebook page most of them want to know which is the best mutual fund scheme for a new investor well many mutual fund advisors believe investors should choose a scheme or schemes based on their investment goals horizon and risk profile for example if they are investing for a short term goal they should opt for a debt mutual fund schemes that match their horizon and risk profile similarly if they are investing for a long term goal they can invest in an equity scheme based on their horizon and risk profile to explain a conservative investor looking to park money for a few weeks can settle for an ultra short term scheme if the person wants to invest in a year or two she can opt for a short term debt scheme with a low risk profile similarly the person can invest in a largecap scheme if she is investing to achieve a long term goal now is there a special scheme that is ideal for first time investors well many advisors believe that tax saving mutual fund schemes or elss funds could be an ideal way for a first time investor to step into the world of equity mutual fund schemes these help investors to save taxes of up to rs 1 5 lakh under section 80c of the income tax act they come with a mandatory lock in period of three years which many advisors say would help investors to get used to the volatility typically associated with equity mutual fund schemes advisors point out that many elss investors have graduated to other equity mutual fund schemes over the years some mutual fund advisors believe that new investors should start with aggressive hybrid schemes these schemes invest in a mix of equity at least 65 per cent and debt because of the mixed portfolio they are relatively less volatile during a bad phase in the market the debt part of the portfolio cushions impact of volatility in the portfolio some mutual fund advisors are of the view that investors should opt for largecap schemes as they are the least volatile among equity schemes they reason that since these schemes invest 80 per cent of the corpus in top 100 stocks by market capitalisation they would help investors to grow their investment without too much volatility after the recategorization exercise by sebi a small group of advisors are of the view that multicap schemes are ideal for new investors to get into the market as per the new norms the fund manager of multicap schemes have the freedom to choose his investments based on his view of the market this would help these schemes to shift between marektcaps and sectors easily other equity schemes would find it very difficult to do this as they are mandated to invest in a certain fashion after the recategorization of schemes finally what should new investors do well we believe that once they have made up their mind to achieve their long term financial goals by investing in equity mutual fund schemes investors should ideally choose a scheme based on their risk profile also they should

endangered species according to its website the center which started offering public tours in 2007 receives funding from educational programming partnerships with businesses donations and occasional grants it said stinner told cnn affiliate wncn the center first started doing rescue and sanctuary work but moved away from that emphasis and began working with more species trying to involve the community more we like to think of ourselves as kind of a community zoo she said who regulates the center animal rights groups criticized the center calling for more oversight in a statement brittany peet director of captive animal law enforcement for the peta foundation called on lawmakers to make it illegal for nonaccredited facilities to possess wild and exotic animals humans and captive animals will keep losing their lives as long as unaccredited roadside zoos like the so called conservators center keep imprisoning dangerous animals for entertainment peet said the center is regulated by the us department of agriculture according to stinner no problems were identified during routine inspections in january 2017 and april 2018 according to usda records the center on its website said it is not accredited by the association of zoos aquariums which accredits facilities but it works with facilities worldwide to help manage a few of the thousands of species not included in the association of zoos aquariums breeding program the center said it considers its work complementary to the association until we choose to apply for any accreditation we will continue to meet and often exceed the standards put in place by the usda for all facilities open to the public that house exotics regardless of accreditation the website said alexandra black courtesy virginia black what kind of animals are housed there the center houses more than 20 species of exotic animals including about 20 big cats lions leopards and tigers the 2018 usda inspector counted 16 lions out of 85 animals where

14 year old lion was born at the facility shortly after his mother was placed at the center as the result of a government assisted confiscation in 2007 the center said matthai could usually be found sunning or lounging in a hammock the center said in his bio which is no longer on the website he is a little nervous by nature so he relies on cues from his bolder neighbors like willow and calvin when deciding how to react to new experiences like a person playing acoustic guitar nearby or if there is a loud noise nearby the bio said matthai was killed by first responders by necessity officials

employment in state institutions even though they have technically reached the retirement age according to the auditor general mr daniel yao domelevo his office has already obtained the database on some suspects and they will be going after them in 2019 he said the database on the suspects have been obtained from social security and national insurance trust ssnit the driver and vehicular licensing authority dvla where the suspects procured some services and left copies of their real dates of birth there the exercise according to mr domelevo would also ensure that workers in the employment of the state particularly in subvented institutions entered with the correct qualifications and certificates and were doing the right jobs according to their qualifications this according to him was to help clean the payroll system and enable the audit service to properly document the database gathered from various government agencies early next year we are going to start with the subvented agencies such as ghana broadcasting corporation the universities all the subvented institutions the police the army we are going to all of them to be sure that if you were recruited as a policeman did you bring the right certificates and that is what you are doing mr domelevo said in an interview with radio ghana he added they forget when they got employment they reduced their age they ve forgotten that they have a social security number and there is an age they gave they have forgotten that they went for driving license and they gave another age there so we have collected all these database which tells us so we already have the suspects we know some people we already suspect them because the database we have tell us that they have lied severally he added mr domelevo added so at the end we are going to ask you tell us which of these dates are the correct ones anybody who joined the payroll wrongly we think its a problem let me say something which i think is very disturbing its when people have gotten fake certificates to be in professional positions like in hospitals he said somebody is operating in a hospital and his certificate is fake i hope you also know the effect of someone teaching as a professional teacher meanwhile he doesn t have the certificate so these are some of the things we have to do so to clean the payroll the auditor general said the names of such culprits would not just be taken out its not just deletion it is coming with a certificate of disallowance and then surcharge and i want to plead with ghanaians if that happens don t come to my office because the constitution does not give me authority to revoke my certificates under clause 15 of article 187 it says its only a high court which can put the certificate away so once

monday alexandra black 22 was attacked sunday while cleaning an animal enclosure with other staff members it was at least the 10th instance of an escape or attack by an animal at a privately run north carolina wildlife facility since 1997 according to the humane society of the united states officials said the lion somehow escaped from a nearby pen and killed the recent college graduate just two weeks after she started working at the conservators center near burlington about 60 miles northwest of raleigh sheriff s deputies shot and killed the animal before retrieving black s body black s passion was the zoological industry this person wanted to spend a lifetime around these animals and i believe that the family was very supportive of that said mindy stinner executive director of the facility before deputies fired on the lion officials made several attempts to tranquilize it or hold it at bay with fire hoses the caswell county sheriff s office said visitors at the center were hustled out of the park stinner said it was not immediately clear how the lion escaped or whether it got out of the enclosure that was being cleaned staff said the lion never made it beyond the park s perimeter fence the park was closed indefinitely as part of an investigation black who was from new palestine indiana graduated from indiana university in may with a degree in animal behavior she had also recently worked at a research and education center in battleground indiana known as wolf park which is home to wolves bison and foxes as she tried to narrow down her interests to a specific field

own and come back with questions she said cara wellman director of iu s center for the integrative study of animal behavior recalled that black was an undergraduate teaching assistant for introductory biology she was very energetic and committed to animal behavior and pursuing a career in animal husbandry wellman said this is silly but what comes to my mind is that she was quiet and sweet that was

and contributions while spending about 600 000 operating the center that year an online public records search indicates the center faced state tax liens totaling thousands of dollars in 2017 while the center is usda licensed animal welfare advocates note that it s not accredited by the association of zoos and aquariums which requires facilities to meet strict animal safety and security standards the humane society has urged north carolina to go beyond the usda licensing standards arguing that it s among four states with particularly lax laws on private ownership of dangerous wild animals the organization pushed for a 2015 bill to make it illegal to own lions tigers and other wild carnivores unless a facility was accredited by aza or met other strict standards the bill passed the state house but not the senate the longer north carolina does nothing as other states continue to pass stricter and stricter laws north carolina is going to see people coming into the state with their collections of dangerous wild animals and the problem is simply going to grow lisa wathne the humane society s director of captive wildlife protection said in an interview the center was founded in 1999 as an educational nonprofit dedicated to providing a specialized home for select carnivore species according to its website the site says it houses 21 species and gets more than 16 000 visitors

governing role in the last five year over the last five years i have worked hard under the leadership of his excellency president professor arthur peter mutharika to make change happen within the boundaries of the ministry positions that i have held he said i believe that our results have delivered positives changes that benefit everyone not just the few he said muluzi who has served in various ministerial positions in the mutharika cabinet said at the ministry of home affairs he guided the establishment of africa s first biometric national id card that we have all now received and

cio icici prudential amc tells et now 2019 is going to be a volatile year that is the reason we have been recommending calling it the sip year cio tells et now edited excerpts when you compare 2018 january with 2019 january our view is that 2019 january shows a greater safety margin than in the same period 2018 in 2018 january most of the market looked fully valued and most of the smallcaps and midcaps looked over valued starting 2019 you find that 80 of the stocks are fairly valued and a small set of stocks could be considered overvalued so from a mutual fund point of view which is long term investor point of view 2019 january is much better time than 2018 january having said that basically what happens is an election year coupled with us fed s last few tightening makes for a volatile year and therefore again from the point view of mutual fund it becomes very easy to look at 2019 as a sip or stp year it is very different from 2018 in 2018 we believed that as you went down the market cap curve there were more risks and now actually there are much more stock picking potentials and you have a much better environment for stock pickers now although it was believed last year was the best year for stock picking but frankly except the four or five mega caps everything else actually went down through the year so 2019 is a more interesting year for all of us it is equally likely to be volatile but i would call it a year to put money and accumulate money in equities at this point time so that is why i like 2019 over 2018 clearly as we speak i believe you are safer in stock picking now rather than going by capitalisation weightage because if you look at largecaps there are clearly 10 stocks which look overvalued at this point of time on the other hand similarly in mid and smallcaps also there are stocks which look overvalued having said that today there are a number of smallcaps that have corrected 30 40 midcaps that have corrected 20 or so i would say 2019 is stock picking time rather than deciding which caps to go and where we have changed look at where we were and consider the calls that we got wrong we did not recognise that oil could come down from 85 to 53 and that actually completely changed the outlook towards sectors like infrastructure or banking which clearly benefit with lower interest rates banks get some treasury profits as well sectors like banking and infrastructure have seen reasonably positive change through the year particularly with the fall in oil clearly banks are in the best situation they have been in the last five six years their cost of borrowing is not going up their lending rates are going up the npl cycle in corporate india is about to get over and lot of provisioning has been built for that npl cycle so banks are in extremely good phase compared after 2015 from a fundamental point of view we are in the best phase for banks and that need not be true for all other parts of the financial services industry but banks are the biggest they have contributed to lower earnings growth in the last six to seven years and they are going to give a cyclical benefit over the next two years in earnings which should help overall earnings of largecaps pretty significantly in the next two years i would be much more positive on corporate focussed banks rather than the retail banks because the retail banks have had a good run over the last six to seven years people make use of valuations as a way of saying that the us market is extremely overvalued when i look at valuations of let us say some of the consumer names they do not look very high clearly the us market required a correction but i am not so worried about us markets the us economy is possibly one of the best economies at this point of time and i do not see the risk of a big fall in us the conditions that existed in 2007 in the form of extra leverage with people and various other problems in the financial system i do not see that kind of a situation at this point of time i got a chance to meet with some good global economists and they say barring corporates to some extent i do not think there is any evidence of extremely high leverage i am basically not worried about big fall in the markets but that does not mean that markets are headed one way upward because there is no fear still in india or many of the markets second look at the ems there was a cycle from 2009 to 2018 which i would call the us cycle and i would even call it the us tech cycle because you can look at companies like ge over the last 10 years and say that nothing has happened in us in 10 years ge has gone down so significantly and i would say that it is the us tech cycle which looks more advanced emerging markets have not had a bull run for a long period of time i am sure that in the last 10 years particularly on a dollar basis emerging markets have shown a significant underperformance i am not in that extremely worried camp the challenge at this point of time is how much positive returns can you make rather than expecting negative returns or minus 20 or something like that in a country like india corporate papers give you 8 9 10 on a three year basis and so the benchmark return that you have to get on corporate papers for equity to deliver is a challenge we are facing this is one of the reasons what we have been always doing is marketing debt funds through the year and contrary to what people think 2018 was a year that most debt funds did well and even today corporate papers are giving you good interest rates so i would say the challenge is how much does equity outperformed debt and that is the challenge rather than worrying too much about equities per se corporate spreads in the post september period have gone up substantially for example you have a situation where 10 year g sec yields have gone down and many of the corporate papers on the three year side has actually been giving good spreads people are looking at 10 year yields and saying interest rates are down i can assure you most of the corporates are actually borrowing at higher rates except may be a few aaa names most of them are borrowing at higher rates than what they were borrowing six months back and that is why i would say debt is remaining an interesting asset class at this point of time particularly shorter duration debt on the corporate side is turning out to be a reasonable interesting asset class 2019 is going to be a volatile year that is the reason we have been recommending calling it the sip year i do not think volatility is going to be any lower in 2019 relative to 2018 but the way we always look at whether oil is going down along with the markets or if it is going up when the markets are going down india is very vulnerable even today to oil going up and markets going down together like it happened in october december when markets and oil fell together i think india will always remain outperforming market because one dollar drop in oil improves india s current account deficit by 1 5 billion or so it becomes a powerful positive for india i would say that more than global markets i will watch oil and i would be worried if oil started to go back to 75 80 if there is global volatility do i worry so much no i do not worry about it having said that do we expect 2019 to be volatile the answer is yes do we have appropriate strategies within our mutual fund to help make money in volatility the answer is yes both through products like sip stp and balanced advantage as a category equity savings as a category etc i would say that we are not really worried about global volatility clearly elections are important us is important and as i keep telling people there is no point in asking fund managers on elections they know nothing that is the way i look at it and but i would say 2019 is a much more interesting year to invest in rather than 2018 and that is the challenge i have in explaining because in 2018 while everything was looking better the valuations of many of the small and midcaps were also much much higher than where they are today it better be because for three years we have lost in consumer stocks on a relative basis because along with earnings going up price to earnings have also been going up the price to earnings of most consumer names today are much higher than what they were three years back we are all trained to think that when you do not have a big capex in a sector finally at the end of that period earnings will catch up if you look at metal stocks from the bottoms of 2015 they have had a meaningful rally although 2018 was not a good year but the 2105 2018 period has been pretty good for metal stocks and i see something similar happening on the cyclical side because if in 10 years virtually no one has started putting up a power plant eventually demand for power will catch up and that is why i am really not worried about a cyclical recovery as long as i am a mutual fund investor i want to invest for the long term the longer it takes time for something to play out the more opportunity i have to get new investors in so that is a positive i get from this whole process and that is why for me it is reasonable if i am a trader and i have kept trading these cyclicals it could have been a problem but i do not see any big worry on the long term at this point of time however consumer names have baffled us we have gone wrong frankly and i would say we always look for other cheaper alternatives and barring 2008 and earlier years we did manage to find stocks which outperformed them but 2018 was a year where it did not work and having said that i believe 2019 is a year where again our stock picking models would certainly work if you look at the global mutual fund industry many of them have very large special situation funds and there are fund managers like anthony bolton who have actually built their entire fame on the basis of special situations i believe that indian markets have moved to a model where special situation investing is likely to work it requires a large active fund management industry because it is a large active fund management industry which is likely to provide stocks to the special situation fund when a problem happens if there is a problem in quality of any product due to which all the active funds start selling that share it is actually the buyer of that share who will be able to get it cheap special situation investing have good scope in the long run clearly because it is one of the techniques to buy cheap and if you manage to buy cheap you have got one part of the investment argument correct you have quality control strikes trade wars government policy and other kinds of sanctions i believe that continuously we are going to be in this phase we are through with the quantitative easing part of the monetary policy in many parts of the world i think we are in a phase where we should be able to identify special situations and that special situation investing allows to buy cheap and i felt if there is such a big global category which has done well in many parts of the world i do not see why it should not do well in india and that is how we looked at it i think that we would be able to buy cheap it is part of our natural style of investing which is to look for problems and i believe here you can create a portfolio which is only based on buying into special situations and the important thing which people have to recognise is it is not necessary that you have to buy the sector in trouble you could buy an unintended beneficiary so if you look when the bank npl cycle happened many years ago the biggest gainers were actually nbfcs and the retail banks so out of that special situation it was not the one with the trouble you buy you sometimes buy unintended beneficiaries and there also it gives you a lot of investment opportunity i think what is the challenge here the challenge is investors have to have a three to five year outlook if people have three month outlook and look at this kind of a strategy i do not think it is likely to work but a three to five year kind of a strategy is certainly one of the strategies which can deliver longer term good returns if you look at the last 10 years there has been wide divergences between the way some sectors like consumer or some of the retail banks have done and how the rest of the market has performed special situation investing requires wider divergence of valuations due to problems that have happened in specific sectors that is one of the reasons to look at 10 year returns of many of the names you will see wide divergences between one set of names and the other set of names and that is the reason it looks interesting from a lump sum point of view also but we always believe a category like special situation does lend itself to systematic investment through sip stp as well today it lends itself to interesting opportunities primarily because the last 10 years have not been normal we had one of the most hated bull markets and in that hated bull market there are names like consumers retail banks and a few others which have done exceptionally well and the rest have done badly because of their own problems from a starting point of view we seem to be in an interesting position having said that clearly the challenge for category like special situation and is that people have to have a three to five year orientation and not a three month orientation that is the challenge we have in communication and that is how we hope investors today are matured enough to look for such high active share products with a three to five year view',\n"," '',\n"," 'the suggestion from the forum for

t conservative enough then he won the presidency despite democrats attempts to portray him as the embodiment of conservatism taken to its extremes debate over trump s relationship with the institutions and personalities of american conservatism is no more settled today than it was on election day 2016 so we asked nine of the right s leading thinkers the question what does it mean to be a conservative in the age of trump here are their answers larry arnn the question of american conservatism in any age is the question of what in america should be conserved there is no consensus about that among conservatives much less among liberals although the liberal consensus in recent years under the thrall of political correctness is gravitating to the view that there is nothing of the past worth saving when this question came up in a primary debate three years ago candidate trump responded that conservatism means conserving america some conservative pundits ridiculed this as displaying trump s ignorance of conservatism indeed it is unlikely trump reads conservative books and journals but his response suggested that he more acutely than many who do read them understood that if we continued politically in the direction of the previous three decades we would lose our country in which case the question of american conservatism would be moot among trump s most loyal supporters have been conservative christians who have cause to understand that their religious freedom is on the brink of destruction would our country still exist if that happened certainly theirs wouldn t there was a sense among the people described by j d vance in hillbilly elegy that they had already lost their country these people appear loyal to trump as do many in the middle class who look to move up but find their way blocked by the regulatory state there might be a pattern here to learn from for conservatives who are open eyed and interested in the possibility of a governing majority today even the legitimacy of caring for one s country in any literal sense is in dispute at november s armistice day ceremony president emmanuel macron of france setting his teeth against trump s support of nationhood declared that patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism macron distorted the meaning of nationalism calling it the egotism of a people who look after only their interests only is a cheat word to have a duty to look after one s people is not to have a duty to look after only them in his speech at the united nations last october trump correctly pointed out that only in sovereign nation states is it possible for free peoples to exercise political consent but trump has bad manners and tweets too much certainly a requirement of conservatism in the age of trump is the ability to see past trump s manners and tweets to political reality and to the dangers and opportunities before us larry arnn is the president of hillsdale college david french to be conservative in the age of trump is to be constantly confronted with a question did you really believe what you said that is did you mean it when you argued for decades that character matters in politicians when you stated clearly and unequivocally that lying under oath or causing others to lie under oath was grounds for impeachment when you condemned unnecessary divisiveness and blatant identity politics when you lamented the negative cultural effect of the clinton presidency in spite of the economic prosperity at the same time the instant you answer yes to those questions and you start to ponder the natural implications of that yes you re immediately confronted with a different set of queries do you still believe in the policy aims of the conservative movement in other words do you still value originalist judges lower taxes and a strong national defense do you seek pro life policies the protection of religious liberty and limitations on the regulatory state this is the life of the conservative in the age of trump all at once long sought policy victories become attainable a positive judicial revolution unfolds our military has struck serious blows against jihadist terrorists overseas these are developments we should cheer but here s the insidious thing if you really truly want to be or feel like a part of the trump team you must either abandon or remain silent about those other things about those other values you hold dear yes good conservatives can and do work in the administration but they do so with the understanding that circumstances may demand their resignation and their true loyalty remains to the constitution not the president we humans are uncomfortable with ambiguity we like to know where and with whom we stand we like to pick a team yet the task of the conservative in the age of trump is to reject that very human impulse and to embrace for a time wandering the uncomfortable wilderness without a tribe that means there may well come a time when we have to urge the impeachment of a man who appoints the judges we love who cuts our taxes and who rebuilds our military that means we have to remind our friends and neighbors that virtuous causes can be discredited by vile champions in short the challenge for the conservative in the age of trump is to continue to believe everything you used to believe because those things are good and true fail in either direction abandon policy to defeat the man or embrace the man to exalt his policies and conservatism will fail it will have sacrificed its credibility on the altar of a single politician and no man is worth that cost david french is a senior fellow at the national review institute and a senior writer at national review mollie hemingway one of the ways that vladimir putin retains power in russia is to permit a systemic yet insincere opposition in the legislature technically these individuals are in an opposing party but they are generally fine with putin s government putin uses them to monitor his opposition and to create an illusion that there s an outlet for contrary opinions for too long the conservative movement in washington d c functioned as the systemic opposition to progressivism s march through american institutions public and private technically they were opposed and they d make some sounds about opposing the growth of the administrative state and the cultural rot but they were never terribly successful at returning the country to its first principles or constitutional order despite the millions of supporters who put them in power and expected not just rhetoric but results conservatism now is about rejecting this rigged system and taking the risk of working outside of it to advance its principles and policy objectives the fact that conservatism had become a checklist of watered down progressive policy prescriptions only served to hasten the demise of the old system what was conservatism s last great accomplishment the expansion of medicare part d the failed efforts to spread democracy by force through the middle east wasted years talking about the repeal and replacement of obamacare sitting idly by while silicon valley tech oligarchs took control of our discourse and set the parameters for acceptable thoughts and speech there is a limit to how long people could ride the high of the reagan years without successive accomplishments conservatism today is properly understood as constitutionalism and a revisiting of first principles about securing the blessings of liberty it s a movement that demands meaningful free trade agreements instead of just agreements based on the hope that someday china will play fair it seeks hearty discussions about national sovereignty and meaningful borders it acknowledges the limits and costs of military action it recognizes that crouching cowardice in the face of cultural losses led the country to its current precipice where people are terrified to speak freely and speak the truth and it doesn t care one whit if it has to completely upset the existing political order mollie hemingway is a senior editor at the federalist erick erickson i am a conservative because i am a christian i know that all of us are sinners so i want as few in charge of me as possible today conservatism seems to be about what our side can get out of the system instead conservatism should be what it has always been about elevating the individual over the state and restraining the petty vanities of the collective self whether in the form of the state or the mob the mob has masked thugs and social justice warriors attempting to silence or ruin any who disagree with them the state has cops and revenue agents conservatism must restrain both instead of looking to strongmen in washington as saviors conservatism must favor building up strong men and women individually across the nation who can take care of themselves and their families a family dependent on government is a family dependent on the enslaving generosity of progressivism from which rarely a person escapes scripturally conservatism must be an ideology that seeks the welfare of the cities from which we are in exile we as conservatives must be reminded that a washington able to do much can also cause great damage conservatism should incentivize localism restraint at the federal level and charity in one s own community what is right in one region of the country may not be right in another we must resist the temptation to think we can fundamentally change human nature through collective enterprise at the national scale a conservative in the age of trump is now the most skilled diplomat in our society he balances the friendships and jealousies of friends who embrace the president against those who disdain the president while all supposedly working on common ground too many a conservative now has thrown their lot in with power for the sake of power in a tolkienesque manner they have decided that they can wield the ring of power and abandon its destruction the conservatism that will ultimately see us through the present age is the one that rejects the ring and the strongman and stays committed to those things that bound our souls out of eden men are sinners god is real and no city on earth can be trusted to preserve liberty if the sinners themselves cannot be empowered to preserve their own erick erickson is host of the erick erickson show on wsb radio atlanta and the editor of the resurgent alexandra desanctis my college graduation took place two weeks after donald trump defeated ted cruz in the indiana primary all but securing the republican nomination three weeks before trump officially accepted the nomination i began my first post grad job as a writer to state the obvious this was not the landscape i d imagined growing up as someone wanting to be a conservative writer i never expected to see an era of donald trump in american politics as a young conservative the last three years have inured me to constant outrage cycles and already dulled my ability to expect anything other than disappointment from politics the ideas that first drew me to conservatism support for tradition the free market small government and personal virtue now seem in short supply on the right but the fact that trump has discarded many of these norms or that his supporters have shamelessly sought to reshape them around his person doesn t mean that the conservative movement has been fundamentally transformed to be sure the president has endeavored to remake the republican party in his image and the vast majority of the right has willingly participated his reality television presidency has provoked politicians pundits and thinkers across the political spectrum into losing their heads right wing figures who once moralized about leaders needing character and integrity are quick to excuse trump s worst misdeeds formerly conservative commentators now insist pell mell that all good americans must vote for democrats to save the country this is an increasingly challenging climate for those desiring a politics of principle rather than of personality while there is little cause for naive optimism there remains room for hope donald trump has scrambled our politics changed the trajectory of the gop and fractured conservatism but he hasn t killed it no one person can do that that reality offers a particularly salient reminder for the right and anyone else willing to acknowledge it this period of upheaval confirms the conservative wariness against making politicians the center of our lives or create a government so vast that each election becomes an existential struggle our political views and goals should never be defined solely by the woes and whims of one man and more important politics can t be everything the trump era cautions conservatives and americans of good faith not to put our faith in princes that s a deeply conservative value that will outlast our tumultuous moment alexandra desanctis is a staff writer at national review david frum to be a conservative in the age of trump is to know what you are against more clearly than what you are for aside from the familiar commitment to tax cuts for upper income people and corporations and state level action to reduce ballot access for poorer people and minorities policy changes in the age of trump have been few and tentative where s the promised obamacare replacement where s the action against the opioid crisis the border wall the one big new idea of the trump era global trade war seems designed to ensure that the u s meets the challenge from china with the fewest possible allies and supporters is to espouse an ideology fiercely rejected by its most loyal voters conservatism is supposedly an anti statist philosophy yet trump era conservatism depends on votes of the biggest winners from statist redistribution retirees rural people military veterans farmers measure the 50 states by their net claim contribution to the national finances and nine of the 10 biggest takers are solid red states is to feel culturally powerless as conservatism recedes from knowledge centers conservatives come to seem less knowledgeable their opinions carry less intellectual and moral weight conservatives increasingly have internalized this weightlessness above all things they feel judged harshly and unfairly judged they resent it is to be enmired in the unsolvable moral dilemma of donald trump every day president trump does something astonishing and outrageous from defaming military heroes to organizing payoffs to porn stars he receives millions of dollars in payments from foreign entities ignores ethics rules courts dictators insults allies and blabs national secrets to the russian ambassador in the oval office he lies and lies to be a conservative in the age of trump is to struggle every day whether to ignore condone or even outright justify the actions of donald trump it s a test and the majority are failing in ways that will be remembered for a long time to be a conservative in the age of trump is thus a heavy destiny but not nearly as heavy or difficult as the destiny that awaits conservatives after trump this country will always need a politics for the non left a politics of continuity with the american past of private enterprise and limited government of prudent skepticism of grand schemes for human uplift how can non left politics redeem itself from the maelstrom of trumpism on a successful answer to that question the future of the american experiment will turn david frum is a staff writer at the atlantic and the author of trumpocracy the corruption of the american republic henry olsen anyone trying to understand what conservatism means post trump should look to the old english advice for brides on their wedding day something old something new something borrowed something blue each phrase points toward an aspect of the new trumpian conservatism conservatives still believe in some of the old verities we still support cutting taxes we still back judges who judge rather than legislate from the bench we are still are pro life pro family and friendly toward traditional christian religion we still support a strong robust military that can protect america from conventional and unconventional foes new aspects of conservatism center on immigration and trade conservatives today largely back restricting the number and types of immigrants who come to our land there are many arguments within this camp but gone are the days when bush style immigration policies that winked at illegal immigration ruled the roost the same holds for trade conservative voters largely believe that free trade deals have cost america jobs and even some conservative intellectuals and leaders are beginning to realize there is no republican political majority for a trade policy that treats native born americans without a college degree as collateral damage in the war to eradicate global poverty this means that the new gop has borrowed some of its old pre new deal identity go back to the 1920s the last time the republican party was the working person s party and you ll find it was anti immigration pro tariff and suspicious of american involvement overseas the new conservatism is much more modern on all counts but the giddy turn of the millennium confidence is gone if you find this shift distasteful or worse chances are you have moved to the democrats or are in that uneasy space occupied by the remaining never trump conservatives that doesn t mean conservatives are wholly satisfied with their lot our president is crude brash often rash his past leaves a lot to be desired and all but the most starry eyed maga man sometimes feels ashamed he s our guy so where does this leave conservatism that depends on where you thought it was before he came on the scene if you thought american conservatism was healthy pre trump then you re probably upset and unreconciled to the new age but if like me you thought it was suffering from a terminal illness one that unless treated quickly would bring about its demise then you see the glass at least half full trump is like a serious medication that causes painful side effects and which isn t guaranteed to cure the patient but given the options on hand when the gop went to the metaphorical hospital in the 2016 primaries he might have been the only hope it had henry olsen is a senior fellow at the ethics and public policy center and an adjunct professor at villanova university ben sasse conservatism is gratitude and skepticism it is gratitude for the inherent dignity of every individual and for all of the institutions and communities we inherit and create but it is also skepticism of utopian visions that rely on coercion and force conservatism is much more than simply anger at the increasingly cynical politics of washington conservatives believe that the most important challenges and opportunities are almost always bigger than what governments can reach even when government is working well that is because government is about power whereas the center of life is about love conservatives want limited government because we believe in limitless human dignity our constitution sets a framework for ordered liberty based on our shared understanding that family and friendship worship and community life are the things that give us meaning when those start to crumble politics fills the void and takes on too much meaning our current screwed up politics is in part a consequence of overreaching decisions made in washington over the last few decades the choice to turn judicial confirmations into hyperpartisan cage fights the choice by congress to surrender legislative power to unelected bureaucrats but the deepest sources of our ache are not political as families and local communities have broken down we have become lonelier as traditional stable work has disappeared we have grown anxious as local institutions churches little leagues rotary clubs have evaporated we have lost a sense of common cause to numb these losses many americans have turned to drugs politics has become a type of drug americans feel more tied to tv talking heads than to their next door neighbors and cable news shouting matches and social media smackdowns are ways of feeling like we re part of something bigger something important it shouldn t come as a surprise that people who don t have many face to face friends end up forming virtual mobs a conservatism suited not just to the next two years but to the next two decades must be re oriented toward restoring renewing and protecting the institutions of private life we need strong tight knit families our neighborhoods need service organizations that bring isolated people together we need educational institutions that understand the importance of the liberal arts to produce rooted and well adjusted men and women during a time when our economy is moving in a more rootless and global direction we need churches and religious organizations that are free to serve the least of these and to share the good news with people who haven t heard much good news lately a conservatism worth its name must be focused on conserving the things that make life worth living communities and ordered liberty above all progressivism is about government coercion pushing for what might work conservatism is primarily about what has worked for the neighbors we re called to love ben sasse a republican is a u s senator from nebraska w james antle iii for a timely illustration of the tensions in modern american conservatism look no further than meghan mccain s eulogy for her father she praised the longtime arizona senator 2008 republican presidential nominee and war hero as a great man listing his public deeds and enumerating his virtues yet as she talked about her wedding and childhood skinned knees it was clear she loved him not just for his greatness but first of all because he was hers at the time of his death john mccain was perhaps the right s foremost exponent of america as an idea a creedal nation with no roots in blood and soil under president trump who ran promising to make america great again conservatives have embraced nationalism and an enhanced sense of place as the veteran conservative journalist john o sullivan has put it america is not just an idea it is a nation a healthy nationalism is similar to the love between parents and children we don t love our parents or children because they hold the correct philosophical views we take pride in their accomplishments but already loved them before they accomplished anything we don t want our parents to beat up all the other parents on the block and our love for our children is not manifest by enslaving other people s children so it is with a country as it happens america is by many measures great there is also much wisdom in the ideas that undergird the declaration of independence and the constitution but loving america is as much about the great plains rocky mountains and fenway park or if you prefer yankee stadium as it about believing in natural rights that come from our creator nationalism isn t always healthy just as the cold war era fusionists sought to balance virtue and liberty nationalism without the universalizing influences of religion and classical liberalism can quickly degenerate into something ugly and hateful it can also devolve into worship of the state the political expression of the nation which is nevertheless distinct from it pre trump conservatism had grown too abstract and disconnected from the mystic chords of memory that bind a people together but trump himself is not up to the task of summoning americans to a shared national identity bigger than party race or class because he is in many ways a small man whether governed by trump or mccain america was already great and it is ours the task facing conservatives is to sustain that love of country while heeding edmund burke and trying to keep our country lovely w james antle iii is editor of the american conservative and author of devouring freedom can big government ever be stopped',\n"," 'local land sold near chatham park in pittsboro see who bought it the halle companies a maryland based real estate developer

bank psb chairmen would intermittently say the worst was over for state owned lenders during post results media interactions such statements would invariably be taken with a pinch of salt but any such assertion now would have the heft of the reserve bank of india s financial stability report fsr behind it story continues below advertisement remove ad the fsr makes a forceful case that the environment for public sector banks is improving albeit gradually not only has the gross non performing assets gnpa ratio of all banks reduced to 10 8 percent in september 2018 from 11 5 percent in march 2018 it is expected to slip further for psbs in particular it is projected to reduce from 14 8 percent in september 2018 to 14 6 percent in march 2019 and 14 3 percent in september 2019 that s under the baseline scenario what s important is that even under a severe stress scenario these are hypothetical models of extreme economic conditions and rarely come to pass gnpas are forecast to decline gradually that clearly shows that recognition of the stress in the system is over at least for psbs this is supported by other data as well for instance the annualised slippage ratio fresh additions to the stock of npas during a year as a proportion of total standard assets at the beginning of the year has come down from 7 6 percent in march 2018 to 4 1 percent in september 2018 the improvement has been remarkable for credit to industry one of the main culprits for the bad loan stock here the slippage ratio has come down from 13 6 percent to 5 percent during the same period that s the good news one would expect psbs to take advantage of this gradually improving environment and claw back market share ceded to private sector peers and shadow banks over the last half decade but that will take some time because of their precarious capital position the fsr has pointed out that bank profitability continues to erode under rbi s baseline scenario without taking into account any capital infusion from the government system level capital adequacy ratio is projected to come down to 12 9 percent in march 2019 from 13 4 percent in september 2018 the fsr warns that as many as eight psbs under the prompt corrective action framework will see their capital adequacy ratio slip to below 9 percent by march if they don t get additional government capital that may not come to pass on december 20 the government sought parliament s approval for supplementary grants worth rs 41 000 crore to infuse fresh capital into psbs mostly those under the pca framework however it remains to be seen how this money is distributed and whether some of it will go to stronger psbs who are actually in a position to grow but there are limits to how much the government can infuse as it struggles with a fiscal deficit that has breached 115 percent of budget estimates and has to contend with populist expenditure in an election year thus what s clear is that psbs will continue to be hamstrung for growth capital for some time one way they could get some capital is if some of the big cases under the bankruptcy process are resolved that way the recoveries flow straight to the bottom line and can be used to bolster capital but given the track record of the big rbi 12 cases so far that remains a pipe dream at least over the next six months',\n"," 'looking back on 2018 there were a lot of

domaingang reported that rick purchased motherfuckers com for 4 500 on sedo back in september rick made some interesting comments in 2018 the domain industry is a dirty rotten industry such as it is and again let me state clearly there is no industry there is no association that represents rank and file domainers there are no standards of conduct and to be honest the window of opportunity on this has all but closed there is no domain industry and there never will be domainers are very charitable but charity starts at home when the money was flying around we helped many causes but we never cemented or protected our own cause in an effective meaningful and long lasting way that window of opportunity is gone in october rick explained what a real domainer does and knows personally i thought the most interesting thing rick said was that he would not get into domaining if starting today would i get into domaining today absolutely not can you still make money with domains absolutely but when you buy a domain at least realize that the money invested is buried and it will be buried for a very long time there is no cashier they are not liquid you own it and there is less than a 50

the benefit of com price caps were passed along to consumers seemed provocative and then ms mcpherson decided to go after domain investors at one time calling them scalpers until someone said edit that now so scalpers became scalping and it went something like this turncommerce and godaddy are not the only ones profiting from com price caps domain speculation or domain scalping as some call it has become a highly profitable industry unto itself in fact one of the top domain name speculators in this market reports a net worth of 500 million these speculators even have their own lobbying group the internet commerce association ica where turncommerce and godaddy are members via their subsidiaries namebright and afternic yeah bite the hand that feeds you mike pointed out why he thought verisign were framing domainers as scalpers mike felt they purposely used the term scalpers as it will be needed to vilify the rightful owners of the domain names they seek to charge whatever price it will be a political battle and by arguing these scalpers add no value will make their case seem more righteous the other point mike made was what are people going to really do if a big holder wants to drop a ton of valuable names there will be buyers and verisign knows that even better yet in a world with no price caps they get to be the speculator and charge whatever they like this would be years away but still something to think about and mike also mentioned that he thought most big holders should absolutely have always owned some verisign stock as a hedge the saga of cqd com cqd com involved

2019 new year s message premier alden mclaughlin said the cruise berthing facility and expanded cargo project in george town remains an important element in the cayman islands economic future still citing figures that have been called into question during the course of 2018 despite the continued opposition to the project as well as the damage to george town s existing cargo dock from a recent storm which raised new concerns about the threats the piers could pose mclaughlin said that his government would be moving forward on delivering the project in 2019 undeterred by the divisions the project is causing and the campaign for a people initiated referendum on the issue mclaughlin used the external pressures on offshore finance and future economic uncertainties to justify the costly project at a time when significant economic threats are looming we cannot and must not turn our backs on 245 million of net economic benefit hundreds of construction jobs and then decades of increasing employment and business opportunities for caymanians that the cruise berths will bring he said even though the figure of 245 million remains in question and government has failed to detail those new jobs and benefits neither can we turn our backs on the opportunity to modernise and enlarge our now out dated cargo port it is essential that we deliver this critically important project and continue moving cayman forward preparing us for the future the premier added however the nor wester that brought relatively high seas over the christmas weekend which damaged the existing dock at the cargo port has raised further concerns about the dredging of george town harbour opponents of the project are questioning what would happen if there was a spate of similar weather or worse once the project has been completed representatives for the cruise port referendum campaign have pointed out that without the reefs in the harbour the waves on 21 and 22 december would have been much more destructive what would the damage and maintenance to george town and the proposed dock be had we experienced more extreme conditions and even a hurricane campaigners asked in the wake of the christmas

his administration over the past five and a half years and set out other plans for the new year mclaughlin pointed to the creation of a new ministry of international trade investment aviation and maritime affairs and the opening of a cayman office in hong kong he said the development of the workforce opportunities and residency cayman worc to oversee the labour market work permit and residency regimes would ensure that all caymanians had a fair opportunity for gainful employment in the growing economy the premier said the new cayman islands coast guard and the customs and border control agency would make cayman more secure while noting challenges such as brexit the pressure on the offshore sector and the constitutional talks with the uk the premier was nevertheless confident that cayman was on track for further growth he also pointed to the celebrations next year to mark the 60th anniversary of cayman s first constitution in 1959 we have certainly come far over the past 60

from january to march us current account data shows story continues below advertisement remove ad the repatriation bonanza followed new regulations that allowed the us government to tax profits accumulated overseas regardless of where the money was held prior rules allowed companies to defer us tax on worldwide profits unless they repatriated the money the change offered a powerful incentive to bring home some of the 3 trillion us firms were believed to hold in jurisdictions ranging from ireland to switzerland either in cash or in securities such as us treasuries but investment bank jpmorgan said the flows were on a rapidly decelerating trajectory the current account data shows repatriation in all sectors looking at just non financial companies jpmorgan calculates 60 billion was repatriated in the third quarter versus 225 billion in the first quarter and 115 billion in the second quarter because companies had probably already pre booked a one off tax hit for the year repatriation will have dwindled further in the last quarter it predicted repatriation flows are also evident from data released by the treasury international capital or tic that shows treasury bond

placing a floor under stock markets but us equities have endured a dismal few months as worries have grown for economic growth the last quarter of 2018 has been the worst for the s p500 index since the end of 2008 when the lehman brothers crisis erupted should flows dwindle further the extra boost that us repatriation provided to us equity and bond markets via share buybacks and corporate bond redemptions would likely dissipate next year jpmorgan told clients bond markets meanwhile saw reduced issuance as companies drew instead on repatriation proceeds the 10 biggest us multinationals including six tech companies sold zero bonds in 2018 after raising 80 billion annually on average in the previous three years goldman sachs said noting this had supported bond performance in 2018 the dollar may be affected less a significant part of the offshore held cash is already believed to be in dollars whether cash or treasuries however repatriation probably supported the currency at the margins by tightening dollar supply outside the united states so dwindling flows could act as another drag on the greenback',\n"," 'a car park brawl with police started when a teenage mother smashed a
