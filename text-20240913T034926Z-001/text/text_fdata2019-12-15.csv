as local investors seek to assess implications for australia canberra will be on the radar to start the week with the mid year economic and fiscal outlook although the near term economic and fiscal forecasts are likely to be downgraded nab economics kaixin owyong said she does not expect the government to announce a material fiscal stimulus given its commitment to a non negotiable goal of a 2019 20 surplus ms owyong said the government is likely to downgrade its near term economic forecasts gdp the labour market and inflation have been much weaker than expected and unlikely to meet the april budget forecasts for 2019 20 of 2¾ growth 5 unemployment and 2¼ inflation as for the medium term economic forecasts ms owyong said they were unlikely to be revised much if at all even though we are concerned that growth could continue to disappoint given the deterioration in private sector demand history shows that myefo forecasts find it very difficult to predict the current financial year budget outcome typically reflecting misses on forecasting both the economy and commodity prices the nab economist also said in our view economic weakness suggests further stimulus is required to reduce unemployment and lift inflation ms owyong said while monetary policy works with long and variable lags fiscal stimulus is well placed to support the economy in the near term given the low cost of borrowing and the health of the government s balance sheet advertisement in the short run bringing forward personal income tax cuts or providing cash hand outs would provide helpful support to households while infrastructure spending is important to the medium term economic outlook unfortunately such stimulus seems unlikely until at least the may budget and would be constrained by the

china enterprises index rose 2 1 per cent in his weekend comment on the phase one trade deal csis s mr kennedy said it would appear that the agreement represents a win for china based on available information in the short term china and xi jinping are the clear winners with only limited concessions china has been able to preserve its mercantilist economic system and continue its discriminatory industrial policies at the expense of china s trading partners and the global economy trump could reverse course and renew tariffs but beijing has bought itself a likely respite from the daily uncertainty for at least a few months and perhaps for the remainder of trump s current term the trade war has cast a negative light on both the us and china mr kennedy also said although the trump and xi administrations deserve credit for finding their way to a deal they both deserve blame for the downward spiral in the relationship advertisement china has operated on the conceit that its market is so large that it could act with impunity and that even the united states would never press them in a sustained way conversely washington has acted under the incorrect assumption that denying access to the us market in and of itself was sufficient leverage to force beijing to change course both sides heavily miscalculated resulting in an amazing amount of collateral damage currencies td securities the good news from the uk election is that the worst may be over but the downside is that gbp has priced in excessive optimism we think the fresh upside is limited but coupled with the easing of us china trade tensions risk markets should benefit into yearend together with a fed that sees some optimism on the external environment this backdrop reinforces the recent top in the broad usd capital economics looking further ahead sees little change to sterling over the year ahead given the short time to reach a trade deal between the uk and the eu that said we think that the pm will eventually backtrack and ask for an extension ruling out a cliff edge exit at the end of 2020 when that happens we forecast that sterling will rise some more to us1 40 by the end of 2021 and looser fiscal policy compounded with tighter monetary policy further ahead in our view will lead the 10 year gilt yield to rise to 1 25 per cent by then commodities advertisement benchmark copper on the london metal

membership in the european union eu has been a topic of debate in the united kingdom ever since the country joined the european economic community in 1973 just two years after joining the u k held its first referendum on the issue of continuing membership in the common market thirty one years later the nation held its second referendum on the same issue and opted to depart it s been more than three years since that vote during which brexit has been a subject of considerable uncertainty but yesterday s elections offer some additional clarity to britain its trading partners and the financial markets the last u k elections in 2017 saw former prime minister pm theresa may lose her gamble for a larger majority that would bolster her position in brexit negotiations the tories were left with fewer seats and the seeds were sown for may s eventual downfall two and a half years later her successor current pm boris johnson won his gamble for additional leverage securing a resounding majority in this week s election the outcome should clear the way for the u k to leave the eu on january 31 the brexit deal that johnson worked out with his european counterparts in october details the terms of the separation the u k will leave the eu customs union de align from european regulations by the end of 2020 and seek a limited free trade agreement with the eu eu citizens working in britain will be allowed to stay and a 39 billion divorce bill has been agreed the resolution could help arrest the persistent economic decline that britain has suffered since the end of 2016 importantly the tentative deal does a reasonable job of addressing the difficult issue of the irish border which should preserve the considerable trade between northern ireland and the republic of ireland under the terms of the deal northern ireland would become part of the u k customs territory rather than the eu customs area and would comply with certain eu rules legally there would be a customs border between northern ireland and the republic of ireland the checks however would take place on a customs border between great britain and the island of ireland with goods being checked at points of entry in northern ireland with renewed leverage in parliament reports suggest that johnson is aiming for a parliamentary vote before christmas that would allow plenty of time for the europeans to secure the needed assent from their members if all goes smoothly britain will begin a transition period in february that will involve a great deal of work the election resolves some brexit uncertainty but leaves many unknowns the u k will have to negotiate a trade agreement with the eu to ensure continued tariff free access to the market after the transition period so as not to invite other members to contemplate departure european leaders are unlikely to make this an easy process outside of europe the u k will have to conclude a huge number of new trade agreements since britain will no longer be covered by the eu agreed treaties so far britain has signed 20 continuity deals covering 50 countries or territories but those trade agreements represent only over 8 of total u k trade johnson has stressed his intent to leave the eu without seeking to extend the transition period currently set to close at the end of 2020 his stridence may have been designed to play well with the hard core brexit supporters who have been central to his leadership so far but the results of the election give johnson a much broader base of support including some traditional labour strongholds this may lead him to be more flexible in both the timing of brexit work and the closeness of the new relationship the u k will share with the eu though not our base case if both the u k and eu fail to reach a trade agreement the end of the transition period would see the terms default to those of the world trade organization this would effectively translate to a no deal brexit in terms of trade almost all british exports would be subject to the same tariffs and policies as the eu applies to goods from the u s or china the absence of a backstop after the transition period is a key difference between johnson s plan and the one championed by theresa may brexit uncertainty has caused economic pain manufacturing has been on a downward trend business investment has fallen and jobs have been moving out of the country investors are pulling out money from real estate funds based in the u k clarity over the road ahead will help limit damage going forward but most economists find that brexit will result in a permanent loss of economic output apart from brexit looser fiscal policy was another focus during the election campaign both of the leading parties proposed a turn against austerity under the tory manifesto additional fiscal stimulus of 7 3 billion essentially through tax cuts would likely have a modest effect on the u k economy in fact the party has proposed to reverse the government s plan to cut the corporation tax from 19 to 17 from april 2020 this probably reflects in part limitations imposed by the party s new fiscal rule brexit does not end with the withdrawal agreement the brexit resolution will have implications for monetary policy as well current bank of england boe governor mark carney s term closes at the end of january the new boe governor who will be appointed by johnson s new government may have to with deal with pressure from downing street to support the economy as a former member of the monetary policy committee at the boe said a person who takes up mark carney s role would have to be deeply committed to the u k s well being or have an unbelievable desire for a challenge while labour and other opposition parties highlighted other issues this election will likely be remembered as the one that will get brexit done even if the british parliament finally votes to leave the eu much still needs to be resolved and brexit will remain a topic of debate as we have noted before this is not the beginning of the end but rather the end of the beginning will the boulder stay uphill in the 1993 movie groundhog day a television news reporter finds himself trapped in a day that keeps repeating every morning he wakes up in the same room of the same small town hearing the same dated sonny and cher pop song and banter from the alarm clock the protagonist and the audience are left wondering why he is doomed to relive february 2 over and over again the i got you babe of economic news this year has been repeated rumors of progress on a u s china trade deal over the past two months we again heard reports of talks and halting progress but late this week the u s announced a limited trade deal with china as of the time of writing details are still emerging and no paper has been signed but it appears the long rumored phase one deal is taking shape negotiations accelerated this week ahead of a key deadline as of this sunday december 15 the u s was scheduled to implement 15 tariffs on nearly all chinese imports that are not yet subject to tariffs this last tranche included high dollar value consumer goods including mobile phones and computers neither side would have gained from escalation u s consumers would see price increases while china would see lower demand for its products digesting the details of this preliminary agreement we must bear in mind that disappointments have precedents too talks at the start of the year proved fruitless and the tariff increase scheduled for january 1 occurred on may 10 subsequent talks yielded nothing but more tariffs roughly half of which took effect september 1 with the remainder left hanging as the december 15 threat if china does not honor its commitments the u s will not hesitate to raise tariffs again the new china agreement has a new feature de escalation until this point the only concessions by the u s have been postponements of threatened tariffs this deal s reduction in the tariff rate is new ground for the trump administration but we offer argentina and brazil as a cautionary tale they had enjoyed a waiver from the u s steel and aluminum tariffs but due to circumstances beyond their control saw the reprieve withdrawn suddenly even if the tariffs against china are lightened or removed they can be put back in place china sought a complete rollback of the current tariffs but the u s enjoyed the leverage that tariffs convey and compromised with a partial reduction to a subset of tariff rates the u s wanted formal quotas for agricultural purchases and china reportedly overcame its reluctance and made a modest commitment but it appears those were the extent of the compromises the push to complete a preliminary deal has sidelined the core issues that initially sparked the confrontation including china s industrial subsidies and import barriers phase one is the first of many rounds of u s china trade talks with an election in sight no president would welcome a recession the risk of tariffs slowing the economy likely motivated the trump administration to move away from escalation but thus far markets have not punished the u s strong approach to negotiations the economy is broadly performing well and equity markets have had a favorable year any pain in the u s has been limited to specific sectors that have witnessed cost increases or lost sales notably farming much uncertainty remains and much work lies ahead nearly two years of talks have yielded an incomplete agreement china s protections and an array of u s tariffs remain in place future rounds will require negotiators to move on to more difficult matters in groundhog day after innumerable days of malaise the lead character breaks out of his time loop by changing his attitude he embraces his adopted community approaches his job vigorously and builds a new relationship with his colleagues he selflessly seeks the best outcomes for everyone around him we hope negotiators for the u s and china can build on this week s momentum to find their way to a better place a giant legacy carl reflects on the life and times of paul volcker i last saw paul volcker at a conference two years ago and he was still a presence then 90 his posture wasn t perfect but he still towered over the rest of us the impactful decades he spent in the arena of financial policy lent an immense gravitas to his reflections at an age when most have retired he was anything but retiring paul volcker died this week at the age of 92 his passing prompted voluminous reflections on his life and times one of the best of them can be found here he was a key figure in the treasury department when the united states dropped the gold standard in 1971 and served as chairman of the federal reserve system from 1979 to 1987 volcker was a larger than life figure when he assumed leadership at the fed inflation was raging and seemed to defy all attempts to control it volcker inspired by the chicago school of economics inflation is everywhere and always a monetary phenomenon placed strict controls on the money supply the strategy produced high interest rates and economic pain in the short run but much more manageable inflation in the long run money supply targeting actually proved short lived financial innovation made it more difficult to measure money and link it to economic activity but volcker and the fed made a seamless transition to the interest rate targeting regime that persists to this day volcker s tenure also illustrated the value of central bank independence a concept unfortunately questioned today in his later years volcker remained an important voice in the arena of financial policy in all his public service spanned almost 60 years the economic prosperity and sensational market performance seen in the past four decades would not have been possible without volcker s vision and determination he was willing to suffer the slings and arrows of critics during the economic depths of the early 1980s he received unneeded lumber from idled and angry home builders but the housing industry along with the rest of us owes paul volcker an immense debt physically and reputationally he was a towering figure
the us dollar remains at a critical juncture as fed policy will be on hold for the foreseeable future and as we start to see an economic rebound come out of europe the world s largest and strongest economy is likely to start to see economic growth slow in the fourth quarter further cementing the belief that the fed will have no changes in policy for the foreseeable future with europe starting to have some major macro events fall into place for them we could see the dollar react more to rebounding european data than to sluggish numbers from the us the overall tone with risk appetite will focus on both the aftermaths of the uk general election and the details with the phase one deal agreement between the us and china the focus will also fall onto the whether we see an improvement in china s november activity data and a plethora of rate decisions the boj and boe are widely to keep policy unchanged but we could see sweden s riksbank tighten policy while mexico s banxico cuts rates gbp whatever you think of the uk election result it s clear that this result partially lifts the cloud of uncertainty that s held back the currency and the economy for so long as the old adage goes the markets hate uncertainty as we know they re not too fond of brexit either but that s a discussion for another day for now no deal brexits have vanquished the upcoming boe meeting will be governor carney s last meeting and to be honest more attention will probably be paid on who boris johnson picks to be the next governor it will be interesting to see how much reference the policy statement provides regarding the election outcome eur the december flash pmi surveys and german ifo business confidence report could have serious impact on whether we see eur usd breakout higher if the bottom is in place for economic growth in the region we should see continue to see services remain resilient and upticks with the manufacturing readings oil from a macro economic perspective oil prices could rip higher after both trade and brexit uncertainty have been alleviated in the short term oil could still rally another 5 here despite oversupply concerns for the first half of 2020 because investors have been overly negative with their demand side forecasts gold gold has remained resilient throughout the 24 hour wave of global risk appetite because the dollar is finally breaking it seems remarkable that gold is higher after a phase one trade deal seems imminent brexit no deal risks have been wiped out and we are in the midst of a massive global stock market rally gold could see further momentum after the euphoria of this risk on move is faded investors will still have appetite for safe havens as we enter a very lengthy brexit transition phase and are not anywhere close to

strides made with mainstream acceptance mxn positive trade news boosted the mexican peso against the dollar this week the peso appreciated from weekly lows of 19 29 down to briefly breaking below 19 after a us china limited trade deal could be announced soon the usmca also got the necessary tweaks to get the rubber stamp from the democrats as the us mexico and canada representatives hammered out the revisions emerging markets in general are trading higher as risk appetite is on the rise after a potential truce is now close to a reality anonymous sources claim the deal could already be signed just waiting for an announcement before the december 15 tariffs kick in some of the positive momentum will be less next week as the mexican central bank is expected to cut its benchmark rate by 25 basis points the rate cut is already priced in but in the last meeting two out of the five members voted for a 50 basis points cut economic data has been disappointing and although under less pressure if trade news is to be believed the mexican economy is struggling to get out of the technical recession it fell into earlier this year country hong kong protests have kicked off again with record numbers turning out last weekend they were reportedly peaceful and this was the first demonstration that had been officially sanctioned warnings about a self imploding economy seem to be falling on deaf ears and tuesday s unemployment rate could turn nasty as always there is the risk that protests turn violent again which would be negative for the hk33 index usd hkd is still in the upper half of the trading band china we re still waiting for an announcement regarding the phase 1 trade deal between the us and china both sides remain in constant daily contact reportedly and are always close to a deal china s export numbers released last weekend were dismal and may jolt china toward a faster deal recent talk is that the december 15 imposition of more tariffs by the us will be either postponed or suspended on monday we see china s industrial production and retail sales data ip has been surprisingly robust but the weak exports data might suggest the downside is vulnerable india indian equities have been sliding since the rbi failed to cut its benchmark rate last week there are no major data points to impact markets next week australia the next major focus for australia will be thursday s release of the november jobs report given that the rba has said it will be a major data point to influence monetary policy a weak number will push the rba toward a more dovish stance new zealand the nz economy appears to be steadily plodding along q3 growth data are due on thursday and expectations are for 2 0 y y after 2 1 in q2 a rebound in dairy prices has helped the kiwi but a weaker gdp print will be bearish for the local dollar latam politics latin american leaders might be breathing a sigh of relief at a us china tariff truce as the prolonged trade war took its toll in emerging markets which in turn heightened wealth inequality making social protests a common occurrence in the region the protests in santiago are ongoing and have taken the peso to record lows central bank and government intervention reduced the fall of the currency but it is only now with trade optimism that a recovery can begin the biggest risk is another disappointment when the two sides appear close to a deal this would not be the first time this has happened the urgency of the situation and the high political states for donald trump ahead of an election year could pave the way for a deal that if struck would boost risk appetite uk politics now that boris johnson has massive majority markets will look to see how hard of a brexit will he pursue brexit risks remain as we still could see eu trade talks completely fall apart a tremendous amount of nationalization risk has been lifted but now the clock begins for johnson to get all of their trading relationship agreements done next year business want certainty over the transition period and until we get that we could see limited rallies in sentiment and investment us politics now that the house judiciary committee is moving forward with two articles of impeachment against president trump we will see this get voted through in the house but ultimately this will not get voted through the republican held senate impeachment risks are

weekend dashboard managing conflicting signals note the report is published to members of epb macro research every other weekend click the link at the bottom of this article to learn more about our first quarterly webcast presentation this week ended with what we now believe to be the culmination of a phase 1 trade deal with china risk assets enjoyed another trade fueled rally as tensions eased and market participants believe that global growth will be positively benefited from these new developments cyclical equity sectors rallied the most on the week with oil and gas xop regional banks kre and technology xlk posting the largest gains defensive and interest rate sensitive sectors were flat to down emerging market bonds investment grade bonds high yield bonds and treasury bonds all gained on the week despite significant volatility commodities and precious metals broadly gained on the week as real interest rates declined asset class performance table stocks bonds source bloomberg epb macro research international equities outperformed the s p 500 this past week as the usd declined against both major currencies and emerging market currencies the average international equity etf in the table below was up 2 0 on the week compared to 0 8 for the s p 500 europe ezu rose by 1 5 asset class performance table international stocks currencies source bloomberg epb macro research the usd has fallen again major currencies over the past one week one month and three month time periods a continued breakdown of the us dollar would confirm the short term divergence developing between the us and global growth international trends in europe similar to the united states inflation expectations have moved off the cyclical low there is limited data at this point to suggest a new cyclical rise in inflation is a likely scenario but evidence of stabilization something reflected in some market based inflation readings is more probable eur inflation swap forward 5y5y source bloomberg epb macro research in the last report about three weeks ago the market expected about 28bps of rate cuts in the next year today the market is roughly in the same spot expecting about 23bps of rate cuts from the federal reserve with much volatility the market has returned to a position that includes an expectation of roughly one rate cut in the next year the federal reserve has voiced a preference to remain on hold until more pronounced inflation emerges in europe the last three weeks brought no change to the implied policy rate holding steady at 4bps over the next one year forward market implied policy rates source bloomberg epb macro research asset prices globally are converging to the idea that global growth has bottomed and central banks averted another recession while risk assets have fully made that decision treasury bonds are roughly balanced to the idea of a further slowdown or a re acceleration in growth as we will see in the next section economic data while less bad on the margin has not accelerated with sufficient magnitude or with sufficient breadth across many sectors and reports to have confidence in a sustained upturn just yet the rise in leading indicators may become more pronounced and widespread offering hope that coincident economic data would trough sometime in q1 it is equally possible however to see leading data rollover and push a potential us recovery further out in 2020 risk assets have made a decision if leading indicators rise risk assets would have correctly discounted the stabilization should leading indicators disappoint over the next several weeks markets may be carrying more economic cycle risk than is currently appreciated by the consensus rather than guessing on which way the leading indicators break the highest conviction can only be had once an inflection is spread across market data soft data and hard data and in a logical economic sequence q1 of 2019 was a period that came with many bullish market signals but lacked confirmation across economic data the slowdown continued and intensified defying the market signals through the balance of 2019 interest rate trends treasury rates ended the week down a few basis points across most parts of the curve after much volatility weekly change in treasury yields source bloomberg epb macro research over the past month the yield curve has flattened with all yields falling and long term yields falling most significantly monthly change in treasury yields source bloomberg epb macro research over the past month aided by another dovish fomc press conference the decline in yields has can be entirely attributed to the real interest rate as compared to inflation expectations monthly change in treasury yields breakdown source bloomberg epb macro research the same story can be seen over the past six months yields have dropped across the curve over the past six months mainly due to the real interest rate six month change in treasury yields breakdown source bloomberg epb macro research the yield curve has uninverted since the low point in august but has flattened over the past several weeks as noted above 10 year rate minus 3 month rate source bloomberg epb macro research 2 year treasury rates much less sensitive to inflation expectations and more tethered to fed policy as compared to 30 year rates have not moved meaningfully higher 2 year treasury rate source bloomberg epb macro research the backup in yields is coming mainly from longer term inflation expectations with leading indicators of inflation partially stabilizing a precipitous decline in inflation expectations may no longer aid a rally in long term bonds 30 year treasury rate source bloomberg epb macro research it remains possible pending the next several months of leading data for real interest rates to still carry nominal yields to new lows corporate spreads corporate credit continued to rally across the spectrum with investment grade and high yield bond spreads tightening over the past month monthly change in corporate yield spreads source bloomberg epb macro research over the past six months credit spreads have tightened across every quality except ccc rated debt six month change in corporate yield spreads source bloomberg epb macro research bbb rated corporate spreads have compressed notably breaking down near the cyclical inflection point from january 2018 us corporate bbb grade option adjusted spread source bloomberg epb macro research the recent rally in credit was shared across all qualities b rated high yield bond spreads fell sharply us corporate b grade option adjusted spread source bloomberg epb macro research ccc rated bond spreads are the only area of the credit spectrum that continues to show a trend of widening us corporate ccc grade option adjusted spread source bloomberg epb macro research the quality spread the difference between bbb spreads and a spreads also broke down below the lower end of the range set over the past eight months quality spread bbb oas a oas source bloomberg epb macro research with the exception of ccc rated debt the credit market is sending bullish signals as spreads continue to compress falling near the cycle lows inflationary trends commodity trends after reaching a cyclical peak in the middle of 2018 inflation has been cycling lower for the last 18 months while some leading indicators of inflation have stabilized a cyclical upturn in inflation seems premature 5 year breakeven inflation rate source bloomberg epb macro research both 5 year and 30 year breakeven inflation rates have returned to the high end of the downtrend that has been in place since the middle of 2018 30 year breakeven inflation rate source bloomberg epb macro research interestingly the 30 year yield reached a new all time low in 2019 but the 10 year yield did not the 30 year yield made a new low with inflation expectations chart above that were marginally above the 2016 low it was the 30 year real yield that made a significantly lower low relative to the 2016 downturn 30 year real rates have started to roll back towards the cyclical low as the federal reserve signaled the desire to keep rates lower for longer the market is pricing in lower structural growth and a lower long run fed funds rate with a 30 year real rate that struggles to move materially above the most recent cyclical low 30 year real interest rate source bloomberg epb macro research more or less the inverse of real interest rates gold is marginally off the most recent high after a strong multi month rally gold is becoming increasingly attractive as the fed takes a stand and sets a high bar for future rate hikes leading inflation data is showing signs of stability the combination of accelerating inflation data with an easier fed is a strong recipe for lower real rates it is too early to call for a cyclical upturn in inflation but this possibility exists gold source bloomberg epb macro research oil is helping keep inflation expectations elevated as crude pushed above 60 crude oil source bloomberg epb macro research industrial materials have made a significant move higher in the past several days a similar move higher was seen in january 2019 which ultimately reversed before a sustained cyclical upturn industrial materials spot index source bloomberg epb macro research in growth rate terms the price of industrial materials has started to rise this is a noteworthy change but not a confirmation of a new upturn several rises in the growth rate can be seen over the past two years industrial materials spot index growth rate source bloomberg epb macro research should the growth rate of industrial materials push above 0 and move into positive territory along with a move lower in the usd and broader confirmation from other data we would then back away from a heavy concentration in more deflation sensitive exposures us dollar trends the usd has started to soften after a multi month bullish trend with a combination of easier monetary policy balance sheet expansion and cyclical green shoots in europe the dollar has eased off its cyclical peak bloomberg dollar spot index source bloomberg epb macro research the trade weighted usd basket remains in a much stronger trend relative to the bloomberg dollar index chart above which mainly consists of major currencies such as the euro yen canadian dollar and british pound broad trade weighted usd source bloomberg epb macro research asian emerging market currencies broadly have continued to strengthen a sign that global conditions are starting to stabilize emerging market currency basket source bloomberg epb macro research watching the dollar against both major currencies and em currencies will hold valuable insight regarding global growth divergences and the extent of disinflationary pressure that accompanies a strong currency monetary credit trends broad money growth m2 ticked down slightly to 7 2 after rising sharply in the back half of the year money supply growth m2 source bloomberg epb macro research narrow money growth m1 also ticked lower falling to a rate of 5 4 money supply growth m1 source bloomberg epb macro research if we look at true money supply or tms a popular measure that adjusts for traveler s checks time deposits money market funds and treasury deposits held at the fed the increase is significantly less but improving tms historically has held a much stronger correlation to global and domestic economic growth compared to regular m1 and m2 the chart clearly shows tms as a leading indicator troughing before recessionary periods a rise in money growth today does not imply strong growth or asset price performance in the immediate term us true money supply growth tms source bloomberg epb macro research total loan growth continues to soften falling to a rate of 4 74 total loan growth source federal reserve epb macro research while the growth rate of total loans is holding flat to down the mix of loans is shifting real estate loan growth commercial industrial loan growth source federal reserve epb macro research banks are clearly moving away from c i loans in favor of real estate loans commercial real estate loan growth source federal reserve epb macro research commercial real estate loan growth rose massively in the past several weeks while c i loan growth has plunged summary outlook over the past six toeight weeks the rate of decline in global growth has moderated and the weighted beta of the portfolio has moved slightly higher to respect the improved conditions currently it is premature to declare a cyclical upturn in either inflation or growth despite the stabilization across a handful of data points post yield curve inversion and with coincident economic data sliding to the weakest growth rate of this economic cycle coupled with extreme secular risk asset valuations the case for a defensive allocation remains strong rather than looking at the nominal weightings of the portfolio it can be useful to think about a portfolio allocation in terms of the allocation of risk or volatility if your benchmark portfolio or your baseline portfolio is a 60 40 portfolio that allocation carries about 80 risk in stocks today s trending direction in growth lower and inflation lower with extreme valuation risk and remaining recession risk would argue for reduced exposure to stocks relative to the 80 risk benchmark the extent to which you underweight overweight risk relative to your benchmark has a high degree of personal preference the model portfolio always seeks to overweight risk towards the assets that are likely to have above average risk adjusted returns during the given environment of growth and inflation within a framework of a balanced low volatility portfolio i will cover some of these topics in more detail in the q1 quarterly webcast
many people have the impression that recessions come from financial missteps such as the us subprime loan fiasco if energy is involved at all the problem comes from high oil prices as supply becomes inadequate to meet demand the real situation is different we already seem to be on the road toward a new crisis this crisis is likely to be much worse than the great recession of 2008 2009 this time a major problem is likely to be energy prices that are too low for producers last time a major problem was oil prices that were too high for consumers the problem is different but it is in some ways symmetric last time the united states seemed to be the epicenter this time my analysis indicates china is likely to be the epicenter last time the world economy was coming off a high growth period this time the world economy is already somewhat depressed even before hitting headwinds these differences plus the strange physics based way that the world economy is organized explain why the outcome seems likely to be worse this time than in 2008 2009 i recently explained what i see as happening in a presentation for actuaries recession likely expect a bend in trend lines this post is based on this presentation omitting the strictly insurance related portions the big thing that the vast majority of people do not understand is how important energy is to the economy because of this issue i started my presentation with this slide slide 3 after an opportunity for discussion i offered the explanation that the role of food for humans is very much parallel to the need for energy of various types for the world economy food provides people with the energy required if they are to have the ability to think move and speak energy products of many kinds enable the activities that we associate with gdp for example energy consumption enables machinery to operate and goods to be transported slide 4 larger image at this link using data from smil as well as more recent bp data we can estimate how fast energy consumption has been growing over a very long period nearly 200 years we can see that the highest energy consumption growth occurred in the 1961 to 1970 period the second highest growth occurred in the 1951 to 1960 period these are periods we associate with rapid gdp growth and prosperity on the next slide i show the same data displayed in a different way slide 5 larger image at this link on this slide i make two changes in the way the data are displayed note that when population growth corresponds to the full amount of energy consumption growth in other words at times when there is no red area above the blue area energy consumption per capita is flat high growth in energy consumption per capita seems to correspond to rising living standards as occurred in the 1950s and 1960s while i label the all other category as if it is simply changes in living standards there are other components as well one breakdown might be the following efficiency improvements item 4 will allow more energy to be available for improvement in living standards while items 2 and 3 in the above list act in the opposite direction we do not know to what extent these items really offset each other thus all other improvement in living standards is only a rough approximation slide 6 larger image at this link we can see from slide 6 that whenever there is no red area above the blue area flat living standards or flat energy per capita adverse events seem to happen for example the us civil war 1861 1865 came at a time of low energy consumption growth the great depression of the 1930s came during another period of low energy consumption per capita growth world war i came at the beginning of this period and world war ii came at the end the collapse of the central government of the soviet union in 1991 ushered in a decade of low world energy consumption growth in part because of the loss of the central currency of the soviet union the china coal note at the end pertains to the way that china and its coal supply has helped pull the world economy forward since 2001 this benefit seems to be already declining slide 7 larger image at this link slide 7 shows china s energy production by fuel coal production in red soared after china was added to the world trade organization in december 2001 beginning about 2012 china s coal production began to plateau depleting mines and low prices for coal have kept production flat imports can be used as substitutes to some extent but it is difficult to keep costs low enough and provide adequate total supply with the loss of growth in china s coal production its economy has had to cut back each year we read about coal mine closures and miners needing to find new jobs we know that china discontinued its paper and plastic recycling business as of january 1 2018 china has also been cutting back on solar subsidies leading to fewer jobs installing solar panels all of these types of changes reduce the number of people who can afford to buy high priced goods such as new homes vehicles and smart phones slide 8 larger image at this link it is becoming increasingly clear that china is being forced to cut back on heavy industrialization because of its coal difficulties slide 8 shows automobile purchases for six large economies china is by far the largest of these economies in terms of auto sales china s auto sales began to slide in 2018 and are sliding further in 2019 about 11 if we look back at the time of the 2008 2009 recession we see that auto sales of the us dropped precipitously the united states was the country that led the world into recession the inability of us citizens to buy cars was a sign that something was seriously wrong now we are seeing a similar pattern in china china has reported that its gdp growth rate has been slightly lower during 2019 but we really don t know how much lower the amounts it publishes are too smooth to be believed the actual gdp growth rate is believed to be lower than the recently reported 6 0 but no one knows by precisely how much figure 8b cnbc chart of changes in auto sales by country based on data through october 2019 not part of original presentation source figure 8b gives a little more information about recent car sales by country we can see from this chart that based on data through october 2019 world automobile sales are expected to fall by about the same percentage 3 in 2019 as during the recession year of 2008 i find this disturbing we can also see the huge impact that china has had on keeping world private passenger auto sales rising the world economy looked like it was headed into recession in january 2016 when world oil prices were very low but a spike in china s automobile sales at that time helped keep total world automobile sales rising and allowed world oil prices to rise from their low point in the next sections i provide some background regarding this story slide 9 slide 10 larger image at this link slide 10 shows the way that i visualize the world economy self organizing and growing the economy grows by adding new layers of businesses products consumers and laws unneeded products such as buggy whips are dropped from the bottom unprofitable businesses close in some sense the economy is hollow because of these deletions it cannot easily go backward because for example the support services for widespread use of transport using horses are lacking energy is used to operate all aspects of the system one part of the system is a self organizing financial system that helps decide through wage levels who gets the benefit of the goods and services that are made this financial system includes self organizing interest rates and self organizing commodity prices the most important connection within the economy is the one i show at the center as consumers employees consumers are very dependent on their wages as employees if the economy is to continue to operate workers must receive high enough wages to purchase the goods and services the economy produces even the lower paid workers need to be able to afford food housing and transportation or the economy will tend to collapse slide 11 when we look back through the history on slides 4 5 and 6 we see that the growth of energy consumption is very important in how economies operate the theories of ilya prigogine explain why this is the case when adequate flows of energy are available self organizing systems are able to grow few economists today include energy consumption in their models however economic theory has grown over time in its own ivory tower like other academic subjects it depends on early theories and the process of peer review the views expressed must also be pleasing to those in power who would like everyone to believe that politicians rather than the laws of physics are in charge slide 12 there are many types of self organizing systems that grow they all directly or indirectly require energy plants and animals of all types are self organizing systems that grow hurricanes grow using the energy that they get from warm water governments grow from the tax revenue that they are able to collect they use the revenue to buy energy products such as electricity to operate governmental offices oil to build roads and operate police cars and natural gas to heat buildings the internet grows through the revenue collected to provide its services the internet uses revenue to buy computers made with energy products and electricity to operate those computers slice 13 nearly all 0f the energy we use is hidden for example modern food production is very much dependent on energy consumption agricultural machines are made using energy products soil amendments including organic soil amendments are transported using fossil fuel energy refrigeration is possible through the use of energy hybrid seeds are only possible through energy consumption planting seeds by digging with a stick would only use human energy but such a process would be terribly inefficient slide 14 slide 15 most of us can easily recognize today s goods and services such as those listed slide 16 promises of future goods and services act like promises of future energy supplies this happens because creating goods and services that people can actually use requires energy supplies of the appropriate type when people get cash or a check they expect to use it to buy goods and services creating these goods and services requires energy consumption if there is no energy of the right type available the goods and services won t be available to fulfill the promises slide 17 larger image at this link promises of future goods and services tend to grow faster than actual goods and services because it is these promises that in some sense pull the economy along for example if a young person gets a loan s he can often buy a new car the fact that a new car is being purchased leads to more jobs in the supply line leading up to new car production or if a business takes out a loan or sells shares of stock it can use the proceeds to hire employees it is these growing wages that keep the system operating as long as the economy is growing rapidly the mismatch between growing debt and actual output doesn t become apparent as the economy slows some workers find themselves working fewer hours some businesses become less profitable and lay off workers to try to restore profitability the catch is with fewer workers the economy slows even more it usually takes more debt at lower interest rates to get out of such an economic slowdown slide 18 slide 19 there is a lot of confusion about prices demand is what people through their wages and debt can afford as economists tell us price depends on supply and demand in the short term prices tend to bounce around a lot the short term buyers of oil are oil refineries they need to keep their employees busy if they see a shortage of oil they may bid up the price of oil to allow their workers to continue to be employed over the longer term prices of all energy products tend to depend on consumers ability to afford finished products like cars homes and cell phones producing these objects and shipping them takes energy they also use energy as they operate slide 20 larger image at this link the various energy prices shown here are simply a few of the many many energy prices that we see around the world strangely enough prices of all energy products tend to fluctuate together over the longer term prices depend on affordability of end products such as cars homes computers food and clothing our problem since about 2012 has been lack of affordability of end products the primary way of raising affordability is by increasing productivity increased productivity is made possible by increasingly leveraging human labor with devices that are built with energy and are operated using energy for example a worker with a ditch digging machine is much more productive than a ditch digger with only a shovel an analyst is more productive with a computer and internet access than with only pencil and paper with higher productivity more goods are produced in total as long as not too much of this productive output is skimmed off the top by governments or by business hierarchy or to pay for the devices and their fuel it is possible for each worker to afford more goods and services raising total demand an alternative way of raising affordability is by adding more debt at ever lower interest rates this approach tends to make goods such as cars homes and factories appear more affordable because their monthly payments are lower this added debt approach only works as long as the economy is growing quickly enough if the economy slows too much the added debt leads to financial crashes of many types slide 21 slide 22 many people think that they know the amount of oil that can be extracted based on the current technology and the assumption that prices will eventually rise high enough to extract all of the fossil fuels that seem to be available for example the international energy agency has prepared reports in which it shows expected oil availability if oil prices rise to 300 per barrel the catch is that even if oil prices can bounce high it is not clear that they can stay very high the current price of oil is only in the 55 to 65 per barrel range a price of 300 per barrel will allow oil extraction using very advanced technology we don t have any evidence that oil prices can stay this high because demand comes primarily from wages prices cannot stay high without adequate support from wage levels of course the issue is not just oil prices staying sufficiently high natural gas coal uranium and electricity prices all have difficulty rising high enough and staying high enough commodity prices such as copper and steel have the same issue slide 23 there are many people who say of course oil prices will rise oil is a necessity they forget that it is really a two way tug of war between producers getting a high enough price to be profitable and consumers getting a low enough price to be affordable there will be a winner and a loser people also forget that most commodity use is hidden we see the fuel we buy for our personal vehicles but there are a huge quantity of oil products required for shipping goods paving roads growing food and for many other uses that we are not aware of while we might be able to pay a little more to fill our gasoline tank most of us would not be able to simultaneously pay more for food transported goods of all kinds and road maintenance slide 24 larger image at this link economists often assume that if energy prices rise wages will rise as well if we look at the data historically however it doesn t work that way at all what happens is the opposite average wages tend to rise as long as oil prices stay low once oil prices spike average wages tend to flatten out the amounts shown on slide 24 are average wages computed by taking the total inflation adjusted wages for the population in total and dividing by population when oil prices spike recession soon sets in the reason why average wages fall is partly because more people become unemployed other workers find it necessary to accept lower paying jobs slide 25 larger image at this link many people focus on the run up in oil prices to july 2008 an equally important point is the fact that the world economy has not been able to maintain these high prices since july 2008 the general price trend has been downward the cuts by opec have not had a material impact slide 26 citizens of the united states europe and japan are used to thinking of high energy prices as being a problem because they are from countries that require substantial imported energy to maintain their gdp for example greece will sell fewer trips on its tour boats if oil prices are high this will have an adverse impact on employment and the ability to repay debt with interest if a country is an oil exporting country low oil prices are an even worse problem this happens because oil exporting countries tend to earn a large share of their revenue from taxes on the sale of oil these taxes can be much higher if oil is selling for say 120 per barrel than if it is selling for 60 per barrel these tax dollars are used to provide subsidies to offset the high cost of imported food they are also used to build industry and infrastructure to provide employment to the population if oil prices are too low oil exporting countries will tend to cut back on oil production in fact this has been happening for opec for the entire year of 2019 similar problems occur if commodity prices of any kind coal natural gas uranium steel copper etc stay too low for an extended period producers go bankrupt or they stop production or they pay their employees so poorly that the employees go on strike sometimes they may even start rioting many of the riots around the world today are related to low commodity prices slide 27 slide 28 larger image at this link the world experienced spiking oil prices in the period leading up to mid 2008 these high prices caused a recession and much lower prices followed the chart on slide 28 gives a somewhat exaggerated our finite world

growth occurred in the 1951 to 1960 period these are periods we associate with rapid gdp growth and prosperity on the next slide i show the same data displayed in a different way slide 5 larger image at this link on this slide i make two changes in the way the data are displayed note that when population growth corresponds to the full amount of energy consumption growth in other words at times when there is no red area above the blue area energy consumption per capita is flat high growth in energy consumption per capita seems to correspond to rising living standards as occurred in the 1950s and 1960s while i label the all other category as if it is simply changes in living standards there are other components as well one breakdown might be the following efficiency improvements item 4 will allow more energy to be available for improvement in living standards while items 2 and 3 in the above list act in the opposite direction we do not know to what extent these items really offset each other thus all other improvement in living standards is only a rough approximation slide 6 larger image at this link we can see from slide 6 that whenever there is no red area above the blue area flat living standards or flat energy per capita adverse events seem to happen for example the us civil war 1861 1865 came at a time of low energy consumption growth the great depression of the 1930s came during another period of low energy consumption per capita growth world war i came at the beginning of this period and world war ii came at the end the collapse of the central government of the soviet union in 1991 ushered in a decade of low world energy consumption growth in part because of the loss of the central currency of the soviet union the china coal note at the end pertains to the way that china and its coal supply has helped pull the world economy forward since 2001 this benefit seems to be already declining slide 7 larger image at this link slide 7 shows china s energy production by fuel coal production in red soared after china was added to the world trade organization in december 2001 beginning about 2012 china s coal production began to plateau depleting mines and low prices for coal have kept production flat imports can be used as substitutes to some extent but it is difficult to keep costs low enough and provide adequate total supply with the loss of growth in china s coal production its economy has had to cut back each year we read about coal mine closures and miners needing to find new jobs we know that china discontinued its paper and plastic recycling business as of january 1 2018 china has also been cutting back on solar subsidies leading to fewer jobs installing solar panels all of these types of changes reduce the number of people who can afford to buy high priced goods such as new homes vehicles and smart phones slide 8 larger image at this link it is becoming increasingly clear that china is being forced to cut back on heavy industrialization because of its coal difficulties slide 8 shows automobile purchases for six large economies china is by far the largest of these economies in terms of auto sales china s auto sales began to slide in 2018 and are sliding further in 2019 about 11 if we look back at the time of the 2008 2009 recession we see that auto sales of the us dropped precipitously the united states was the country that led the world into recession the inability of us citizens to buy cars was a sign that something was seriously wrong now we are seeing a similar pattern in china china has reported that its gdp growth rate has been slightly lower during 2019 but we really don t know how much lower the amounts it publishes are too smooth to be believed the actual gdp growth rate is believed to be lower than the recently reported 6 0 but no one knows by precisely how much figure 8b cnbc chart of changes in auto sales by country based on data through october 2019 not part of original presentation source figure 8b gives a little more information about recent car sales by country we can see from this chart that based on data through october 2019 world automobile sales are expected to fall by about the same percentage 3 in 2019 as during the recession year of 2008 i find this disturbing we can also see the huge impact that china has had on keeping world private passenger auto sales rising the world economy looked like it was headed into recession in january 2016 when world oil prices were very low but a spike in china s automobile sales at that time helped keep total world automobile sales rising and allowed world oil prices to rise from their low point in the next sections i provide some background regarding this story slide 9 slide 10 larger image at this link slide 10 shows the way that i visualize the world economy self organizing and growing the economy grows by adding new layers of businesses products consumers and laws unneeded products such as buggy whips are dropped from the bottom unprofitable businesses close in some sense the economy is hollow because of these deletions it cannot easily go backward because for example the support services for widespread use of transport using horses are lacking energy is used to operate all aspects of the system one part of the system is a self organizing financial system that helps decide through wage levels who gets the benefit of the goods and services that are made this financial system includes self organizing interest rates and self organizing commodity prices the most important connection within the economy is the one i show at the center as consumers employees consumers are very dependent on their wages as employees if the economy is to continue to operate workers must receive high enough wages to purchase the goods and services the economy produces even the lower paid workers need to be able to afford food housing and transportation or the economy will tend to collapse slide 11 when we look back through the history on slides 4 5 and 6 we see that the growth of energy consumption is very important in how economies operate the theories of ilya prigogine explain why this is the case when adequate flows of energy are available self organizing systems are able to grow few economists today include energy consumption in their models however economic theory has grown over time in its own ivory tower like other academic subjects it depends on early theories and the process of peer review the views expressed must also be pleasing to those in power who would like everyone to believe that politicians rather than the laws of physics are in charge slide 12 there are many types of self organizing systems that grow they all directly or indirectly require energy plants and animals of all types are self organizing systems that grow hurricanes grow using the energy that they get from warm water governments grow from the tax revenue that they are able to collect they use the revenue to buy energy products such as electricity to operate governmental offices oil to build roads and operate police cars and natural gas to heat buildings the internet grows through the revenue collected to provide its services the internet uses revenue to buy computers made with energy products and electricity to operate those computers slice 13 nearly all 0f the energy we use is hidden for example modern food production is very much dependent on energy consumption agricultural machines are made using energy products soil amendments including organic soil amendments are transported using fossil fuel energy refrigeration is possible through the use of energy hybrid seeds are only possible through energy consumption planting seeds by digging with a stick would only use human energy but such a process would be terribly inefficient slide 14 slide 15 most of us can easily recognize today s goods and services such as those listed slide 16 promises of future goods and services act like promises of future energy supplies this happens because creating goods and services that people can actually use requires energy supplies of the appropriate type when people get cash or a check they expect to use it to buy goods and services creating these goods and services requires energy consumption if there is no energy of the right type available the goods and services won t be available to fulfill the promises slide 17 larger image at this link promises of future goods and services tend to grow faster than actual goods and services because it is these promises that in some sense pull the economy along for example if a young person gets a loan s he can often buy a new car the fact that a new car is being purchased leads to more jobs in the supply line leading up to new car production or if a business takes out a loan or sells shares of stock it can use the proceeds to hire employees it is these growing wages that keep the system operating as long as the economy is growing rapidly the mismatch between growing debt and actual output doesn t become apparent as the economy slows some workers find themselves working fewer hours some businesses become less profitable and lay off workers to try to restore profitability the catch is with fewer workers the economy slows even more it usually takes more debt at lower interest rates to get out of such an economic slowdown slide 18 slide 19 there is a lot of confusion about prices demand is what people through their wages and debt can afford as economists tell us price depends on supply and demand in the short term prices tend to bounce around a lot the short term buyers of oil are oil refineries they need to keep their employees busy if they see a shortage of oil they may bid up the price of oil to allow their workers to continue to be employed over the longer term prices of all energy products tend to depend on consumers ability to afford finished products like cars homes and cell phones producing these objects and shipping them takes energy they also use energy as they operate slide 20 larger image at this link the various energy prices shown here are simply a few of the many many energy prices that we see around the world strangely enough prices of all energy products tend to fluctuate together over the longer term prices depend on affordability of end products such as cars homes computers food and clothing our problem since about 2012 has been lack of affordability of end products the primary way of raising affordability is by increasing productivity increased productivity is made possible by increasingly leveraging human labor with devices that are built with energy and are operated using energy for example a worker with a ditch digging machine is much more productive than a ditch digger with only a shovel an analyst is more productive with a computer and internet access than with only pencil and paper with higher productivity more goods are produced in total as long as not too much of this productive output is skimmed off the top by governments or by business hierarchy or to pay for the devices and their fuel it is possible for each worker to afford more goods and services raising total demand an alternative way of raising affordability is by adding more debt at ever lower interest rates this approach tends to make goods such as cars homes and factories appear more affordable because their monthly payments are lower this added debt approach only works as long as the economy is growing quickly enough if the economy slows too much the added debt leads to financial crashes of many types slide 21 slide 22 many people think that they know the amount of oil that can be extracted based on the current technology and the assumption that prices will eventually rise high enough to extract all of the fossil fuels that seem to be available for example the international energy agency has prepared reports in which it shows expected oil availability if oil prices rise to 300 per barrel the catch is that even if oil prices can bounce high it is not clear that they can stay very high the current price of oil is only in the 55 to 65 per barrel range a price of 300 per barrel will allow oil extraction using very advanced technology we don t have any evidence that oil prices can stay this high because demand comes primarily from wages prices cannot stay high without adequate support from wage levels of course the issue is not just oil prices staying sufficiently high natural gas coal uranium and electricity prices all have difficulty rising high enough and staying high enough commodity prices such as copper and steel have the same issue slide 23 there are many people who say of course oil prices will rise oil is a necessity they forget that it is really a two way tug of war between producers getting a high enough price to be profitable and consumers getting a low enough price to be affordable there will be a winner and a loser people also forget that most commodity use is hidden we see the fuel we buy for our personal vehicles but there are a huge quantity of oil products required for shipping goods paving roads growing food and for many other uses that we are not aware of while we might be able to pay a little more to fill our gasoline tank most of us would not be able to simultaneously pay more for food transported goods of all kinds and road maintenance slide 24 larger image at this link economists often assume that if energy prices rise wages will rise as well if we look at the data historically however it doesn t work that way at all what happens is the opposite average wages tend to rise as long as oil prices stay low once oil prices spike average wages tend to flatten out the amounts shown on slide 24 are average wages computed by taking the total inflation adjusted wages for the population in total and dividing by population when oil prices spike recession soon sets in the reason why average wages fall is partly because more people become unemployed other workers find it necessary to accept lower paying jobs slide 25 larger image at this link many people focus on the run up in oil prices to july 2008 an equally important point is the fact that the world economy has not been able to maintain these high prices since july 2008 the general price trend has been downward the cuts by opec have not had a material impact slide 26 citizens of the united states europe and japan are used to thinking of high energy prices as being a problem because they are from countries that require substantial imported energy to maintain their gdp for example greece will sell fewer trips on its tour boats if oil prices are high this will have an adverse impact on employment and the ability to repay debt with interest if a country is an oil exporting country low oil prices are an even worse problem this happens because oil exporting countries tend to earn a large share of their revenue from taxes on the sale of oil these taxes can be much higher if oil is selling for say 120 per barrel than if it is selling for 60 per barrel these tax dollars are used to provide subsidies to offset the high cost of imported food they are also used to build industry and infrastructure to provide employment to the population if oil prices are too low oil exporting countries will tend to cut back on oil production in fact this has been happening for opec for the entire year of 2019 similar problems occur if commodity prices of any kind coal natural gas uranium steel copper etc stay too low for an extended period producers go bankrupt or they stop production or they pay their employees so poorly that the employees go on strike sometimes they may even start rioting many of the riots around the world today are related to low commodity prices slide 27 slide 28 larger image at this link the world experienced spiking oil prices in the period leading up to mid 2008 these high prices caused a recession and much lower prices followed the chart on slide 28 gives a somewhat exaggerated our finite world
fiat s failings gold and blockchains goldmoney follow published in goldmoney 14 min read dec 5 2019 listen share by alasdair macleod the world stands on the edge of a cyclical downturn exacerbated by trade tariffs initiated by america we know what will happen the major central banks will attempt to inflate their way out of the consequences and those of us with an elementary grasp of economics should know why the policy will fail in addition to the monetary and debt inflation since the lehman crisis it is highly likely the major international currencies will suffer a catastrophic loss of purchasing power from a new round of monetary expansion calling for a replacement of today s fiat currency system with something more stable the ultimate solution unlikely to be adopted is to reinstate gold as circulating money and how gold works as money is outlined in this article instead central banks will struggle for fiat based solutions which are bound to face a similar fate with or without the blockchain technology being actively considered the asian and brics blocs have an opportunity to do something with gold but will they take it introduction central banks around the world are praying that there won t be a recession and if there is that a further monetary stimulus will ensure economic recovery their problem is keynesian theory says it will work but last time it didn t in fact it has never worked beyond a temporary basis the big surprise this time was the lack of officially recorded price inflation but this is due to the system gaming the numbers making it appear there has been some moderate growth when a proper deflator would confirm most western economies have been contracting in real terms for the last ten years most likely the monetary planners believe their own numbers that being the case any softening in an economy will be deemed to require yet more aggressive monetary expansion than that which followed the lehman crisis the ecb is even talking about creating money to invest in renewable energy as well as funding budget deficits jay powell is giving the fed some leeway on the potential for price inflation the anticipated consequence of revved up monetary inflation to deal with upcoming challenges to encourage governments to increase their budget deficits to give yet more keynesian stimulus quantitative easing will give them the means while at the same time recapitalising the banks but with things not working as the textbooks said they should many monetary planners are highly concerned speculating some sort of monetary reset will eventually be required classical economics is very clear on the matter the wealth transfer of the cantillon effect is permanently impoverishing the majority of producers and temporally enriching governments banks large zombie corporations and speculators businesses that should not see the light of day obtain easy money no one expects to have to repay debt which around the world is now estimated to be 255 trillion up over 45 since lehman s failure and they know it will be reduced in real terms by inflation we are past the point where monetary stimulation creates a temporary economic benevolence which according to keynes is all that s required to revive animal spirits but the animal in us all is suffering severe monetary anaemia having been bled to near death over repetitive cycles of credit inflation we know the planners are worried about loss of control it is reported that seven out of ten central banks are examining cryptocurrency and blockchain solutions the bank for international settlements probably hosts an unofficial committee to coordinate ideas and identify significant issues a blockchain might allow a central bank to monitor and direct ownership of money as a means of complimenting their monopoly of the supply and transfer of benefits between savers and borrowers it threatens to take the socialisation of money to a new level and offers the prospect of increasing statist control over its use this article attempts to provide context for the dilemmas faced by a failing fiat money system the error at the outset is to think that money is a creature of the state the state can legislate as much as it likes but ultimately any socialising monetary system fails if in their lack of wisdom central banks mistakenly replace one form of fiat with another then they will merely be issuing a new mandat to replace a failed assignat the mistake that france s revolutionary parliament made in the turbulent 1789 96 period in that sense the world is where france was in the early 1790s a period that led to civil insurrection napoleon and european wide wars that was bad enough but on a global scale mistakes in establishing a future form of money are potentially far more dangerous for mankind defining money it is time to properly define money and its function to provide a baseline for critics of socialising states in order to comprehend the errors that are likely to be committed in the replacement of failing currencies it is no exaggeration to accuse monetary planners of misconceptions and ignorance about their own subject the only form of money which they believe is acceptable is the fiat money of their own issuance but the population does not use it of its own free will having been forced to by being stealthily robbed of sound money over decades in order to use state issued fiat until it has become fully accepted through habit fiat money satisfies only some of the conditions of sound money but its flaws in the other conditions are the reason for its eventual downfall here is a summer of those conditions it must be the most commonly used medium of exchange in a market society it is the most marketable good whose primary purpose is to be later exchanged for the goods and services its users need and desire it must be readily accepted for goods services and the satisfaction of debts it must facilitate the division of labour upon which all economic progress is based its quantity and purchasing power can only be decided collectively by its users acting as individuals the role of the state and the banks must be strictly limited to providing fully backed money substitutes it must be widely accepted across national borders in order to be truly credible as long as these criteria are satisfied anything can act as money sound money can only be commodity money such as gold and silver or gold and silver substitutes respectively which are fully backed by bullion other forms which do not satisfy all the listed conditions but can circulate for a temporary period include token money where a coin takes its value from its face value and not its commodity value credit money which is not redeemable into gold on demand fiat money in its various forms and more recently cryptocurrencies as well as any other forms of money yet to be invented it stands to reason that a form of money that evolves from the people s choice instead of one imposed upon them by their governments through legislation will be more durable decentralised ledger cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin offers this advantage gold the longest lasting form of money has been used for millennia and accepted as having value as money across diverse civilisations it has only been displaced by fiat money through the evolution of discriminatory legislation in the last century fiat money evolved from masquerading as a money substitute even during the gold standards of the nineteenth century banks issued money in the form of credit simply by creating it without the backing of gold consequently gold substitutes and fiat currency circulated with no means for the public to distinguish the fiat element from gold substitutes the inability of anyone to tell the difference has been exploited by governments throughout history leading more recently to the last fig leaf of gold substitution being reneged on altogether in 1971 the current monetary crisis has come about through the unfettered inflation of supply by governments and their central banks taking full advantage of their seigniorage monopoly the gold standard for a new money any monetary reform designed to last must dispense with the temptation of utilising seigniorage as a means of funding by the state this condition makes it impossible for spendthrift governments to consider any monetary reform that embraces sound money unless they are able to reform their role in their economies as well furthermore they have to overcome the misdirection of what they believe to be the path to economic progress falsely termed as growth but is in fact monetary inflation the combination of statistical mathematical and keynesian economics which have been taught and evolved from fallacies for at least a century is barely more sophisticated than john law s experiment which bankrupted france three hundred years ago nothing less than the re adoption of gold always the people s preferred choice for their money will survive both space and time gold substitutes are not only permissible but desirable because no one will want the inconvenience of weighing gold and testing for its purity in order to settle a transaction both cash and electronic settlements must be fully backed by physical gold and deferred settlements contracted in gold or gold substitutes banking must be realigned separately into acting as deposit banks as custodians and acting as arrangers of finance as intermediaries to rid the system of unbacked bank credit and all fiat masquerading as gold substitutes must be legislated to be fraudulent there are many prizes for an economy that uses gold and fully backed gold substitutes as its medium of exchange giving certainty on the money side to everyone trade imbalances disappear and the general level of prices is regulated by gold arbitrage between centres thus if it is generally cheaper for citizens in parsimonia to buy goods from ruritania parsimonian gold or gold substitutes will move to ruritania as payment for goods the increased quantity of gold relative to demand for goods in ruritania will raise the general level of prices there while the lower stock of gold resulting in parsimonia will lower its domestic price level until they coincide with those of ruritania allowing of course for frictional costs where there are different relative preferences between money gold and goods prices will tend to balance out through the arbitrage process this does not happen with national currencies which are not gold substitutes any trade arbitrageur is faced with the additional step of selling one currency and buying another furthermore governments use the cover of gold substitution to intervene in currency markets by deploying unbacked fiat as evidenced in the days of the bretton woods agreement a further benefit comes from the necessary realignment of government activities when gold and gold substitutes are money governments can no longer finance themselves through the expansion of bank credit nor can they socialise money except to an extent strictly limited by taxes consequently producers in which we include ordinary working men and women as well as organised businesses have greater certainty over the value of their earnings profits and future values and with the state taking a lesser role in welfare provision the strictures that come with increased personal responsibility encourage saving the cycle of credit expansion speculation and crisis simply disappears in the absence of bank credit periodically expanded without gold backing capital is invested with the greatest efficiency failures being cut quickly so that all forms of productive capital can be redirected into more successful enterprises and ventures measured in gold and gold substitutes prices decline over time through product innovation technologies and competition instead of relying on currency debasement to reduce the burden of debt a borrower knows that it is in his interest to repay his debts at the earliest opportunity and the saver knows that his savings will not be depreciated over time this is a brief summary of the best replacement for failing fiat currencies which is gold and its fully backed substitutes it is strongly disliked by modern states because it hands monetary power to the people depriving governments of the ability to regulate money and credit while benefiting from its seigniorage its introduction cuts off a source of wealth transfer upon which the state has become accustomed to depend the reintroduction of gold as money means welfare payments have to be curtailed and future welfare commitments withdrawn sound money is not an electable proposition it is likely that a monetary reset will not be aimed at the adoption of sound money in an incorruptible form to replace a failed monetary system if only because it would require a negation of all socialising economics but there could be a difference in approach between nations whose leaders understand the basics of sound money and those who do not at this distance in time it would appear that asian and middle european nations who have suffered socialist depravation within living memory are more inclined towards sound money than the anglo saxons western europeans and japanese who are all still drifting inexorably away from free markets into greater regulation and micro management by the state through monetary manipulation a monetary reset is likely to expose the rift between east and west the divide between ex socialist states and those drifting into greater welfare socialism is characterised by a difference in state finances those enduring the heaviest welfare burden can least afford the immediate strictures for long term monetary stability while russia china and the other asian nations who in the past have suffered communism do not have the high levels of government indebtedness and welfare commitments on the scale of the europeans british japanese and americans there is a risk that the financial war being raged today between the two groups will polarise opinions on the subject of a monetary reset in which case china and russia should emerge in a stronger position than the welfare states in the west even so china has adopted monetary inflation as its primary management tool for promoting economic objectives the remarkable success of the liberated economy is due its emergence from decades of communist suppression rather than monetary inflation though it has admittedly been accelerated by state directed monetary and credit expansion it is therefore unlikely china s leadership will easily give up the facility of monetary inflation for domestic use but as the dollar and euro particularly begin to lose purchasing power through accelerating monetary inflation china and the rest of the eurasian world island are able to turn to gold as backing for cross border settlement at the least this will differ significantly from the route taken by the welfare dependent nations who instinctively will want to exclude gold and instead look for a solution incorporating their own failing currencies mark carney s speech last august at jackson hole confirmed this to be his thinking it centred on the dollar as reserve currency no longer being suitable for a global economy which has changed enormously since it became the de facto standard in 1971 carney s solution is to rearrange the deck chairs on the titanic clearly any move to lessen the dollar s role would be resisted by america furthermore in the eurozone new splits are already developing between the cautious bankers in the bundesbank and the increasingly inflationist ecb it is hard to see how central banks representing the welfare heavy nations will be able to agree on anything blockchain solutions are being explored seven out of ten central banks are said to be actively looking at the possibilities offered by blockchain technologies other than a need to appear proactive towards new technologies it is hard to see a positive role for the technology except perhaps for a scheme to differentiate between currency circulating for trade settlements and domestic circulation one thing is certain if it comes about the use of blockchains will be aimed at increasing control by the state of how money is used presumably that is the superficial attraction to monetary planners china is reported to be well advanced in its undeclared plans for a blockchained currency and could make an announcement shortly it is difficult to see how this would advance the role of the yuan for domestic circulation because banking technology is already highly developed and efficient when it comes to circulating currency furthermore the state controls the banks and has access to all the banking information that would be provided by a blockchain rendering it unnecessary but there may be a role for blockchain technology in trade settlement both the brics initiative and members of the shanghai cooperation organisation may be suited for a dollar replacement in their cross border trade there are two likely options the first is a new blockchained currency representing a mixture of currencies relevant to the trading parties to be used exclusively between members of the two organisations there would be a number of political advantages to such a scheme such as making a clean break with the dollar other than for trade with non members in its battle to maintain the dollar s hegemony america will have convincingly lost its financial war with china finding that half the world s population represented by most of asia brazil and south africa will have turned its back on the dollar at a stroke mark carney s vision of a post dollar world would have happened but perhaps not in the fashion he expected it would be a major defeat for the dollar and mark the end of its hegemonic status and for that reason alone has its attractions for an embattled china a blockchained trade settlement currency would also supplement exchange controls prevalent among the members of the two organisations the disadvantage is that being only backed by the participant s fiat currencies it would be vulnerable to a currency collapse in one or more of its components the second option to introduce gold backing into a new blockchain currency would be more enduring and here it should be noted that all members have gold reserves mine gold and in most cases are actively adding to their gold reserves while the devil may be in the detail this option is a more sensible solution than one based on pure fiat conclusion talk of a global monetary reset is little more than just that we have seen what is required for an enduring solution to the world s monetary ills but western welfare heavy states have neither the mandate nor the theoretical knowledge to implement and understand it for these nations which use dollars euros pounds and yen there is no apparent escape from an eventual fiat money collapse the outlook for brics members and those of the shanghai cooperation organisation has the potential to be more positive if they are prepared to link a new blockchained currency to gold but the replacement of the dollar for inter membership trade for half the world s population would almost certainly trigger an immediate dollar crisis to the obvious detriment of everyone else and implications for the brics and sco members but the dollar s goose is cooked anyway
the democratic party and its liberal supporters are perplexed they presented hours of evidence of an impeachable offense although they studiously avoided charging donald trump with impeachable offenses also carried out by democratic presidents including the continuation or expansion of presidential wars not declared by congress exercising line item veto power playing prosecutor judge jury and executioner to kill individuals including u s citizens anywhere on the planet violating due process and misusing executive orders because civics is no longer taught in most american schools they devoted a day to constitutional scholars who provided the civics 101 case for impeachment the liberal press cheerleading the impeachment process saturated the media landscape with live coverage interminable analysis constant character assassination of trump and giddy speculation and yet it has made no difference public opinion remains largely unaffected perhaps supporters of impeachment argue they failed to adopt the right technique perhaps journalists by giving voice to opponents of impeachment who do indeed live in a world not based in fact created a false equivalency between truth and lies maybe as bill grueskin a professor at the columbia university journalism school writes impeachment advocates should spend 1 million to produce a kind of movie trailer for all those who did not sit through the hours of hearings to boil down the essentials of the film and provide a quick but intense insight into the characters setting the scene with vivid imagery to entice people to come back to the theatre a month later for the full movie or perhaps they need to keep pounding away at trump until his walls of support crumble the liberal class and the democratic party leadership have failed even after their defeat in the 2016 presidential election to understand that they along with the traditional republican elites have squandered their credibility no one believes them and no one should they squandered their credibility by promising that the north american free trade agreement nafta would as claimed by president bill clinton create 200 000 new well paying jobs per year instead several million jobs were lost they squandered it by allowing corporations to move production overseas and hire foreign workers at daily wages that did not equal what a u s unionized worker made in an hour a situation that obliterated the bargaining power of the american working class they squandered it by allowing corporations to use the threat of offshoring production to destroy unions suppress wages extract draconian concessions and push millions of workers into the temp and gig economies where there are no benefits or job security and pay is 60 or less of what a full time employee in the regular economy receives they squandered it by forcing working men and women to take two or three jobs to support a family jacking up household debt to 13 95 trillion they squandered it by redirecting wealth upward so that during the clinton administration alone 45 percent of all income growth went to the wealthiest 1 they squandered it by wiping out small farmers in mexico driving some 3 million of them off their lands and forcing many to migrate in desperation to the united states a human tide that saw the u s right wing and president trump direct mounting rage toward immigrants they squandered it by turning our great cities into urban wastelands they squandered it by slashing welfare and social service programs they squandered it by supporting endless futile wars that have an overall price tag of between 5 trillion and 7 trillion they squandered it by setting up a surveillance system to spy on every american and then lying about it they squandered it by catering to the big banks and gutting financial regulations precipitating the 2008 economic meltdown they squandered it by looting the u s treasury to bail out banks and financial firms guilty of massive financial crimes ordering the federal reserve to hand over an estimated 29 trillion to the global financiers responsible for the crash they squandered it by not using this staggering sum instead to provide free college tuition to every student or universal health care repair our crumbling infrastructure transition to clean energy forgive student debt raise wages bail out underwater homeowners form public banks to foster investments in our communities at low interest rates provide a guaranteed minimum income and organize a massive jobs program for the unemployed and underemployed whose ranks are at least double official statistics they squandered it by cutting child assistance programs most drastically during the clinton administration resulting in 16 million children going to bed hungry every night they squandered it by leaving over half a million americans homeless and on the streets on any given day they squandered it by passing laws that keep students burdened by massive college loan debt that has climbed to 1 4 trillion debt they cannot free themselves from even if they declare bankruptcy they squandered it by militarizing police and building the world s largest system of mass incarceration one with 25 of the world s prison population they squandered it by revoking due process and habeas corpus they squandered it by passing massive tax cuts for the rich and for corporations many of which such as amazon pay no federal income tax ballooning the federal deficit now at 779 billion and climbing they squandered it by privatizing everything from intelligence gathering to public education to swell corporate bank accounts at taxpayer expense they squandered it by permitting corporate money an estimated 9 9 billion will be spent this presidential election cycle on political advertising to buy politicians in a form of legalized bribery that sees corporate lobbyists write legislation and create laws they squandered it by doing nothing to halt the looming ecocide the problem is not messaging the problem is the messenger the mortal wounds inflicted on our democratic institutions are bipartisan the traditional republican elites are as hated as the democratic elites trump is vile imbecilic corrupt and incompetent but for a largely white working class cast aside by austerity and neoliberalism he at least taunts the elites who destroyed their communities and their lives the shakedown that trump clumsily attempted to orchestrate against the president of ukraine in the hope of discrediting joe biden a potential rival in the 2020 presidential election pales beside the shakedown orchestrated by the elites who rule over america s working men and women this shakedown took from those workers their hope and more ominously their hope for their children it took from them security and a sense of place and dignity it took from them a voice in how they were governed it took from them their country and handed it to a cabal of global corporatists who intend to turn them into serfs this shakedown plunged millions into despair it led many to self destructive opioid alcohol drug and gambling addictions it led to increases in suicide mass shootings and hate crimes this shakedown led to bizarre conspiracy theories and fabrications peddled by a neofascist right wing deceptions bolstered by the lies told by those tasked with keeping the society rooted in truth and verifiable fact this shakedown led to the end of the rule of law and the destruction of democratic institutions that if they had continued to function could have prevented the rise to power of a demagogue such as trump there is zero chance trump will be removed from office in a trial in the senate the democratic party elites have admitted as much they carried out they argue their civic and constitutional duty but here again they lie they picked out what was convenient to impeach trump and left untouched the rotten system they helped create the divisions among americans will only widen the hatreds will only grow and tyranny will wrap its deadly tentacles around our throats

two of the biggest hurdles constraining the world economy have just been cleared dogged for most of 2019 by trade tensions and political risk that hammered business confidence the outlook for global growth will enter 2020 on a firmer footing after the us and china struck a partial trade deal and outlook for brexit cleared somewhat the china trade deal and uk election result have taken out a major tail risk overhanging markets and companies said ben emons managing director for global macro strategy at medley global advisors in new york business confidence should see a large boost that could see a restart of global investment inventory rebuild and a resurgence of global trade volume like financial markets most economists had factored in some kind of phase one trade agreement between the world s largest economies when projecting the world economy would stabilize into 2020 after a recession scare earlier this year but at a minimum the agreement between president donald trump and president xi jinping means some of the more dire scenarios being contemplated just a few months ago now appear less likely bloomberg economics estimated in june that the cost of the us china trade war could reach 1 2 trillion by 2021 with the impact spread across the asian supply chain that estimate was based on 25 per cent tariffs on all us china trade and a 10 per cent drop in stock markets the phase one deal nevertheless leaves some complicated issues unresolved paving the way for fresh clashes as trump runs for reelection next november still to be dealt with are us complaints over the vast web of subsidies ranging from cheap electricity to low cost loans that china has used to build its industrial might trump said talks over a phase two deal will start immediately what bloomberg economists say a trade deal that takes tariffs back to may 2019 levels for the us that would mean 25 per cent on 50 billion in china imports and 10 per cent on another 200 billion and lowers uncertainty could boost global gdp for 2020 by 0 6 per cent a breakdown in talks and higher tariffs still a possibility given how past agreements have broken down would drag global output down 0 1 per cent tom orlik chief economist bloomberg economics as for brexit the sweeping election victory by prime minister boris johnson s conservative party means britain is set to leave the eu on jan 31 bloomberg economics says the result puts a growth rebound in play which coupled with looser fiscal policy means activity should accelerate over 2019 at the same time johnson must now negotiate a new trade deal with the eu by the end of next year meaning fresh uncertainty could emerge brexit could continue to weigh on economic activity as the difficult task of forging the uk s new trading relationships is just beginning said simon wells chief european economist at hsbc holdings plc the twin developments come amid broader signs that demand across much of the world is stabilizing as key manufacturing gauges trough the international monetary fund had flagged upside risks to its recent outlook if major trade tensions were resolved policy makers have also sounded more upbeat this week european central bank president christine lagarde said the euro zone s economic slowdown was showing signs of bottoming out and federal reserve chairman jerome powell said the prognosis for the us remains favorable the chinese government said it would improve the effectiveness of fiscal policy in 2020 while japan is planning new fiscal stimulus morgan stanley economists expect the global economy to recover some momentum in 2020 with growth improving from a trough of 2 9 per cent in the fourth quarter of this year to 3 4 per cent by the end of 2020 with that uptick driven more by the rest of the world than the us source bloomberg

here s our summary of key events over the weekend that affect new zealand with news the world trade landscape is changing with imports falling worldwide firstly it does look like the end of the beginning in the us china trade war has arrived the so called phase one deal has been agreed and the us won t impose the next set of tariffs neither will china and unlike other claims this one has been confirmed by beijing market reactions are mixed american equity and bond markets weren t enthusiastic but the shanghai equity market rose an impressive 1 8 tokyo rose even more up 2 6 and hong kong was also up 2 6 it will be interesting to watch wall street when it opens tomorrow the deal sees the us halve tariffs on about 120 bln of trade while the chinese don t have to reduce any tariffs but they said they will china will buy some ag products but actually how much is in doubt it sets up a dispute resolution process but that is one where each side becomes judge jury executioner for any claim and is in fact just a kangaroo court basis pretty amateur the key element is that the ambition is very low with enforcement a joke so this deal is more theatrics than ground breaking and the international community won t be following this model this is a time however when we can assess the impact so far of the trade war not only on the us and china but other large economies as well import volume data compiled by interest co nz from oecd data shows that imports fell the least in the us and only recently from its peak in june 2019 american imports have fallen just 0 5 of gdp since that compares with a 0 8 of gdp fall in japan a 0 9 fall in the eu and a 1 4 fall in china so it has been china and not the us who has used this time to wean itself off of imports and most of those are from the us basically the americans have kept on buying chinese goods and the american public or businesses have paid the higher tariffed prices so perhaps it is no surprise that washington has wanted a deal one that seems to have damaged their trade but superpower rival very little the phase one trade deal won t move either china s or the us s trade even 0 1 of gdp either way maybe there is another reason for the muted wall street response weak november retail sales they rose at only a very modest pace in november virtually flat from october and only up 2 9 above the same month a year ago and a slower than expected start to the holiday shopping season and given that american inflation is up 2 1 in the year the gains look very mediocre business inventories were up 3 1 in the year in china foreign direct investment levels are rising they are up 6 in 2019 so far a gain of us 124 bln almost 30 of that is in high tech sectors and that portion grew a remarkable 28 in the year data for japanese industrial production for the year to october looks very discouraging down 7 7 and that is a faster rate of decline than for the year to september but that was in the shadow of their gst increase and when the typhoon hit looking forward they are more optimistic with 2020 growth of 1 4 partly as a result of an infrastructure stimulus boost in india the presumption is that their export prowess is all about services call centers it services and the like but it turns out these service exports are growing slower than their overall economy and declining they were up just 5 25 in the year to october the latest un climate negotiations in madrid look like they have gone nowhere the imf is warning australian regulators to be ready to act should rapid housing debt growth continue on current trends saying looser financial conditions could re accelerate asset price inflation boosting private consumption but also adding to medium term vulnerabilities given high household debt levels the ust 10yr yield is at 1 82 and very little different from this time last week bond markets seem sceptical of the trade war deal their 2 10 curve is unchanged at 22 bps their 1 5 curve is at 12 bps their 3m 10yr curve is less positive 26 bps the aussie govt 10yr is down 9 bps from friday at 1 16 the china govt 10yr is virtually unchanged at 3 22 the nz govt 10 yr is now at 1 58 and unchanged from friday although it is up 9 bps in a week gold is at us 1 476 oz and up us 16 for the week us oil prices are up further to just on us 60 bbl and the brent benchmark is now just at us 65 bbl the kiwi dollar will start the week firm at 66 usc on the cross rates we are holding at 95 9 auc against the euro we are little changed at 59 3 euro cents that puts our twi 5 at just on 71 and marginally firmer for the week bitcoin is now at us 7 086 and down 2 5 from where we left it on saturday the bitcoin rate is charted in the exchange rate set below the easiest place to stay up with event risk today is by following our economic calendar here

yesterday s biggest trade news was that the house democratic leadership reached a deal with the trump administration on changes to the u s mexico canada agreement usmca which was signed by canada mexico and the united states last year the agreement was an effort to renegotiate the north american free trade agreement nafta reception of the new deal was mixed and after taking leadership of the house in january of this year democrats wanted to leave their own imprint on the new trade agreement in light of yesterday s announcement and today s release of the protocol of amendment by the office of the u s trade representative we repeat our analysis from october 2018 in this blog post with updates to take into account the recent changes this is by no means a comprehensive analysis since there is a lot in the 2000 page document that makes up the usmca as modern trade agreements go well beyond traditional trade issues some of what is in there is good and some of it is bad with many of the non trade issues there is likely to be disagreement as to which provision falls into which category in this blog post we offer our thoughts on some of the key provisions after which we provide an initial overall assessment of the agreement for each item we indicate in a parenthetical whether there have been changes from the usmca signed last year to the amendments released today we break it down into the good the interesting the whatever the worrying the bad and the ugly the good canadian agriculture no changes in terms of liberalization in the usmca the most important component is the liberalization of canadian agriculture imports such as dairy products eggs wheat poultry and wine dairy market access was a key concern for the united states which has long complained about canada s strict supply management and quota system the office of the united states trade representative ustr has noted the opening of canada s dairy market as a key achievement because it gives the u s additional access to what was agreed in the trans pacific partnership agreement tpp in addition canada agreed to give up a pricing system for certain types of milk as well as expanding the u s quota for chicken eggs and turkey on wine the u s and canada agreed in a side letter that the canadian province of british columbia bc would adjust its measures restricting the sale on non bc wine in its grocery stores the united states agreed to give bc until november 2019 to make this adjustment before advancing a complaint it already put forward at the world trade organization wto on this issue as of july 2019 bc has allowed for imported wine to be sold in grocery stores canadian agriculture liberalization is the most positive part of the new agreement as it gives u s producers greater access to the canadian market and will be good for consumers in canada de minimis the de minimis threshold for products that you buy online and can be imported duty free has been raised for canada and mexico since 2016 the united states allows people to purchase goods up to 800 duty free and has been pushing for canada and mexico to raise their limits as well it did not persuade them to do so in the tpp in the usmca however canada raised its de minimis threshold to cad 150 a significant increase from the previous cad 20 limit in addition sales tax cannot be collected until the value of the product reaches at least cad 40 this is good for canadian consumers and small businesses making online purchases additionally a 2016 study showed that increasing the duty free limit would be cost saving for canada mexico also increased its de minimis level from usd 50 to usd 100 with tax free de minimis on usd 50 ustr has noted that this will be especially helpful for small businesses there was however a concerning footnote in article 7 8 that would allow the united states to lower its de minimis threshold to a reciprocal level of another party s if that party s de minimis is lower this just means that the united states could potentially reduce its de minimis threshold to that of canada or mexico s this effort received bipartisan pushback and reports suggest that in the final implementing bill the footnote will be removed though this is not specified in today s amendments this would be a positive development for preserving congress role in regulating commerce state to state dispute settlement in order to ensure that the obligations that have been agreed to in a trade agreement are followed there needs to be an enforcement mechanism chapters 11 19 and 20 of the original nafta are often bundled together as dispute settlement chapters but they all do different things chapter 20 is the basic provision that allows one government to complain that another government is not complying with its obligations the original nafta chapter 20 did not work very well and unfortunately the original usmca failed to fix its flaws with the 2019 update though it looks like most of these problems have been fixed a roster of panelists will now by established by the date of entry into force of the agreement and the formation of a panel can no longer be blocked while we still have some questions regarding certain language overall this is a substantial improvement the interesting investment protection isds no change these provisions have been significantly scaled back we see this as a positive because the evidence does not show much if any impact on investment flows due to these provisions they mostly just mean lots of litigation and controversy the business groups and gop members of congress who support these provisions have been willing to accept the change regulatory cooperation no change one notable addition to usmca was an expansive chapter on good regulatory practices which builds upon the tpp regulatory coherence chapter the canada eu comprehensive and economic trade agreement ceta and bilateral initiatives that have been in place between the u s and canada as well as with mexico since 2011 the key items in this chapter are provisions on increasing transparency in the regulatory process providing a clear rationale for new regulatory actions as well as encouraging cooperation on minimizing divergence in regulatory outcomes the general idea is to make regulations less burdensome on trade it will be interesting to see how this chapter functions in practice but it appears to be the most comprehensive attempt to address this issue in any trade agreement the united states has signed digital trade no change the digital trade provisions are very similar to what was in the tpp in theory these provisions can help facilitate e commerce the u s international trade commission says they will provide certainty but we are skeptical they are still untested and it is not clear what impact they will have there were rumors that democrats would push to remove language in the usmca borrowed from section 230 of the communications decency act which removes liability for third party content hosted on online platforms in addition to providing flexibility for these platforms to exercise a good faith effort to moderate this content however after the amendment this language remains in place and the tech industry appears pleased with this status quo the whatever chapter 19 no change the special review mechanism for anti dumping countervailing duties in the famous chapter 19 has been shifted to chapter 10 but remains essentially the same this provision does not have much if any commercial impact but canada insisted on keeping it nonetheless and was able to push back on u s demands to eliminate it the worrying currency no change this is the first trade agreement with binding provisions related to exchange rates although not all of this chapter s provisions are enforceable there are few concerns with canada s and mexico s practices in this area so this provision is really just a marker to lay down for future agreements the test of this provision will be if another country for which such concerns have been raised e g japan agrees to it while there may be real issues with currency intervention here and there the problems here have been exaggerated and have been used by politicians as an excuse to impose tariffs ip provisions the intellectual property chapter strengthened ip protections going beyond what was agreed to in the tpp for example in the original usmca the parties agreed to 10 years of data exclusivity for biologic drugs up from 5 to 8 in the tpp copyright protection to a minimum of the life of the author plus 70 years and 75 years for copyrights not based on the life of a person as part of the 2019 update the provisions that established a 10 year market exclusivity period for biologic drugs were deleted and certain other provisions were modified or removed as well section 232 auto tariffs no change as part of the nafta renegotiations canada and mexico had hoped to secure an exemption from the potential imposition of additional section 232 tariffs on autos however instead of an outright exemption there are two separate side letters to the usmca for canada and mexico that exempt a set quota of passenger vehicle imports and auto parts as well as all light truck imports from 232 tariffs that may be imposed in the future the united states also agreed not to impose 232 tariffs on canada or mexico for at least 60 days after the measure is imposed allowing the u s to negotiate separate agreements within that timeframe the exemption levels are high enough that all auto exports from canada and mexico could be exempt which is good news
the u s dollar s position as the world s reserve currency might be weakening in the last few years the fraction of global reserves denominated in dollars has been inching down this follows a longer term slide at the turn of the century more than 70 of reserves were in dollars meanwhile central banks are buying more gold which could signal a lack of confidence in the dollar or the global monetary system more generally if the dollar loses its status as the reserve currency it would be a major shift in the global economy the likes of which only happens once or twice a century what happens then is anybody s guess the result could be chaos if it s mismanaged but if it s handled well the loss of the reserve currency could be healthy for the u s and the world indeed given the u s s waning economic dominance the consequences of keeping the dollar as the sole reserve currency could be worse because the dollar is the reserve currency central banks around the world hold large amounts of dollar denominated assets mostly u s government bonds they hold these reserves for a number of reasons to maintain exchange rate pegs to insure against capital outflows and to facilitate international trade in the 19th century countries held their reserves in gold or in british pounds which were backed by gold but after world war i the u s accumulated a large share of the world s gold meaning that holding dollars became the next best thing to holding the yellow metal itself this arrangement was formalized in the bretton woods agreement of 1944 when the dollar became the world s official reserve currency and the u s promised to hold large amounts of gold in the early 1970s all connection between the dollar and gold was severed but the u s remained the reserve currency of choice so why is dollar dominance slipping now one long term reason is the rise of the euro as an alternative reserve currency a more recent factor is china s increasing desire to diversify its foreign exchange holdings to reduce its vulnerability to shifts in u s policy amid the trade war but in the long term the shrinking u s share of world economic output is the biggest threat to the dollar s status in 1960 the u s represented about 40 of the world economy but that has shrunk to less than a quarter as poorer nations catch up to rich ones they face pressure to diversify and hold less of their growing reserve stockpiles in the currency of one decreasingly important country it s no coincidence that the 1980s when the dollar dipped below half of global reserves were a time when it looked as if the u s might be economically eclipsed by a rising europe and japan that didn t happen but this time it might economists have a hard time predicting the effects of a shift away from the dollar because this is to some extent uncharted territory one theory says that american borrowers would be forced to pay higher interest rates causing the u s economy to suffer now in order to acquire dollar reserves foreigners essentially are forced to lend money to either the u s government or to u s companies that demand for u s assets can bid down the price of loans within the u s but former federal reserve chair ben bernanke argues that the u s no longer enjoys this so called exorbitant privilege noting that other countries real interest rates are almost as low bernanke could be wrong those other countries rates might be held down by their slow population growth while the faster growing u s benefits from reserve status instead but in a world already awash in capital the extra effect of reserve status is probably not that much another theory says that the u s would benefit less demand for the dollar would cause the currency to depreciate that would cut the price of u s exports and make imports more costly reducing the trade deficit that could ultimately lead to a more balanced global economy it could even potentially help the u s become more competitive in manufacturing and other high value export industries but as paul krugman has noted reserve currency status might not be that big a factor because a number of other countries have run big trade deficits in recent decades as well in the end a shift to a basket of world currencies might be the healthiest outcome if the euro yen and yuan were to join the dollar as international reserve currencies it would mean a safer and more stable global economy and it would enable the world s major economies to compete on a more or less level playing field the problem is the other major economies may be either unwilling or unable to help bring about that outcome the euro zone crisis cast doubt on that currency s long term dominance while china shows no inclination to abandon capital controls and make the yuan fully convertible reserve holding countries may thus be stuck with the dollar and the u s and its central bank may be stuck with the unenviable task of stabilizing a global economy that increasingly dwarfs it in size source bloomberg
beijing china plans to set a lower economic growth target of around 6 per cent in 2020 from this year s 6 6 5pcpc relying on increased state infrastructure spending to ward off a sharper slowdown policy sources said chinese leaders are trying to support growth to limit job losses that could affect social stability but are facing pressure to tackle debt risks caused by pump priming policies the proposed target to be unveiled at china s annual parliamentary session in early march 2020 was endorsed by top leaders at the annual closed door central economic work conference this month according to three sources with knowledge of the meeting s outcome we aim to keep next year s growth within a reasonable range or around 6pc said a source who requested anonymity top leaders pledged to keep economic policies stable while making them more effective to achieve growth targets in 2020 state media said on thursday next year will be crucial for the ruling communist party to fulfill its goal of doubling gross domestic product gdp and incomes in the decade to 2020 economic growth of nearly 6pc next year could be enough to meet that goal given the economy is expected to expand about 6 2pc this year policy insiders said officials at the national development and reform commission and the ministry of finance were not immediately available for comment on saturday the government aims to boost infrastructure investment by allowing local governments to issue more special bonds next year but there is less room for tax cuts the sources said the annual budget deficit could rise from this year s 2 8pc of gdp but is likely to be kept within 3pc they said local governments could be allowed to issue special bonds worth some 3 trillion yuan 426 20 billion in 2020 to fund infrastructure projects including 1tr yuan front loaded to this year they said fiscal policy will provide a key support for the economy said one source the central bank is likely to ease policy further to encourage lending and lower corporate funding costs but it wants to avoid fanning property speculation and inflation expectations after consumer inflation hit a near eight year high in november the sources said beijing has unveiled a raft of pro growth measures this year cutting taxes and fees and letting localities issue 2 15tr yuan in special bonds alongside cuts in reserve requirements and lending rates to boost credit but top leaders have ruled out aggressive stimulus for fear of pushing up debt levels a trade deal with the united states could ease pressure on chinese exporters but more policy steps are needed to underpin weak demand at home and abroad policy insiders said the united states and china cooled their trade war on friday announcing an agreement that reduces some us tariffs in exchange for what us officials said would be more chinese purchases of american farm products and other goods published in dawn december 15th 2019
pete buttigieg the mayor of south bend ind came to the post on friday to talk about why he is running for president and what he hopes to accomplish if elected here is the full transcript and audio recording of our conversation fred hiatt editorial page editor highlights of buttigieg s comments from the interview click on a highlight to jump ahead in the transcript below the full transcript fred hiatt editorial page editor thank you for coming we really appreciate it and we asked our readers if they had questions and we actually have a lot of really smart subscribers so i thought i might start with one of theirs mayor pete buttigieg sounds good fred hiatt which is what lessons can we draw from the results of the u k election how do you see the results affecting the u s and i would just add is there any lesson for the democratic party in particular pete buttigieg well i think it begins with the understanding that the u k is in a very unique situation i do think there is something to be said for the importance of unifying and coalition building leadership and i think that s been a challenge for labour then again if you re looking at the u k and looking at what makes the tories comparatively politically successful outside of the brexit drama a lot of it s that the conservative party there has adopted positions that here would be considered liberal for example i think they re on board with the 2050 climate plan that would be carbon neutral by then which is clearly what we ve got to do and here in the u s i think we ve got to recognize the fact that a healthy american majority exists for common sense positions that are also progressive positions whether it s on climate whether it s on health on wages even issues where my party has been on defense like immigration or guns right now there s a healthy majority if we can keep it that s not really reflected in the way congress works and the way washington works but i think the job of a nominee and certainly the job of the president is to galvanize and not polarize that majority and work with the american people to get something done so a lot of the analogies between the u s and u k break down given the complexities of what they re dealing with but it is worth thinking about in the american context what it means to make sure you can build out that majority that s ready for change fred hiatt and does the primary process work against galvanizing that majority here pete buttigieg i don t think so i don t think it has to but i think redistricting reform is needed certainly the way that the primary process meets the creation of districts that are drawn such that politicians are picking out their voters instead of the other way around leads to all kinds of problems in the way congress works but i think that the nominating process is our best chance to hash out these differences that are substantive but nowhere close to the difference in values and the sense of urgency that motivates all of us on the democratic side as well as a lot of independents and an increasing number of what i call future former republicans to want to mobilize to end the trump presidency and trumpism with it molly roberts editorial writer so you unlike your current competitors have more or less grown up with the internet do you think that the web s impact on the world has been net positive or net negative and how has your outlook on that changed over the years pete buttigieg who was it who said about the french revolution that in terms of its impact it s too soon to say stephen stromberg editorial writer zhou enlai charles lane editorial writer i think it s a fake quote but whatever fred hiatt so probably winston churchill pete buttigieg but really we ll need a couple hundred years before we can say for sure what i will say is that the development of internet technology started with a sense that it s a frail flower and we need to leave it alone and see what ll happen and now it has grown into something that i think threatens to devour us if we don t manage it in a better way and without smarter and more effective regulation you re going to continue to see a world where large tech companies make corporate policy decisions that are actually public policy decisions because they have so much impact but they do it without any of the mechanisms of democratic government that we have when we make real public policy decisions and that s one of the reasons why it was alarming to see the spectacle as we have a couple of times of a tech founder being grilled by a panel of legislators who make it abundantly clear that they have no idea what it is they re regulating i think asking whether the web or tech is good or bad misses the fact that it is what we make of it right and it s the air we breathe we ve got to make sure that the air is healthy molly roberts so i guess we can talk about how to make sure the air is healthy you said in a speech that it s not enough to combat falsehoods we must also disseminate truth and that it s time we took an integrated and innovative approach bridging public and private sectors so that raises the question of what was fred hiatt that was in the context of global communication molly roberts the public and private sector bridge i think is a big question right now about you don t want these tech companies to be making these corporate decisions that are public policy decisions but also especially when it comes to an area like speech getting government involved is tricky i m curious on that speech question what role you think you think there is for government to play pete buttigieg yeah there s no obvious fix here but we know for example there s a precedent in the context of american politics for regulations on campaign spending so when you have tech companies making money off of political speech in the form of advertising i do believe they have a responsibility to verify the truth of that advertising we certainly would expect a tv station or a newspaper to bear responsibility for the veracity of anything they published by way of advertising for money why wouldn t that also be an expectation for tech i also think that some of this can be cooperative there are certainly areas where we want to make sure that government is supporting efforts to do the right thing as we have with for example issues around human trafficking that can be abetted by technology and that could be a model that needs to be certainly refined and improved but could point the way toward where government can get involved without arousing some of the worst first amendment issues that we have to worry about molly roberts there s been in particular question of removing the shield that tech companies have that makes sure that they re not liable for content posted by third parties or any old user do you have any thoughts on that pete buttigieg i think it needs to be on the table again i don t think that there is a meat cleaver approach that s going to work here because it does get into first amendment issues but you also see a lot of tech companies having it both ways saying that you know this is protected speech and that hey we re just a bulletin board and at the same time monetizing what s going on there and if you re drawing revenue from content directly or perhaps indirectly that creates responsibilities fred hiatt if i can follow up on verifying the truth let s say you have a candidate who says climate change is a hoax do you want mark zuckerberg saying they re not allowed to do that on facebook pete buttigieg so there is a reason why they don t want to be in charge of that and there are cases where the government can t be in charge of that either but we do recognize as a matter of law some extent to which lying can lead to legal consequences we can always craft problematic hypotheticals but remember how fake news got started it was not disagreeable news it was newspaper or you know online articles circulating saying you know the pope endorsed donald trump flatly demonstrably uncontroversially false statements we can least begin there and assign responsibility for that knowing that there will always be challenging boundary cases molly roberts and just to be clear so that s talking about disinformation and more probably that maybe it doesn t spread in advertising do you think that technology companies should be policing that disinformation even when it s not monetized which is a distinction i think you were drawing before pete buttigieg yeah i think they still have a responsibility there but it does get more complex the more you zoom out and this can t only be something that the tech companies do they have responsibility we also need to make sure we become harder targets in the same way that now when my eye falls on a page of the washington post that has a full page ad even if it resembles newsprint within a couple of seconds my brain will have enough pattern recognition to realize it s an ad i m not sure we have that same pattern recognition that we ve developed in the same way when it comes to what we see online and so we need to make sure that in addition to holding companies responsible we make sure just as a matter of citizenship that we are better equipped to resist the interventions of trolls bots and other forms of misinformation molly roberts as far as what that looks like you could also theoretically regulate that have rules for exactly how a digital ad should be displayed how small the text could be pete buttigieg well and the appeal of that is that it moves in the direction of enforcing an expectation of transparency rather than enforcing a certain standard of what speech is true or false or good or harmful and so i think again looking at some of the examples that have come from responsible regulation of political advertising gives us a pretty good launching point for these questions christine emba columnist have you had conversations with tech executives about this what sort of conversations are you having i know some candidates have a more antagonistic seeming relationship it seems but i mean you are in contact with mark zuckerberg i think already right pete buttigieg well i mean we knew the same people in college and i ve known him socially we don t sit around talking about the questions we re talking about now but i ll say this i have noticed in silicon valley that there s a lot of i think concern among people who are coming to terms with what it is they ve created and maybe it s less among the ceos than it is among the kind of middle layer of folks who built out some of these technologies with a sense of tech utopianism that was really kind of prevailing as recently as 10 or 15 years ago and they re now realizing the implications of what s been created and so we just have to do the right thing from a policy perspective but we should also i think press those who are involved in industry to recognize what s at stake and and try to get them on the right side salwan georges the washington post charles lane i would like to ask you something about the economy and i think in a way the fact that we ve been in a meeting with a presidential candidate and it didn t come up first is itself very indicative because the economy by any measure broadly is doing extremely well right now we have 3½ percent unemployment the gallup survey says that 67 percent of americans roughly regard their personal finances as good or excellent your job and that of the other candidates would be a whole lot easier in trying to take on an incumbent now who is plus 12 in his management of the economy and underwater on everything else if those numbers weren t true so my question to you is how do you in the face of that knowing that president trump is up 12 points on his favorability on the economy persuade people that the economy won t kind of go the other way if he s not around and specifically what about it needs changing pete buttigieg first of all i think we re measuring the wrong things don t get me wrong low unemployment is better than high unemployment gdp growth is better than gdp contraction but my presidency would view the most important economic statistic as neither of those but rather the income growth of the 90 percent that captures some of those other things captures growth in the economy it captures employment but what it also does is prevents us from believing that everything s going along just fine when you have a lot of economic growth and it barely gets to most americans which is the circumstance we re dealing with right now go back to 2016 when also the economy by those conventional measures was doing great and we allegedly had an economic anxiety election what we re seeing right now is the gdp going up and life expectancy going down at the same time in the united states of america that shouldn t even be possible and it reflects that the headline numbers around the dow jones are not really capturing the american experience i would argue not even capturing the american economic experience today add to that the fact that even by the kinds of numbers that are conventionally cited it s pretty hard to argue that this president s management is brilliant relative to his predecessor after all president obama came in with unemployment around 10 left with it around 5 the new president comes in and sees it at 5 go to 4 and he s like the rooster who thinks he made the sun come up in the morning his basic pitch on the economy seems to be go ahead and tolerate the chaos tolerate the racial division tolerate the bad example for your children and in return for that i will give you economic growth almost as good as barack obama did i think it s actually a weak case at the end of the day what we need is to make sure that american lives are secure first of all that they re secured against the ups and downs of the economy and also ensure that we invest in the domestic sources of our economic growth and competitiveness which include the basics the very basics that have been eroded both in the last two years and certainly in a bigger sense over the last 40 years in our country education infrastructure health the fundamentals of social mobility and if we continue disinvesting in those we shouldn t be surprised to continue to see america fall completely out of the top ranks of countries in which the american dream of being born at the bottom and coming out at the top can be experienced david ignatius columnist i d like to ask you three baseline foreign policy questions foreign policy hasn t been much of a subject in the democratic debates in the campaign so let me just focus on these three first would you be inclined to be willing to pursue some small residual force in afghanistan focused on counterterrorism after some peace agreement is concluded second if the american troop presence in northeast syria continues roughly something under a thousand that the president vaguely defined but we all kind of know that it s about supporting stability there the day you take office if those troops are still there would you be inclined to keep them and finally would you think about seeking to rejoin the jcpoa or the iran nuclear agreement if you became president pete buttigieg so the syria model actually informs the answer i think to the afghanistan question in the medium term after all what we had there was a small number of troops special operations and intelligence capacity really a tiny number if we talk about the area that the president withdrew from who were able to prevent the worst outcomes just by being there and i think that as we develop a much more narrow and specific account of what the american objective in afghanistan is which from a military perspective is the defense of the american homeland from a political perspective it s a lot more we want to continue to support gains that have been made there but from a military perspective it s protecting america then it does lead to a likely medium term scenario where the bulk of the ground troops are gone something by the way that i believed was underway in 2014 i thought i was made to feel like i was one of the very last troops turning out the lights when we were packing up and leaving and years later we re still there in comparable proportion so that s clearly got to come to an end but part of that way out in order to keep the core american security objectives may well involve a very light footprint presence of highly specialized and capable intelligence and special operations people on the ground as for iran it s unlikely that we could simply resurrect and rejoin the jcpoa in its prior form but leaving it was a mistake and agreements to contain iranian nuclear ambitions remain a good idea the picture is different the economic pressures are different the political scenario is different and crucially our relationship with some of the allies that account for i believe the j stands for joint the allies that account for the coalition that was securing this has obviously changed but i also think there remains an opportunity especially given the economic if not isolation certainly vulnerability of the iranian regime to achieve something that would help us once again slow or stop the move toward nuclear weapons there karen tumulty columnist could i just follow up the post just published thousands and thousands and thousands of pages of interviews that show that military leaders and administration leaders were consistently lying to the american public about the goals in afghanistan and progress toward those goals having served there does this surprise you and what do you think are the implications of that going forward pete buttigieg the truth is it is not completely surprising although it s extremely frustrating when i think about the weight that i placed on decisions that i made as a lieutenant on whether to go outside the wire to meet some afghan police official and if i did who to take with me and just how i weighed that to see these kinds of reports about people making the decisions that affected thousands of lives instead of two or three at a time like my decisions is disheartening but it s also i think an indication of how removed some of the conversations happening certainly the conversations happening in washington became from just the experience of being involved in this conflict from the perspective of communities like mine that are sending so many people into the military and knowing that relative to the people making decisions the folks going into the military are more likely to be low income more likely to be people of color more likely to be from lower income and often rural areas it feels like the conversation has drifted so far away from doing right by them and you certainly feel that when you read these kinds of things fred hiatt so you distinguish between the political and military goals i think the number of troops in afghanistan is down to 12 000 if the defense and intelligence experts working for you come to you and say we don t need 10 000 to do your counterinsurgency mission but if we keep 10 000 there we can keep the taliban at bay and girls can stay in school if we don t if not then we lose those political gains how do you process that pete buttigieg so i don t think that it can be as simple a scenario as a troop count leading to a societal outcome on the contrary if that were true we d somewhere in the last 15 years have been able to declare victory i think that what we need to recognize is first of all the role of the afghans in their self determination secondly the role of the international community in supporting aspirations like securing and expanding the gains for women in human rights there that are not just american policy objectives they are human rights objectives that are consistent with what the community of nations wants to see and i believe what the afghan people want and our own responsibility because of the fact that we changed the trajectory of that country to ensure that there is no backsliding especially when it comes to the rights of women this is one of the reasons why it s so important that the afghan government be at the table more than from public reporting they appear to have been in the conversations that have gone on with with the taliban and so there will not be an easy way to deliver this i mean empires have famously despaired of trying to get certain outcomes to happen in this area but we do have responsibilities that go beyond our military objective and should use a number of different tools in our toolkit to try to bring them about and to secure them fred hiatt just on david s point about the place of foreign policy and a campaign i noticed on your website when you go to issues you have to then go to more issues before you come to foreign policy and it just made me wonder this year as you go around to what extent is it on people s mind do they worry about terrorism pete buttigieg sure i d say it s on people s minds more than you would think when i m on the road i was surprised to find myself being the first candidate to do a major foreign policy address when whenever we did that was in may in the springtime and i think that it deserves more attention than it s getting although politically it s often one of those things that gets little attention until something happens and suddenly it s the only issue on people s minds but i will tell you i hear a lot more about foreign policy than i hear about impeachment for example in terms of the questions that i get from voters and they re not always arcane questions of foreign policy there are questions about what are we going to do with america s relationship to the world the fact that american prestige has been reduced to an snl mockery of the guy in the lunchroom nobody wants to talk to shows you what s at stake and something that goes beyond just what s interesting to foreign policy buffs but the more basic question of whether america can continue to be regarded as a credible reliable force for good in the world something on which our own security depends because our advantage has always been that our interests have aligned with universal interests or i should say universal values as well as more specific concerns when you re in communities for example that have disproportionately furnished the troops who ve been sent to carry out these policies right now there s probably a kid in iowa or south carolina or indiana who is packing their bags for afghanistan and wondering exactly what it is we re doing there fred hiatt what are the other things people ask pete buttigieg one more point that kid could not have been born on 9 11 necessarily salwan georges the washington post fred hiatt what are the top three things that people do ask you about pete buttigieg a lot of health care a lot on opportunity especially in areas that have been excluded whether we re talking about the continuing effects of racial exclusion in creating a racial wealth gap and racial income gap in this country or the concerns of folks in the industrializing areas or in rural areas by the way far more than is true in the imagination of commentary sometimes that s the same thing when you re in south carolina talking about rural issues you re typically talking about african american rural issues when you re in the industrial midwest talking about the fate of autoworkers a lot of times we re talking about workers of color so we ve got to recognize the intersections here but that s coming up all the time a lot of questions that i field are a little broader than the policy level they re really about belonging they re about division they re about exclusion you can feel it it s an understanding that maybe the american experience in general in recent years but especially under trump is characterized by division and exclusion and it shows in different ways but you can tell it s on folks minds on everything from the way that our families have become divided to the fear of whether it s really going to be possible for the next president to leave the american people more unified than before so i get lots of different forms of that question but i d say it s coming up all the time and then if we want to talk about questions that are out of proportion to how much they re covered obviously health care gets covered a lot economic issues get covered a lot mental health though is something that comes up all the time and not only at a general level from individuals and families who were impacted but it is something i hear almost as often as i hear about pay when i m talking to teachers because there s a sense that teachers have been put on the front lines of mental health without the resources to do much about it and that s not just in terms of mental health first aid training that they need but the ability to actually know where to refer people when there are issues sometimes i ll do a show of hands but i ll just ask sometimes of hundreds of people how many folks here would say that you or a co worker or a family member have had an addiction issue or a serious mental health issue and just about every hand goes up so relative to how much attention that commands i think it s huge and deserves to be talked about more stephen stromberg so on health care you have your medicare for all who want it plan and you say if corporate insurers are unable or unwilling to lower costs or offer plans that are dramatically better than what s available today competition from this public insurance alternative will naturally lead to medicare for all one way to read this is that you favor a subsidized public plan that would undercut rather than really compete with private plans so are you really able to say that if you like your private plan you can keep it pete buttigieg well if a private plan is sucking money out into profits or failing to efficiently deliver care then it deserves to fall down in the face of the plan that we re going to create what i do see is a lot of cases where folks and i m especially thinking of people in labor are reluctant to entertain leaving or being kicked off their plan not so much because they think that the administrator is more efficient but because the plan is more generous and so we want to make sure that we re not setting the line in a way that nobody could ever go above on what health care support ought to like in this country i do think that functionally it amounts to a floor we re going to set a floor and either through the generosity of an employer or through the efficiency of an administrator folks can try to beat that plan but we should be that floor we ve got to make sure that the floor is there and i think that leads to the most organic pathway towards what will be either a dramatically improved system or medicare for all environment and i m pretty neutral on whether it needs to be one or the other i ve said publicly that i favor medicare for all as the destination i envision that s most attractive but honestly the most important thing is not who s covering you it s are you covered and are you covered well stephen stromberg so the the public plan it would be you take what you take out of the profits from the insurance companies and the maladministration as you mentioned in some of these insurance plans and yours you re saying that underneath that there is sort of an efficient private model that could compete with a public model that you re suggesting pete buttigieg that s what i want to put as a test and if it can t compete then that s not a bad thing ruth marcus deputy editorial page editor can i ask a question about something that may not come up on the campaign trail very much it certainly doesn t come up among your rivals that much you said the other day about the debt and deficit my party is not known for worrying about the deficit or debt too much but it s time for us to start getting into that so first of all very basic question why is it time to start getting into it and second of all what does that mean you would want to do pete buttigieg yes well first of all let me be clear my party has done a much better job of fiscal responsibility than the other party i believe it s true that every single presidency in my lifetime that has been democratic has seen a reduction in the deficit and the reverse is true with every single republican presidency in my lifetime as we speak we have a republican presidency cheering a scenario where we ve got a trillion dollar deficit but i find that our party doesn t talk about it much and in some corners of our party it s not fashionable to care about it i think that we need to first of all because just generationally i think that i may be here when some of these fiscal time bombs go off i also think that we need to recognize that we re approaching a point where you can t ignore spending we need to do on infrastructure and safety net and health and education being crowded by debt service i m not one of those who would say that deficits can never play a role i m saying that we ve taken our eye off of them as a country and as the party that between the two parties has done a better job handling it when in power we should own this we should talk about it we shouldn t be afraid to talk about it because it does matter and what what we ve seen is that this deficit was created in my view not by an excess of investment in our social democratic institutions but by enormous tax cuts for the wealthy and the total real world collapse of the theory that those tax cuts pay for themselves is one of the most important things that happened in the last 40 years that should be held in mind by everybody making policy for the next 40 ruth marcus so is your theory as president of addressing the deficit that it s a raise taxes solution pete buttigieg well given that we re underinvesting and that it s either got to happen on the cost side or i mean i think we can find more efficiencies as you always do when you assess various programs but fundamentally this is a revenue problem and part of how i m trying to make good on what i say on the trail is our campaign will always have pay fors for everything i propose i mean the stuff i m proposing isn t cheap right you line up everything we ve talked about with health education housing and so on and we re in the neighborhood of 6 to 7 trillion over a decade now that s dramatically less than my competitors because i do care about making sure i m making promises we can keep if the margin of error in the disagreements over the cost of your health care plan is equivalent to the entire united states gdp i think that s a problem right so it s one of the reasons why it does matter that my health care plan over a decade is 1 5 trillion instead of 20 or 40 depending on who you listen to but we re also gonna have to raise the revenue and the good news is we can without going to some eisenhower level taxation system without doing anything that s incompatible with robust economic growth by doing things like rolling back the trump tax cuts ensuring there is a higher reasonable but definitely higher marginal tax rate on income by reforming the way we handle capital gains in this country by closing other loopholes like the 199a loophole by better enforcing what we ve got we can raise just as much revenue as it s going to cost to do any of the things i m saying ruth marcus you can raise revenue to pay for the new things you want to do but that doesn t address your fiscal time bomb pete buttigieg so everything i m talking about should collectively be deficit reducing or deficit neutral taken together we don t know because some of this is cyclical some could happen but fundamentally on the whole it will be deficit reducing stephen stromberg so one of your efficiencies that you identified one of your pay fors is negotiating with pharmaceutical companies on prescription drug costs how would you ensure that those negotiations actually yielded the reductions in costs that you predict pete buttigieg well first of all we ve got to make sure that we have a minimum number of areas where those negotiations take place high volume and high need drugs so that even under a republican administration that might not have the same enthusiasm for these negotiations that i would that there s a floor the other thing to remember is that it is in the interest of well regulated pharmaceutical companies to make sure that they re at the table and participating in these negotiations and we are going to need remedies as a backstop if there is a lack of good faith it s why we need to have as i ve proposed controls on runaway price increases that are faster than the rate of inflation that can t be justified by something like an ingredient shortage which we know is happening all the time a company s doing this not because it s part of how they fund innovation not because they have to but because they can and so negotiation is part of it but only part of it when it comes to what we ve got to do to reduce those runaway price increases stephen stromberg so what s the backstop i mean do you set a price you know legislatively do you legislate some kind of arbitration system if the negotiations fail maybe you re talking about a new drug that there s no preexisting price and so you can t really say it s runaway price because there s nothing to compare it to pete buttigieg right the inflation backstop or the inflation kind of safety valve that s about things that are brought to market and then making sure that they can t be gouged stephen stromberg exactly pete buttigieg it s certainly more complicated in terms of new therapies although i think that the newest therapies are not the ones we re talking about the most right now in terms of families suffering right when you hear about what s going on with insulin insulin is not an exotic invention anymore there are some policy design questions around how to make sure the negotiations work well but we can t even get to those policy design questions if we remain in a world where in principle it s prevented from happening in the first place fred hiatt just to come back to ruth s question on the deficit and the debt we certainly agree that it s an issue but we get a lot of pushback now saying look because the republicans have shown they don t care and they just did what they want democrats if they regain power why should they be saps and limit themselves in important things like infrastructure and health care and education let s go for it do you hear that and why is that wrong pete buttigieg my point is that we can do the big things i m proposing without an irresponsible outcome on the fiscal side if we re willing to raise revenue and by the way raising revenue is something the american people are ready to do when i talk about this american majority that exists i m not talking about a consensus but where maybe more than 60 percent territory on most of this stuff on pretty much everything we re proposing to do from health to a higher minimum wage to paid family leave to even gun legislation and a pathway to citizenship and immigration these are things the american people support it s actually very hard to find something in the kind of boldface items on the republican platform that the american people are on balance or for fred hiatt how about climate the carbon tax and dividend pete buttigieg if we do the dividend right then most americans will experience it the same way we experience the bush tax cut as a check in the mail now the dividend formula should be progressive so that we make sure most americans are more than made whole anyway as you know from my democratic reform agenda i also believe that we should push on things that we need to make the case for that maybe aren t popular but my point is especially when it comes to taxing corporations and the wealthy there is a strong majority for this among the american people it s the american congress where we re having trouble salwan georges the washington post christine emba on that note you mentioned just a few moments ago that you want to raise revenue but we don t have to go back to eisenhower level taxes talk to me about that what s wrong with that exactly or why is that something that you are opposed to or think that the american people would be opposed to it if they re so open pete buttigieg well i think when you start hearing about marginal income tax rates pushing into the 70 80 90 percent range it starts to feel unreasonable admittedly some of this is about how these things strike us more than you can compute by definition you can t compute a number that officially is reasonable but i think we have an intuition i think we know it when we see it and i think most of us would say 90 percent taxes is a little much but i also think most of us know that what s happening here when amazon forgive me or fedex pays less in federal income tax than you and i did specifically zero we know something is dramatically wrong with the system i think that the problem has become that sometimes taxation is being talked about in isolation like what should the tax be rather than what do we need to do and how are we going to pay for it it would be like if you re buying a car and you say a number without looking at the car without even knowing what make or whether it s a truck or a sedan or what color it is just going off the number most people think about cost and what you get for that cost in the same thought and yet we re talking about taxation as if there s just some intrinsically morally right and wrong level of taxes what we need is a fair way that distributes the burden of funding all the things that we need in order to have a thriving country and what we know is that right now the burden is way out of whack and proportionately lower and middle income americans relative to wealthy americans corporations are shouldering far too much of that burden christine emba so if 90 is high and zero is low and say that you re the president and your job is to galvanize people towards some correct intuition or some number that s helpful what are you thinking actually like what is your perspective as to what would be fair that you would then presumably be trying to convince america pete buttigieg so i think on the income piece as a matter just kind of common sense or intuition i think it s best to keep it below 50 percent as a marginal rate on income we re still crunching numbers on a couple of things i ve not yet released on the spending side and again i view taxation as something that s supposed to correspond to spending versus something in itself so i don t have the marginal rate handy for you right now that i think we re going to land on but what i ll tell you is that reforming the capital gains tax system including some kind of mark to market reform so that it keeps pace some kind of financial transactions tax these are all part of a broad portfolio that collectively have the effect of making sure that the corporations and the wealthy people who own them are shouldering a greater share of the burden jackson diehl deputy editorial page editor is some of that going to entitlements so you have a plan to stabilize entitlements medicare and medicaid pete buttigieg yeah first of all on social security the reality is that you only have to make a couple of moves one of which is to collect past the 250 000 level on payroll taxes to have the social security trust fund be just fine well into the years when i expect to be drawing on it and without any cuts of benefits similarly on the health side and this is part of the bigger question about how we responsibly fund health care in this country because last i saw i think that the medicare negotiation move alone amounts to something on the order of 300 to 400 billion over a decade per cbo there is more than enough to work with to make sure that we are funding our health care needs now that being said there s also a lot of reform that has to happen to publicly administered health care plans we know that cms could be more efficient we know in the new machine age the number of human hands that have to touch a prior authorization probably ought to be zero and i have not yet met a doctor who s living in that reality so medicare as we know it just growing that is not enough we of course need to make improvements but i don t think those improvements need to come at the expense of patient care fred hiatt another one of your spending items or some of them are contained in the douglass plan one of the premises of which is just because we ve fixed the rules we haven t undone the effects of years or centuries of oppression which is also the premise that people who support flat out reparations but you don t go there and i wonder why not pete buttigieg well i do support h r 40 for the same reason fred hiatt a commission pete buttigieg yeah now the commission will have to wrestle with complex questions about how to do this and i don t think we should wait for the commission to deliver policies that are reparative including with resources whether it s the 50 billion that ought to go into hbcus for all kinds of reasons or the targeted funding for health equity or any of the other things that we ve proposed in the douglass plan but my basic thinking on this is that we all recognize that if you save a buck at 5 percent it ll turn into 2 in four and eight it actually turns into a 1 000 over 150 years and if that s true of a dollar saved it s true of a dollar stolen and it s part of why these harms and inequities will compound if left alone and colorblind policies or neutral policies may on their face be a lot better than a nakedly racist policy but they re not going to be enough to deliver equity and that is what part of the motivation of the douglass plan has in common with the move toward reparations lee hockstader editorial writer you said that there s an american majority for path to citizenship but you also know and you ve said often that that has to be part of a grand bargain on immigration and like other democrats you talked about doing daca path to citizenship and generally no more kids in cages no more breaking up families but you ve also said the first thing we have to do is border security you said that to newsweek what does border security mean to you pete buttigieg well it s a hell of a lot different than what you see right now it doesn t involve family separation it doesn t involve the kinds of detention conditions we re seeing i would argue it shouldn t involve cbp in the business of housing anybody at all i would shift that to health and human services because an enforcement agency doesn t have the setup to be taking care of people i would argue that there should not be such a thing as a for profit detention center for children of course we have a border and we will continue to have a border and we will maintain our border that s part of being a country but a lot of what needs to happen include technological changes training improvements and we ve got a president right now whose understanding of security technology even though we re living in the 21st century his understanding of security technology is 17th century it s a wall a moat full of alligators it s these literally medieval ideas that don t really reflect the reality that we re living in and are not going to serve to make us safer lee hockstader but affirmatively what do you do what do the democrats do to take away the magnet to take away what the president calls catch and release what he says are all these loopholes in the current policy that acts as the magnet for migrants to come pete buttigieg well first all we got to look at root causes right so the current trend with migration has a lot less than it used to do with seeking opportunity and a lot of it now is seeking safety and i always think of the interview with i think a salvadoran migrant who said i m not even after the american dream i m just fleeing a nightmare which is why if we want to talk about really dealing with what s called the magnet i would say we re dealing with the push that has people concluding that their lives and their children s lives depend on them fleeing the country they live in as long as that s true we re going to have migration challenges no matter how you set up the border and it s why we have a national interest in supporting central american triangle countries it s why this punitive idea of cutting funding to central american countries is perfectly wrong it s exactly the opposite of what we should do but also it s why we need to make sure that our hemisphere is prosperous frankly if mexico became more secure and prosperous that would also have an effect not just on migration of folks from mexico but what folks from central america would do it s not going to be an easy fix here but what we know is that each of the steps that this administration has taken has increased the level of fear and division and suffering and not at all increased level of security at the border or in the country karen tumulty would you do anything to refine the criteria for asylum pete buttigieg first of all we ve got to recognize that asylum is a right and what we ve seen is a move away from some justifications for asylum in terms of safety and and oppression and harm that i believe do belong in those criteria as much as possible we should work to harmonize those criteria internationally so that this is consistent with international law but it begins with the simple recognition that when somebody is seeking asylum they re not trying to get a favor they re asserting as is their right something under international law lee hockstader is it also a right for asylum seekers to cross into the united states and wait for asylum in the united states as they apply pete buttigieg because we know we can handle that i mean you look at things like the family case management program virtually everybody in it showed up when they were supposed to for their appointments so the remain in mexico policy again may have a political benefit to this president but it doesn t really correspond to reality fred hiatt let s do another reader question your only government executive experience is being mayor of a relatively small indiana city how is that enough or relevant to make you qualified to become the leader of the most powerful nation in the world pete buttigieg so it is a leap to go from any job to the presidency it should be humbling for anybody contemplating it or competing for it i also wonder though if i would get that same question if i were a legislator here in washington if i were a senator or a member of congress and with all due respect for what goes on on capitol hill you could be a very senior senator in our country and have never in your life been responsible for more than a hundred people in terms of day to day management and so part of what i would say is that when you re a mayor of a city of any size you not only have the experience of making policy which is what legislators do you also have the experience of managing an administration and balancing the budget right we don t get to print money or have the kinds of deficits that washington can at the city level but not only that you also have the responsibility of guiding a population and you realize through that work that often where you earn your paycheck is in functions that are not described or written down anywhere they have to do with the tone you set and in the case of south bend the work that had to happen to get the city to believe in itself after being told at the beginning of this decade that it was dying that kind of experience not to mention the experience of being sent to war on the orders of a president and having that particular understanding of the gravity of the decisions that are made in the situation i would argue is as good experience as any for the leap that again faces anybody going from any job that isn t the president s into the oval office ruth marcus can i ask you about this supreme court you have an innovative idea of five republican appointed justices five democratic appointed justices five chosen by consensus from the justices themselves that seems to presuppose that the optimal court is a kind of consensus court that has some kind of equal ish division in it is that your goal or is your goal a liberal supreme court pete buttigieg so the supreme court will become more liberal in my presidency because my justices that i would appoint would have a philosophy that s more consistent with my own that s different from the questions i think we need to deal with through institutional reform that s about securing for the next century a court where the political stakes of appointments change what we have now are these apocalyptic ideological firefights every time there s a vacancy we have the spectacle of people seeming to feel compelled to time their departure from the bench or or even time their departure from the earth according to who s in power at the time and there s something grotesque about that because supreme court justices used to just retire like anybody else and the stakes have changed so that even people who might want to can t or we re not in a normal environment let s put it that way and changing that will have all kinds of benefits not only in terms of the nominating process but things like these very idiosyncratic briefing patterns where you brief the supreme court of the united states not based on the most compelling legal arguments you can think of but based on the idiosyncrasies of a single person considered to be the swing justice and so there are all kinds of things that we can do to make that process more just more healthy through a move to reduce the political stakes charles lane i just wanted to follow up not on this when you said you were deployed on the orders of the president i got momentarily triggered and let me explain why because as you well know tim kaine and others have been talking for some time about the extraordinarily tenuous relationship that now exists between the original authorization for all these deployments pete buttigieg yes charles lane and the actual deployments and the discussion of syria earlier kind of took it for granted that it was kind of up to the next president to put troops kind of where they want i just wanted to address that as somebody who aspires to be president would you be open to something many of your predecessors of both parties have not been which is engaging with congress about dialing back to some extent the latitude that presidents have to make these kinds of long term deployments pete buttigieg absolutely another of the things that strikes me in looking at what s been revealed in the afghanistan papers is just the extent to which the american people have not really participated or been reasoned with in terms of the big decisions about this conflict at least not in the right ways and so i think it s so important that congress have its role and i imagine congress would hesitate to embrace that role because this is so difficult but one thing that i ve committed to is that we would have a three year sunset built in into an aumf so that if as president i concluded that we really did need to extend an on the ground engagement past three years it will be necessary for me to go back to congress and convince them to and it would be necessary for them to weigh in and take the tough up or down vote on whether that s the right thing to do charles lane do you think we need a new one for syria pete buttigieg i think that we need a new one overall past the original post 9 11 one i mean we have troops in east africa in 2019 based on an authorization passed to deal with what happened in 2001 after we lost troops in niger a lot of members of congress admitted not realizing we were even there so i do think the time has come to redefine the scope of our missions and our engagements knowing that dealing with al qaeda is not exactly what is being expected of a lot of the troops on these deployments fred hiatt we re running short on time and i wanted to ask you one question from your book something that stuck with me where you said you often think about going back in time to the south bend of the 60s or 40s or 20s and that when you got there at first you would feel nostalgia and envy but soon you would feel pity for the people there because any of them would be better off in the south bend of today why so and are the people in south bend better off than they were in the 90s or 10 years ago talk about that a little bit pete buttigieg to me this is the core falsehood of make america great again it s that the nostalgia for the past evokes a time that for so many was not as great as advertised and that simply turning that clock wouldn t make us better off so i described in the book how it would feel especially coming from a city that had a heyday and that heyday ended so by many conventional measures our city was dramatically better off in the 20s or in the 40s it was growing it was more fashionable and by the measures of that time it was more prosperous but people were living shorter lives there was a level of racial exclusion that is different than today obviously a gay mayor like me wouldn t have that much of a chance there are so many ways in which we should be glad even as we look at the loss that happened as a city like ours was abandoned by its original industrial titans still progress matters progress is real progress happened and that s why we can t just turn back the clock i certainly believe in the progress in our city in this decade i think most people in our city would agree we started the decade fending off accounts that we were dying and now we are growing it s okay to believe in the city it s not just the things i can measure in terms of unemployment job creation poverty and investment it s the fact that you can just feel that the city believes in itself it s part of what i mean we talk about the relationship between mayor s goals and the presidency it s harder to quantify but it s no less important ruth marcus and i just i wanted to follow up on your question because i really didn t quite understand it it does seem like the structure that you re setting up does envision a closely divided court is a closely divided court better or worse for the country than a overwhelmingly liberal court pete buttigieg will it be closely divided i m not sure we can expect that naturally as a long run outcome i think it s possible in the short run ruth marcus five five and five seems to suggest that pete buttigieg well it depends what s happening among the five but the whole idea is that they were seated by consensus so the terms of predictable even tribal division among the first five and the second five may not obtain in the third five this is the experience of local government where we have democrats and republicans back home too in office and we have ferocious political divisions but the difference is they re not as entrenched the person that i came this close to just letting them have it because they were creating all kinds of problems as a legislator for me on one issue becomes the swing vote allowing my budget to pass the next year these things typically happened in healthier moments in our democracy sometimes it involved crossing party lines sometimes it involved crossing regional lines the fault lines have been there they ve been different they ve shifted but the real problem i think is the extent to which these lines have now been encrusted in our expectations of the judiciary so the intent of this reform is not to get a court that agrees with me more my appointments will be to a court that agrees with me more but the intent of this reform is to set up for the next hundred years a court that we can look to as standing apart from the political process fred hiatt anything you wish we d asked you pete buttigieg i got all kinds of softballs you could have asked me no i appreciate the chance to be here and i think that there is a sense of urgency right now that we need to understand that goes beyond just the urgency that we feel about dealing with trump and trumpism it s dealing with forces that made someone like him possible and when i talk about exchanging the american experience of exclusion for one to belong and fit that with all of the concrete policy changes i believe need to be made this is what i have in mind and this i believe is what has made it possible for a candidacy as unlikely as mine to get this far we re going to need to do a lot of work both to deliver big bold changes and to have a country that s more unified than we are we cannot achieve one without the other if we skip one step the other will collapse and yet i think we can do it i think we have the values to do it i think enough of the american people are ready for it and under the right presidential leadership more of the american people will become ready for it and that s why i m sitting here and that s why i m running for president fred hiatt thank you pete buttigieg thanks conversations with the post editorial board michael bennet 2020 presidential candidate deval patrick 2020 presidential candidate andrew

monday s mid year budget update will be a humiliating admission from the morrison government that economic growth will be slower and wages growth weaker on its watch according to labor the morrison government will on monday unveil the latest mid year economic and fiscal outlook delivering the last major set piece event for the political year while the government will use the scheduled update to trumpet its economic management credentials pointing to a forecast surplus as well as accounting for additional spending on drought relief and aged care the shadow treasurer jim chalmers has declared the coalition finishes 2019 with a big f for fail on the economy monday s update is expected to confirm another downgrade in wages growth chalmers said the average australian full time worker was now 2 200 a year worse off than the government said they would be because their wages have been so stagnant he said low wages growth had become the new normal no matter how hard people work they just can t seem to get ahead because they ve got skyrocketing costs for childcare electricity and private health insurance and the government just doesn t seem to give a stuff about them certainly not enough to come up with a comprehensive plan to get things moving again chalmers said the finance minister mathias cormann rejected labor s arguments real wages growth which is wages growth above inflation is stronger than it was when labor lost government the economy is facing some global economic headwinds some domestic challenges in the context of the drought in particular but our economy continues to grow our wages continue to grow faster than inflation and the growth in disposable income across australia is the fastest it has been in more than a decade cormann said chalmers acknowledged that global headwinds like the trade dispute between the united states and china was part of the reason the domestic economy was underperforming but he insisted the issues in our economy are principally home grown they are a function of a government that doesn t have a plan to turn things around annual growth now is slower than what it was at the election slower than what it was when morrison and frydenberg took over and slower than it was when labor was in office he said the government told voters it was adept at managing the economy when the facts tell a very different story whether it s the facts about growth wages productivity household debt or public debt which has more than doubled right across the board this government finishes the year with a big f for fail on the economy a debate has played out for much of the year about whether the morrison government has done enough to stimulate the sluggish economy while the government has insisted it has got the balance right and has made a virtue of not launching a panicked fiscal response in late november the prime minister confirmed it would spend an extra 3 8bn on infrastructure projects over the next four years the decision to bring forward infrastructure investment followed calls from labor the international monetary fund and the reserve bank for the government to provide more fiscal stimulus amid slowing growth and record low interest rates the government had hoped that the provision of tax cuts would trigger increased consumption but the latest official economic growth figures suggest consumers remain reluctant to spend the economy grew by just 0 4 in the september quarter and 1 7 for the year according to the australian bureau of statistics household gross disposable income increased by 2 5 due to the tax cuts and lower mortgage repayments after three interest rate cuts this year but households did not choose to boost spending instead discretionary spending fell 0 3 and the savings ratio rose to 4 8
a new era is underway in which national interests take primacy photo 123rf the notion that global economic integration amounts to human progress had a good run dominating the thinking of the powers that be for more than seven decades but a new era is underway in which national interests take primacy over collective concerns with trading arrangements negotiated among individual countries britain s voters made that clear thursday in handing an emphatic majority to prime minister boris johnson and his conservative party all but ensuring that the world s fifth largest economy and a charter member of the international trading system will proceed with its abandonment of the european union a preliminary deal hailed friday by the two largest economies the us and china raised the prospect of easing their high stakes trade animosities but the nature of their engagement country to country not mediated by the world trade organisation or some other international authority underscored the principles of the new age britain now faces another complex phase in its tangled european divorce proceedings negotiations over the terms of its future economic relationship with the continent but in one form or another getting brexit done the mantra that johnson promised and can now deliver marks a profound change in the world trading system in the aftermath of world war ii the victorious allies built an international order on the understanding that when countries swap goods they become less inclined to trade artillery volleys britain s departure from the eu is the clearest manifestation that this idea no longer holds decisive sway it is not the only one the traditional arbiter of international trade disputes the wto is listing toward irrelevance as countries bypass its channels to impose tariffs its appellate body which adjudicates disputes has been rendered inoperative by the trump administration s blocking of new judges the panel needs at least three judges to render verdicts but now has only one the sense that policy moves in one direction toward more liberalisation and more integration has been replaced by recognition that policy can go backward as well as forward said brad setser a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations in new york the us and china together account for more than a third of the global economy making their wave of escalating tariffs a cause for alarm about diminishing fortunes in nearly every country exposed to international trade from germany to south korea to mexico president donald trump has put stock in the unrivaled scale of the us economy in seeking favorable trading arrangements in his calculus the us boasts the advantage in any bilateral trade negotiations and can tilt the rules toward american interests british prime minister boris johnson photo ap this was the logic that prompted trump to renounce us participation in the trans pacific partnership a trade bloc spanning a dozen countries it was a project pursued by his immediate predecessor president barack obama in part to press china to address long standing complaints that it subsidised key industries doled out credit to favoured companies and manipulated the value of its currency to gain advantage in world markets in taking on china the obama administration employed the multilateralist mindset that had guided us policy since the end of world war ii the pacific trading bloc would set rules on investment labor and environmental standards its members would profit through growing trade and china would want in to gain access china would be forced to adopt the bloc s rules but in trumpian thinking multilateralism is for suckers shortly after he was sworn in declaring as his credo america first trump ditched the pacific bloc and weaponised the us market if china wanted access to the 327 million consumers in the richest country on earth it would have to buy more american goods and play fair friday trump cited the preliminary agreement as evidence that his strategy was working the us would sharply reduce the tariffs it had affixed to chinese goods while china promised to buy more american farm products and respect intellectual property trump called it an amazing deal for all but economists said the announcement of new farm purchases reflected goods that china was already buying even as the scrapping of the next wave of tariffs weighed as positive for the global economy few were proclaiming the advent of enduring peace the us and china have descended into such an adversarial state that they are likely to continue seeking alternatives to exchanging goods and investment companies that make goods in china will face pressure to explore other countries posing disruption to the global supply chain china s leaders have come to construe trade hostilities as part of an american bullying campaign engineered to suppress their national aspirations and deny the country its rightful place as a superpower nationalist sentiments and security concerns have become intertwined with trade policy complicating the pursuit of a final deal now britain in leaving the european bloc embarks on a strategy aimed at securing bilateral trading arrangements with major economies from the us and china to australia and india trade deals are complex and difficult they entail prying open new markets for exports in exchange for exposing domestic companies to new competitors powerful interest groups complain deals take years arithmetic reveals that no combination of trade deals is likely to compensate britain fully for what it stands to lose in walking away from the european single marketplace a territory stretching from greece to ireland britain sends nearly half of its exports to the eu a flow of goods imperiled by brexit britain s appeal as a headquarters for multinational companies will be undermined as it finds itself separated from the continent by a revived border the fraying of international trading arrangements and the rise of nationalist imperatives have been driven by intensifying public anger in many countries over widening economic inequality and the perception that trade has been bountiful for the executive class while leaving ordinary people behind in britain struggling communities used the june 2016 referendum that unleashed brexit as a protest vote against the bankers in london who had engineered a catastrophic financial crisis and who then forced regular people to absorb the costs through wrenching fiscal austerity in the us trump s political base has rallied to his trade war in italy france and germany furious popular movements have fixed on trade as a threat to workers livelihoods while embracing nationalist and nativist responses that promise to halt globalisation the era of freewheeling markets and liberalism is ending said meredith crowley an international trade expert at the university of cambridge in england people are dissatisfied with the complexity of policy and this feeling that those who have the levers of policy are somehow out of their reach economists see perils in this unfolding era especially as governments champion national industries at the expense of competition they point to history notably the great depression which was deepened by a wave of tit for tat trade protectionism kicked off by the us through the smoot hawley tariff act of 1930 the law sharply raised tariffs on a vast range of agricultural and factory goods prompting us trading partners to respond as world trade disintegrated nationalist rage spread culminating in the brutalities of world war ii the british election and the splintering of the european trading bloc amounts to the most consequential upsurge of economic nationalism in generations since smoot hawley i don t think we have seen something as dramatic as this said swati dhingra an economist at the london school of economics one major variable has gained clarity congressional democrats and the trump administration this week hailed an accord that clears passage of the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement the deal that has allowed some us 1 2 trillion 1 8t worth of goods a year to be exchanged freely across the us canada and mexico an overview of the port of dover england dover is a crucial passageway in britain s trade with europe photo andrew testa new york times yet on another front trump has threatened to impose tariffs on imported automobiles a step that would be especially disruptive in germany europe s largest economy germany sells far more goods to the us than it imports drawing the ire of the american president trump has openly warned that he could cite a national security threat as justification for auto tariffs trade experts have derided that strategy as an affront to the norms of the international trading system last month trump allowed a self imposed deadline to lapse without imposing auto tariffs but he has left a major international industry guessing about what happens next since britain shocked the world with its vote to abandon the eu its political institutions have tangled themselves in knots trying to decide what to do with their nebulous mandate to leave businesses have deferred hiring and investments awaiting clarity on future trading terms the uncertainty has already exacted significant costs and far beyond europe according to a new paper by tarek hassan an economist at boston university and three european accounting experts stephan hollander laurence van lent and ahmed tahoun every year since the referendum the average company in ireland which trades heavily with britain has seen its growth in investment reduced by 4 2 per cent and hiring is 15 per cent less than it otherwise would have been because of uncertainty the paper concludes yet even across the atlantic the average us company has seen investment growth limited by 0 5 per cent a year and hiring slowed by 1 7 per cent there is already a significant drop in employment as a result of the risks of brexit hassan said some analysts suggested that the election enhanced the possibility that johnson would pursue a softer form of brexit keeping britain closer to the european market his majority is so comfortable that he need not worry about alienating the hard liners in his party who favour a clean break with europe but some alteration now lies ahead if brexit uncertainty has been damaging what replaces it is the near certainty of weaker economic growth and diminished living standards it s going to have massive implications hassan said written by

federal tax breaks and subsidies for the aforementioned projects include having the companies pay prevailing wages and that the iron steel and cement used in their construction be from u s suppliers i

vladimir lenin s debunked conspiracy theories are repeated and public servants testifying under oath about documented events are dismissed as never trumpers unable to change the facts trump and his supporters instead try to shift the debate into an alternate universe where the truth is whatever they say it is today trump repeats the same lies over and over and it s hard to say which is more troubling that his followers don t realize that they are lies or that they don t care trump has been fortunate that much of his fervent base much prefers watching fox news and listening to right wing talk radio to well reading and research i m curious about how many of trump s congressional backers are simply cowards afraid of being attacked by him if they dare criticize their boss and or have

if you re interested in the energy industry you might be most interested in the giant oil companies or maybe in green energy options like solar and wind however don t forget about oil s cleaner burning cousin natural gas the gas industry and the oil industry go hand in hand and many oil companies also produce gas and vice versa but unlike oil the global gas industry and particularly the u s gas sector has changed a lot over the past few years with more changes in store investors in the know could reap huge rewards from this often overlooked sector here s what you need to know before you invest in this interesting corner of the energy world what are gas stocks gas stocks are simply put stocks in companies that deal with natural gas and its derivatives because natural gas and oil are often found together in wells many gas companies are also oil companies and the entire sector is sometimes referred to as the oil and gas sector we ll discuss this more later but many gas stocks aren t actually stocks at all the master limited partnership mlp structure is very common in this sector notable gas stocks include oil majors like exxonmobil nyse xom and royal dutch shell nyse rds a nyse rds b all of which have both oil and gas drilling operations and all of which have both oil and gas drilling operations independent oil and gas exploration and production companies like antero

helpful to know which type of gas is which what is dry gas dry gas refers to natural gas that s in a gaseous form and not a liquid form it s what we usually mean when we refer to gas or natural gas most of the gas produced today is dry gas which is also the type that is pumped into your home by your gas utility it s also the kind that s most commonly found flowing through u s gas pipelines even though dry gas is naturally occurring it still needs to be processed before it can be used to remove impurities and separate different types of gas from one another because natural gas primarily consists of methane ch4 the simplest hydrocarbon which is a colorless odorless gas it has a rotten egg smell artificially added to it before it gets distributed by a utility so gas leaks can be more easily detected dry gas is often found in combination with other hydrocarbons gas and oil are usually found in the same wells and pockets of dry gas are also quite common in coal seams the proverbial canary in the coal mine was used to detect the colorless odorless methane before it could spark an explosion what are ngls ngls stands for natural gas liquids these are types of simple hydrocarbons that occur naturally in liquid form not to get too science y but the more carbon atoms in a hydrocarbon molecule the less pressure needs to be applied to turn it into a liquid methane ch4 and ethane c2h6 are very difficult to turn into liquids and appear in gaseous form even under the ground where pressure is high the two best known ngls are propane c3h8 and butane c4h10 which are gaseous at room temperature and pressure but can be fairly easily liquefied other ngls include the less common pentane c5h12 and hexane c6h14 which are liquid at room temperature ngls are usually separated from dry gas after they are drilled in a process called fractionation but are then primarily stored and transported in their liquid forms it s important to understand that ngls are not oil and vice versa oil is a liquid but tends to be comprised of more complex hydrocarbons as opposed to the simpler varieties that make up natural gas oil also contains various impurities that keep it in liquid form and give it its unique dark color and texture because of their simple structure and lack of impurities ngls are considered to be cleaner fuels than oil or its derivatives what is lng lng stands for liquefied natural gas which is different from ngls lng is dry gas that has been supercooled to negative 260 degrees fahrenheit brrr to reduce its volume and make it easier to transport liquefying gas reduces its volume by about 600 times and also makes it less volatile so it can be transported by ship today the largest lng tankers can hold nearly 9 4 million cubic feet of lng that s the equivalent of roughly 5 6 billion cubic feet of dry gas fun fact the first documented lng production occurred during world war i the u s government wanted to extract helium from dry gas to use in british dirigibles so it liquefied gas from the municipal gas system extracted the helium and then immediately regassified it and put it back into the pipes we ve come a long way since then other types of gas obviously there are plenty of other substances that take a gaseous form the aforementioned helium for example but while these can be important commodities we don t refer to the companies that manufacture or refine them as gas stocks one sometime exception is carbon dioxide co2 a by product of power generation and some industrial production which is used in oilfields as well as for refrigeration and cooling co2 is often piped long distances through pipeline networks that are owned by gas pipeline companies for example the 502 mile cortez pipeline in the west texas permian basin carries co2 but is operated by gas pipeline operator kinder morgan but it would be rare for a carbon dioxide pipeline to just be referred to as a gas pipeline even though it s transporting co2 in a gaseous state and is run by a gas pipeline company finally of course there s gas as in gasoline which is actually refined from oil the companies that refine and sell gasoline like valero or phillips 66 are usually considered part of the oil industry as opposed to the gas industry although many of the largest oil majors like exxonmobil produce and refine both oil and gas how does the gas industry work natural gas takes a long and complex journey from the ground to your gas stove or propane tank like the oil industry companies in the gas industry are divided into three streams depending on where they fall in that journey upstream exploration and production upstream companies are responsible for finding the gas and extracting it from under the ground they use a variety of techniques to explore for oil and gas often using seismology to send shock waves into the ground and interpret the resulting seismic vibrations to look for underground pockets of liquid which could be oil or ngls or gas this can occur on land or underwater once a company believes it has discovered a deposit of gas it drills an exploration well to see if there are in fact hydrocarbons in the deposit and of what kind and quality they are if the results from the exploration well are positive the company will drill an additional well or wells on the site to begin extracting the gas this begins the production phase what to look for in an upstream gas company when evaluating an upstream company one should not only look at its production level how much gas and oil it s producing but also its production costs how much the company has to pay to extract one barrel of oil equivalent boe or thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent mcfe from the ground sometimes a company that produces less gas at a lower cost can be a better buy than a company producing a lot of gas at a high cost another consideration is the company s estimated reserves how much gas and oil remain in the fields from which the company is producing because gas is a finite resource companies need to continually drill new wells and find new reserves to replace the gas they extract gas prices are probably the biggest factor affecting upstream gas companies when gas prices go down producers margins go down which affects their bottom lines midstream transportation and storage once the gas is extracted from the well it needs to be transported and stored this is usually done via pipeline companies that own these pipelines and storage terminals are known as midstream companies midstream facilities also include fractionation plants to separate ngls from dry gas and liquefaction plants to convert dry gas to lng that s a bit different than the oil industry in which refining is generally considered part of downstream operations finally midstream gas companies can also operate export terminals where lng is loaded onto tanker ships for transport overseas what to look for in a midstream gas company for pipeline companies major considerations for investors include the size and location of a company s pipeline network companies with larger networks of pipelines that connect major production centers to key population centers or export terminals have advantages of scale and volume companies that operate pipelines along high demand routes that have limited pipeline capacity can also command a premium for their services quality of pipeline is also important a large diameter long distance pipeline is generally more lucrative than a gathering system consisting of small pipes connecting a network of wells even though the gathering system may boast more miles of pipe looking at a company s growth plans to see what projects it has in the works is also important as it gives clues into how well the company may fare in the future but be aware that big infrastructure projects like these are faced with numerous logistical hurdles and regulatory challenges not to mention potential opposition from people who live near the project sites investors should also take a look at what percentage of a midstream company s income is reliable either from fee based contracts or regulated assets the higher the percentage of reliable income the less likely it is that the company will experience an unexpected cash flow problem because midstream companies are infrastructure companies they often have high debt levels thanks to the upfront investments required to build long pipelines and large terminals before those assets begin generating revenue investors should expect debt levels of multiple times ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization however a debt level of more than four times ebitda is starting to look high even for a midstream company checking the company s debt rating from one of the major ratings agencies like moody s or fitch ratings can help give you an idea of how well the company is managing its debt load midstream mlps a different beast many midstream companies are organized as master limited partnerships mlps while investing in an mlp is very similar to investing in a regular corporation investors in mlps own units not stock shares and the partnerships pay distributions rather than dividends more importantly for investors mlps are given certain tax advantages in exchange for paying out most of their cash flow as distributions to their unitholders what to look for in a midstream mlp investors buying mlps are usually looking for high distribution yields and most midstream mlps are happy to oblige however it s important to make sure that an mlp has sufficient coverage for its distribution in general a coverage ratio of 1 2 times that is distributable cash flow that equals 1 2 times the total distribution payout or more is considered safe if an mlp or any company for that matter falls below a coverage ratio of 1 0 it is paying out more in distributions than it is generating in cash and it will have to make up the difference by taking on additional debt selling assets issuing new units or cutting its payout for mlps with already high debt loads this can be a tricky situation to navigate and rarely ends well for unitholders it s important to look at an mlp s record of distribution increases and cuts the best ones will have long multi year track records of quarterly or annual increases and no cuts one final note about mlps because of their unique tax structure they often require investors to file additional paperwork at taxtime in some cases they may not be compatible with certain types of accounts particularly tax advantaged retirement accounts like roth iras be sure to brush up on how mlp ownership may affect your situation before buying in downstream refining and marketing downstream oil companies refine petroleum into gasoline or petrochemicals and sell it either to consumers or in the case of petrochemicals to industrial customers the bulk of refining activities in the energy sector is the refining of crude oil although some petrochemicals are refined from ngls most gas processing including fractionation and purification is handled by midstream companies because we re talking gas and not oil we re not going to spend much time discussing this oil dominated subsector although there are plenty of integrated oil and gas companies that operate in this space in their oil businesses speaking of integrated companies integrated companies an integrated oil and gas company is a company that operates in multiple streams usually such companies operate in all three streams these include the five oil majors so called big oil exxonmobil royal dutch shell bp nyse bp chevron nyse cvx and total nyse tot this also includes the lone major integrated gas company that doesn t deal with oil at all the russian gas giant gazprom some smaller gas companies operate in multiple streams as well producers that also transport and export gas include the up and coming tellurian which is focused on exporting lng when evaluating an integrated company you need to look at the whole company s operations upstream midstream and downstream whichever apply often these companies fare better than non integrated companies especially in times of low gas and oil prices because their refining and marketing arms which are less susceptible to price swings can offset struggling production arms likewise a company with midstream operations that generate plenty of reliable cash can use that cash to cover its dividend payouts even when times are tough other types of gas companies oilfield services companies usually thought of as part of the oil industry oilfield services companies like schlumberger and halliburton provide what s often referred to as picks and shovels for oil and gas production companies today though those picks and shovels are more likely to take the form of drill bits and logistics software because most oil wells also produce some gas and vice versa oilfield services companies can also be considered part of the gas industry one major subset of services companies that deals exclusively with the gas industry are frac sand providers when a company engages in hydraulic fracturing an injection of high quality sand is required to keep the fissures in the rock open to allow gas and liquid through both schlumberger and halliburton sell frac sand as part of their offerings but there are numerous small independent frac sand providers as well utilities once processed natural gas makes its way through a midstream pipeline it s often picked up by a local utility which distributes it to customers these utilities are usually referred to by investors as utilities rather than gas companies although many customers might refer to duke energy or southern company as the gas company both also distribute electricity as do most gas utilities the vast majority of gas utilities are large regulated and slow growing so one of the most important factors in an investment decision is the size and reliability of the company s dividend delivery companies propane delivery companies are the odd ducks of the gas industry these companies store and distribute propane and propane cylinders to consumers for gas grills in the summer and heating in the winter because they don t fractionate the propane but just deliver it they are largely immune from fluctuations in gas prices they get paid for the deliveries a spate of warmer winters has taken its toll on the propane delivery industry which consists primarily of mlps including suburban propane partners nyse sph with weather on a warming trend this niche probably isn t going to be of much interest to gas investors a brief history of the u s gas industry natural gas has been used in the u s since 1816 when imported gas extracted from coal was used to power streetlights in baltimore the first u s gas well was drilled in 1821 and with the invention of the bunsen burner in 1885 gas became far more practical to use over the next century more wells and a pipeline network were built and according to 2017 census data piped natural gas is the primary home heating fuel in the country used in 48 of homes with another 4 7 using kerosene heat or other forms of gas the biggest recent advance in the natural gas industry is hydraulic fracturing or fracking which injects high pressure liquid into a well to crack the surrounding rock releasing trapped gas and liquid hydrocarbons sand is then injected into the hole to hold the cracks open and allow gas to continue to flow although fracking has been around since the 1940s it wasn t widely used in shale formations until the late 1990s now however the technique has been extensively used in shale formations across the u s turning them into major natural gas producers and fueling the u s s natural gas boom that boom has been extraordinary according to the u s energy information administration eia in 2005 the u s produced 18 9 trillion mcf of natural gas in 2018 it produced 32 8 trillion mcf the u s has been the top natural gas producer in the world since 2009 in fact we re now awash in so much gas that many companies are racing to construct lng export terminals to export that gas overseas the u s exported no lng by ship in 2013 and in 2014 was only sending about 13 3 billion cubic feet to japan by 2018 however the u s was exporting 1 1 trillion cubic feet of lng to 32 different countries where is natural gas produced and processed the eia hasn t done a survey of the largest gas fields in the u s since 2013 at the time the marcellus shale in the pennsylvania west virginia ohio appalachian region was the largest in terms of estimated production today the marcellus shale is often lumped together with the neighboring utica shale formation other major gas fields in 2013 that are still important today are the barnett and eagle ford shales of texas the woodford shale of oklahoma the haynesville shale in texas louisiana the antrim shale in michigan indiana ohio the niobrara dj basin of wyoming and the san juan basin of new mexico however in recent years the permian basin of west texas a longtime oil haven has become a major producer of shale gas some gas is also produced offshore in the gulf of mexico but only about 5 of total u s production offshore drilling is more focused on oil production however 51 of natural gas processing facilities are located on the gulf coast which is also a major hub for oil refining the remaining gas processing facilities tend to be located near major gas fields gas pipelines crisscross the country from coast to coast getting raw and processed gas where it needs to go what affects gas prices in 1938 the u s government passed the natural gas act regulating the industry however after widespread shortages and pricing issues in the 1970s and 1980s the government gradually began a process of deregulation which resulted in increased production and cheaper prices today gas prices fluctuate on the open market the primary factor affecting the price of natural gas is supply and demand despite the massive increase in natural gas supply over the last ten years prices have not fallen as much as you might expect the standard price quoted for natural gas is the henry hub spot price which is measured in dollars per british thermal units btus the henry hub is the world s largest gas distribution hub built on a major pipeline in erath louisiana the site was chosen because of its accessibility to many major gas markets it s the official delivery location for gas futures contracts on the new york mercantile exchange here s how the henry hub spot price has changed over the last ten years henry hub natural gas spot price data by ycharts natural gas spot prices fell in 2014 along with oil prices during the oil price downturn of 2014 2017 in fact because oil and gas are so often produced together oil and gas prices sometimes lumped together as energy prices often move in tandem henry hub natural gas spot price data by ycharts however the henry hub price isn t the only gas price in the u s different local hubs designated delivery sites that have pipeline and storage infrastructure to move and transfer gas quickly offer different prices that may exceed or lag the henry hub price again primarily determined by local supply and demand there are more than 100 local gas hubs in the u s and prices can vary quite widely among them for example in the permian basin in april 2019 pipeline bottlenecks combined with record production levels actually caused spot prices at the waha hub to turn negative meaning that sellers were actually paying buyers to take their gas away gas production companies can turn such price disparities to their advantage however by producing in a less expensive hub and shipping the gas to a more expensive hub for sale producers can improve their margins assuming that the price difference isn t eaten up in shipping costs it s a complex web of supply demand and pipeline capacity how to invest in gas stocks there are many ways to invest in gas stocks by far the most straightforward is to buy shares in a gas company or units in a gas mlp outright through a traditional or online broker most gas stocks are traded on the two big u s exchanges the nyse or the nasdaq even major foreign companies like royal dutch shell or the french company total some foreign gas stocks may not offer shares on u s exchanges these would need to be purchased over the counter many will offer american depository receipt shares adrs these are usually denoted by a five letter ticker symbol ending in y and mean that the company is offering its shares to u s investors and are executed in the u s an alternate type of share is an f share which usually has a five letter ticker symbol ending in f these shares are requested by u s brokers to allow their clients to trade directly in foreign companies and are executed on foreign exchanges sometimes there can be multiple adrs or f shares or a combination of both for a single company for example russian gas giant gazprom offers two adr tickers ogzry and ogzpy be sure you understand the risks before investing in a foreign company that isn t traded on a u s exchange if you prefer to invest in the sector as a whole as opposed to in individual stocks you might consider buying shares in an exchange traded fund or etf an etf is a fund that owns a number of stocks in a particular sector so buying shares in the fund gives you broad exposure to the sector many energy sector etfs combine oil and gas investments and most focus on upstream companies so for example the ishares u s oil gas exploration and production etf seeks to track the performance of upstream oil and gas companies as a whole while the first trust natural gas etf tries to mimic only the performance of upstream gas companies other etfs are even more specific the vaneck vectors unconventional oil gas etf only tracks unconventional oil and gas production such as coal bed methane shale gas or oil from oil sands meanwhile many indexes contain oil and gas stocks so buying shares of an etf or investing in an index fund will often provide some gas exposure for example a purchase of the vanguard 500 index fund would get you exposure to the gas companies in the s p 500 including oil major chevron driller apache corporation nyse apa and gas pipeline operator kinder morgan much more to learn about gas stocks now that you understand a bit more about gas stocks you should have no problem delving more deeply into individual companies financials news releases and reports to learn more about them but the sector has seen big changes in recent years and is likely to continue changing quickly still with so many companies involved there s a wealth of opportunity for investors in gas 10 stocks we like better than kinder morgan when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a

authored by andrew moran via libertynation com japan has not recovered fully from the lost decade of the 1990s the asian financial crisis was exacerbated by the dot com crash and then a few years later the global economic collapse tokyo has tried everything to combat anemic growth and deflation and resolve the zombification of the japanese economy through an immense buildup of government debt and a dramatic loosening of monetary policy including subzero interest rates this has become known as japanification in recent years europe has seen its own japanification and now it looks like the united states could mirror it too inflation expectations this past summer federal reserve chair jerome powell rejected unsound advice from some of the world s top economists when he dismissed a proposal to raise the inflation target rate from the current 2 percent to 4 percent proponents of this policy say it would allow the central bank to cut interest rates before they slide to zero which would create a whole new set of problems for the central bank and the overall economy powell conceded that it was not a practical alternative and wondered how credible that would be it looks like some fed minds found a compromise temporarily boosting the inflation target rate since it listed 2 percent as the key rate to hit in 2012 the fed has had a difficult time meeting that objective policymakers are getting fed up with the fed s inability to get inflation to reach their target despite the unemployment rate hitting a fifty year low as part of its annual review of monetary policy tools the fed is contemplating increasing its aim to grapple with its lackluster inflation the financial times reported citing current and former fed policymakers the newspaper suggests that the fed is thinking about temporarily raising its goal when it misses its inflation target this would allow the fed to make up for lost inflation and prevent prolonged low us price growth how are current and former fed officials reacting reactions ex fed chair janet yellen thinks it is a worthwhile thing to discuss positing that it would be similar to its forward guidance used in the early post recession days at the time the central bank informed markets that it planned to keep short term rates low for a significant period before finishing her tenure at the fed she admitted that she was open to the possibility of raising the 2 percent range we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us former fed vice chair stanley fischer conceded that he opposes a 4 percent target rate because unions would want to tie their wages to inflation lael brainard a member of the fed board of governors stated that she prefers something a bit more flexible recommending that the range increase from 2 to 2 5 percent after several misses as long as you are communicating to the public financial markets households and businesses about what you are doing the rules could work effectively she noted but brainard also believes that the subject is presently too complex to share with the public fed bank of boston president eric rosengren says that it is important to let markets know that you cannot have readings only below 2 percent to meet the target inflation rate he also believes that this formulaic approach would concern financial markets this is why i prefer something that is a little bit more flexible maybe not as constraining but makes it a little clearer that we should be having over 2 percent rosengren told the times are negative rates next everything about the way governments and central banks report inflation is egregious they usually underreport so price inflation is likely higher than what is being touted for the sake of analyzing what the fed is doing let us suppose that the inflation rate is what the establishment says it is a key argument against raising the inflation target rate is that the fed funds rate is already at historic lows in the next recession monetary policy would largely be ineffective unless it torches long term sustainability by introducing subzero interest rates to spur growth this would be the death knell of the world s largest economy since negative rates signify that the fed has exhausted all tools at its disposal others make the argument that inflation expectations would be lower under this scheme could the united states experience its own japanification despite a myriad of monetary stimulus measures to reverse these trends nearly everything employed has failed it appears that negative rates will not stave off japan s upcoming recession instead these efforts have sent bond yields lower created bad bank loans and increased debt levels an empty tank is the tank empty as with the european central bank ecb and the bank of japan boj everything the fed does will largely be ineffective during the next recession during the boom phase of the business cycle the central bank has cut rates expanded the money supply and relaunched quantitative easing qe by scooping up billions in treasuries and injecting credit markets with cash what else can the fed do negative rates seem the next logical step what is clear is that the fed is making up strategies as it goes along sacrificing long term gains for immediate survival and instant gratification

energy sector is a challenging one for investors especially when it comes to oil and natural gas companies energy prices can change in a heartbeat volatility can have a massive impact on the sector as well as on the global economy we ve seen examples of the volatile market in recent years oil and natural gas prices plunged during the early days of the covid 19 pandemic as demand dried up they rebounded sharply in 2021 as consumption recovered energy prices continued their ascent in 2022 hitting new highs after russia invaded ukraine however they began to cool off in late 2022 and into 2023 on concerns that the global economy was slowing down because of the impact commodity price volatility can have on the energy sector investors need to understand how to invest in energy stocks that includes keeping risks in mind and not allocating too much of a portfolio to one energy stock or the entire industry investors should focus on oil and natural gas companies with the financial and operational strength to survive if industry conditions significantly deteriorate factors that increase an energy company s durability include a low risk business model for oil and natural gas producers this means having diversified operations and low production costs meanwhile energy infrastructure companies should have stable revenue with minimal exposure to fluctuations in volumes or pricing such as operations supported by regulated rates or long term fixed fee contracts for oil and natural gas producers this means having diversified operations and low production costs meanwhile

billionaires vs the middle class across america who pays more in taxes although the u s tax system has been flawed for quite some time trump s tax cuts and jobs act signed in december 2017 churned the fiscal waters and brought plenty of opinions and proposed actions to surface some of those opinions and proposed actions bubbled up in october 2019 with the release of economists emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman s book the triumph of injustice how the rich dodge taxes and how to make them pay although saez and zucman make a case that wealth inequality is a growing problem in america the burning question is do u s billionaires really pay less in taxes than the middle class last updated dec 13 2019 the tax history of the top 1 isn t much different than how things are now when people begin arguing about how much the wealthiest americans have paid in taxes in the past versus how much they re paying now it s helpful to have some context according to the tax foundation the top one percent of americans today do not face an unusually low tax burden by historical standards top marginal rates for taxes have fallen drastically since the 1950s or have they in the 1950s the top marginal tax rate was 91 today it s 37 which seems like a drastic drop but according to the tax foundation the top 1 of taxpayers in the 1950s only ended up giving up about 42 of their income in federal state and local government taxes this means that the current marginal tax rate of 37 isn t that much lower than the effective tax rate high earners faced in the 1950s the 91 tax rate was the exception not the rule the reason for the 42 tax rate was that the 91 federal income tax rate only applied to households that had income exceeding 200 000 which were in the minority and that high tax rate only became effective when a household s income exceeded 200 000 and even then the higher rate only applied to the dollars above the 200 000 threshold not every dollar earned average income tax rates for the top 0 1 have remained relatively stable average income tax rates have remained relatively stable for the wealthiest americans in the 1950s the top 0 1 of households faced average effective income tax rates of 21 versus 20 7 as of 2014 according to data from the tax foundation higher marginal tax rates don t always translate into higher revenue collection you might wonder how a top marginal income tax rate of 91 could translate into an average income tax rate of just 21 for the top 0 1 in the 1950s advertisement advertisement as stated earlier the 91 tax rate only applied to amounts earned over 200 000 in addition tax avoidance behaviors and lower reported income were also likely factors as marginal tax rates rise it s not unusual for taxpayers to tend to under report income does the us tax system look like a giant flat tax in a november 2019 phone interview with capital main zucman described how he perceives the u s tax system as a giant flat tax where each segment of the population except for the wealthiest americans commits around 25 to 30 of its income in taxes the wealthiest americans pay a lesser rate of 23 which means that the tax system becomes regressive at the top check out 30 tax shelters tax breaks and other tax tips you should take from the rich economists claim the tax system has been turned on its head not surprisingly the culprit that upset the tax system according to saez and zucman is trump s tax cuts and jobs act that was signed into law in december 2017 although the president repeatedly stated that the tcja would benefit the middle class and it has to a point many experts point out that the wealthiest americans are the ones who have benefited the most from the tax cuts how the trump tax cuts and jobs act has benefited the wealthy according to authors and economists saez and zucman the tax cuts and jobs act have benefited the ultra rich according to their research they concluded that in 2018 the top 0 1 the billionaires of america paid an average effective tax rate of 23 which factors in all federal state and local taxes the bottom 50 of u s households however paid a higher rate of 24 2 toward income tax the top 0 1 pay a lower rate than other household groups too according to saez and zucman it s not only the bottom 50 of households who pay more which include many in the middle class it s also those in the upper middle class and in the top 1 who pay more in taxes than those in the 0 1 do warren buffett explains one reason why the rich pay lower tax rates than the middle class billionaire investor warren buffett is known for saying that he pays less tax as a percentage than his secretary does while that may seem impossible it s not buffett and other billionaires are mainly taxed on capital gains income as investors not salary or income earned as an employee and capital gains income is taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income is the tax cuts and jobs act even more specifically benefits the super rich zucman and saez claim in their book that capital income is becoming tax free due to provisions like these that were implemented as part of the tcja advertisement advertisement corporations enjoy a lower tax rate which was reduced from 37 to 21 a 20 deduction applies to business income for many taxpayers saez and zucman s conclusions may not be as reliable as some think as with any economic theories based on data opponents have been able to poke holes in the theories presented by saez and zucman here are some points to consider story continues subsidy programs are left out of saez and zucman s calculations saez and zucman did not include refundable tax credits and benefit programs that aid in offsetting the cost of excise payroll and sales taxes the omission of these particular credits and benefits is significant for example the refundable portions of the child tax credit and earned income tax credit can keep many low income workers mainly those who have children from owing federal payroll tax on their earnings the result of failing to include these credits and benefits in the calculations can make it appear that the lowest income earners are paying more in taxes than they actually are unreported untaxed income is overestimated estimated average tax rates are determined by dividing the taxes paid by the income but the assumption is that not all income is reported to the irs for the purposes of their study saez and zucman assumed that all households under reported income in proportion to their reported income even when irs taxpayer audit data shows that s not true unfortunately misallocating under reported income inflates the income of the highest earners which in turn drives down the estimated tax rate the result it can look like the highest earners are paying less in taxes than they really are where do we go from here one thing is for sure the issues surrounding whether the wealthiest in the u s are paying less taxes than the middle class won t rest from economists to presidential hopefuls to tax policy organizations everyone has a point or two or three to make here s a preview of what you can look forward to in the future regarding these issues advertisement advertisement find out how much the rich would actually pay if they had higher tax rates the institute on taxation and economic policy gives a peek at tcja in 2020 the institute on taxation and economic policy has estimated the effects of trump s tcja in 2020 according to itep the majority of the law s benefits will go to the wealthiest 20 of americans and a considerable portion will go to foreign investors who own stocks in u s companies and will benefit from the corporate tax cuts that are part of the tcja itep estimated data shows tcja favors wealthiest americans here is a breakdown of itep s estimates advertisement advertisement itep estimates that in 2020 half of the law s benefits that go to american taxpayers 145 billion will be received by the richest 5 of those taxpayers itep also estimates that in 2020 72 of the law s benefits that go to american taxpayers or 205 billion will be received by the richest 20 of those taxpayers finally itep estimates that in 2020 foreign investors will receive 38 billion as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act corporate tax cuts democratic presidential hopefuls have views aligned with saez and zucman it s no secret that some of the democratic presidential hopefuls are proponents of increased taxation for the wealthiest americans they ve even been taking advice from zucman here s a look at what sens elizabeth warren and bernie sanders think about taxes warren and sanders tax advisor says 75 is the ideal tax rate for the richest 1 zucman who is advising warren and sanders on their wealth tax proposals states in his co authored book that the perfect federal marginal income tax rate would be 60 but the perfect effective tax rate for combined taxes for the wealthiest americans including local state federal and payroll taxes would be 75 which is more than two times the current rate paid by the 1 warren and sanders both favor a wealth tax but warren and sanders as well as saez and zucman agree that while increasing income taxes is needed that alone won t fix the growing inequality of wealth advertisement advertisement a progressive wealth taxation study by saez and zucman published in the brookings papers on economic activity found that the accumulation of wealth among the top earners would be considerably less if a moderate wealth tax had been implemented in 1982 for example instead of being worth 160 billion in 2018 jeff bezos founder of amazon would be worth only 86 8 billion or less than half of his current net worth both warren and sanders support a wealth tax to address income inequality warren s wealth tax is considered the more moderate of the two whereas sanders example of wealth tax is considered extreme here s a look at each plan elizabeth warren s ultra millionaire tax applies to the top 0 1 here are the facts of warren s wealth tax proposal advertisement advertisement only applies to households with a net worth of 50 million or more roughly 75 000 u s households or top 0 1 would be subject to wealth tax annual 2 tax on every dollar of net worth exceeding 50 million annual 6 tax on every dollar of net worth exceeding 1 billion over 10 years the wealth tax will yield 3 75 trillion in revenue bernie sanders wealth tax is considered extreme in comparison to warren s here s a quick rundown of what sanders plan entails annual tax that applies to top 0 1 of u s households applies to net worths exceeding 32 million those with net worths less than 32 million would not be affected over 15 years will raise around 4 35 trillion and cut the wealth of billionaires in half potential problems exist with a wealth tax even if a wealth tax sounds like a perfect solution to the growing income inequality between the 0 1 and the rest of americans that doesn t mean there wouldn t be issues for example tax avoidance and evasion would still occur plus thriving entrepreneurs and business owners would be the hardest hit which could negatively impact their ability to save invest and hire new employees final answer do billionaires pay a lower tax rate than the middle class it depends on who you ask if you were to ask saez and zucman this question the answer would be a resounding yes if you were to ask opponents of saez and zucman s theories the answer would likely be no advertisement advertisement perhaps forbes senior contributor howard gleckman stated it best arguments about methodology shouldn t mask saez s and zucman s bigger point incomes of the very rich are rising faster than for all other income groups and the tcja cut the taxes of high earners by more on average than for low and moderate income households as a share of after tax income but that doesn t mean that billionaires paid a lower tax rate than the working class more from gobankingrates this article originally appeared on gobankingrates com billionaires vs the middle class across america who pays more in taxes

zimbabwe s minister of finance has declared the austerity measures officially over addressing the delegates to the zanu pf 18th national conference in goromonzi mthuli states that the government could afford to turn the page on austerity as he taburlated the success of the two years old austerity measures the minister claimed that a rise in spending this year and next would bring about a new life of renewal critics warned that his claims were overblown and that two years of spending cuts would continue to take their toll would it be correct that a line is being drawn under austerity the minister indicated that by 2023 zimbabwe will be operating under a budget of billions of united states dollars the minister has cast light into sources of the countries fortunes boasting of prospective income of over thirty billion dollars a year the minister rightly said the increase represented the largest increase in at least 30 years and was a turning point after two years of spending cuts he also topped up next year s capital spending by over six billion above the current and this would be in us dollars the annual public spending deficit the difference between government income and expenditure reached almost 200 in the wake of the financial crisis most of the traditional sources of advice the international monetary fund the oecd the governor of the reserve bank said government spending cuts were needed to balance the books under the old dispensation the treasury forced through measures that increased local authority spending by about 60 and imposed 40 over spending on many government departments public investment also came to a virtual standstill bringing to an end years of improvements to hospital and school buildings and any infrastructure the austerity measures then saw budgets not saved from mthuli s knife the nation experienced hardships which were never seen since records began mthuli s plan was supposed to spur growth and reduce the government deficit the gap between income and expenditure to zero by 2022 cuts to the schools budget were introduced two years ago leading to widespread staff lay offs and rising deficits especially in secondary schools to show the effect of diminished government funds being spread across more people with domestic debts being wiped out the economic crisis hurt businesses and the financial sector while the government used all of taxpayer funds to bail out some government projects much of which has subsequently been recouped the dramatic cuts in public spending meant ministers had reduced means to support households the bedrock of spending in the economy and the wider business community at the time he proposed maintaining public investment arguing that with borrowing rates at historic lows in the post crash period there was an opportunity to improve the infrastructure on the cheap with government unprepared to step in businesses remained nervous about the future and private investment failed to take off un employment jumped to a record high but without an increase in public or private investment productivity stagnated and wages rose more slowly than inflation leaving household incomes depressed the ispending plans were enough to reverse about two thirds of the real terms cuts to average day to day spending on public services since 2010 however this achievement is even less significant when the rising population is taken into account on a per capita basis only one third of the cuts are reversed the average rise also masks substantial variation within the total these are commitments that are likely to limit the scope for further increases in departmental or welfare spending

positive momentum this week we published homebuilders rejuvenation set to continue into 2020 for the 10 homebuilders in our coverage third quarter earnings were impressive to say the least while revenue growth rose just 3 from last year the most closely watched forward looking metric net order growth significantly exceeded expectations rising more than 15 from last year confirming that lower mortgage rates and resilient demographic driven demand are indeed translating into improved order growth and at a rate stronger than even many of the most bullish analysts predicted commentary on earnings calls was decidedly positive with most builders noting momentum continuing in the weeks since quarter end homebuilders remain an unloved sector still trading at deep discounts to historical and market multiples despite double digit earnings growth homebuilders have increasingly shifted into entry level segments where projected demand growth is strongest luxury homebuilder toll brothers tol reported earnings that beat estimates on the top and bottom line including an 18 jump in order growth but remains the far and away weakest performing builder in the sector this year homebuilders focusing on the entry level product have generally outperformed this year led by kb home kbh meritage mth d r horton dhi nvr nvr pultegroup phm and lennar len all of which are up more than 50 this year for homebuilders it s all about the 5 ls lending lumber labor land and legislation and in 2018 all five of these factors were stiff headwinds most notably for lending higher mortgage rates pushed affordability to cycle lows while lumber labor and land costs were all significantly higher throughout the year legislation through tax reform and the continued challenges on the zoning and permitting front may have been the most significant headwind of all given the reduction in homeownership incentives associated with doubling the standard deduction and the state and local tax deduction cap helping to power this year s recovery at least two of these headwinds lending and lumber have become significant tailwinds in 2019 with mortgage rates flirting with historic lows and lumber and other construction materials prices pulling back significantly after hitting record highs in 2018 real estate economic data inflation remains cool despite tariffs cpi and ppi data this week continued to reflect muted inflationary pressure producer price inflation was cooler than expected in november as core ppi was flat on a month over month basis and was higher by just 1 3 year over year the smallest gain since september 2016 also this week the bls released core cpi data which was in line with estimates with the year over year rate remaining steady at 2 3 while some analysts had expected a tariff related uptick in inflation the effects of chinese currency depreciation and a more general moderating in global economic activity have overwhelmed any upward pressure on us consumer prices so far in 2019 housing costs continue to be the primary driver of what little overall inflation that there is housing cpi shelter accounts for more than a third of the total cpi weight 42 including housing related services and since 2013 housing inflation has been significantly above the overall inflation rate from 2015 through late 2016 housing inflation was one of the only components keeping core cpi out of deflationary territory and since 2013 core inflation excluding housing has averaged roughly than 1 consistent with earnings results from the apartment reits and private market data showing solid rent growth since late 2018 cpi shelter remains well above the broader rate of inflation at 3 3 primary rents rose 3 7 on a year over year basis while owner equivalent rents rose 3 3 cpi shelter has now been above 3 for more than 50 consecutive months retail sales missed estimates in november total retail sales in the us increased less than expected in november though the monthly data may have been impacted by the relatively late thanksgiving holiday other reports from private data providers have painted a brighter picture however with adobe analytics reporting double digit gains

rate of growth last month five of the ten brick and mortar categories recorded a sequential decline in sales with department stores clothing and health personal care retailers seeing the most pronounced declines over the last month sales at department stores and clothing retailers are now lower by 7 2 and 3 3 respectively from the same month last year standouts to the upside in november were the electronics and appliance retailers and the food and beverage category as discussed this week in our report on the mall reit sector softline clothing and accessories and specialty retailers have weakened considerably in 2019 after seeing relatively robust growth last year during the so called retail apocalypse of 2016 2017 these categories were particularly weak after recovering nicely throughout 2018 these softline and specialty retailers have again fallen on tougher times this year as the rate of store closures particularly in the clothing and softline categories has again reaccelerated lower productivity mall reits including cbl associates cbl have been hit especially hard by this year s slowdown as the company was forced to suspend its dividend on both common and preferred stocks last week while nearly 90 of total retail sales are still completed through the traditional brick and mortar channels e commerce sales account for roughly a fifth of at risk retail categories which exclude food auto and gasoline sales and brick and mortar retailers have been losing share at a rate of roughly 1 per year the market share loss has been even more significant for the

the main aim of this research is to analyze and present why and how china is trying to implement a plan with which it could become an independent financial pole what kind of sources has beijing gathered for financing bri why and how should armenia try to be involved in the financial sector of the bri what will armenia and china get if they cooperate in the aforementioned sphere why should china be interested in conversion of chinese renminbi to armenian currency and why should it be interested in establishing a branch of any chinese bank in armenia china is trying to influence the world economy through bri with which it is creating a financial and economic platform that can act independently from the west so that in the event of a china us confrontation china would not be isolated in turn countries which will create ties with china through bri will get chinese loans and investments in order to implement the aforementioned strategy thanks to the work of the chinese diplomatic corps on october 1 2016 chinese currency was included in the special drawing rights sdr valuation basket by the international monitory fund from my point of view one of the main aims of this step to strengthen the position of chinese renminbi which will provide an opportunity to beijing to give loans and implement vast investment projects in states which are involved in the bri using its own national currency and in international trade grow the quantity of financial transfers with renminbi beijing also aims to reduce its dependence from the usd as chinese authors mention bri will provide an opportunity to china to strengthen renminbi role as a regional currency and afterwards as an international currency china s investments in the framework of bri rise the global meaning of chinese initiative as due to asian development bank s report infrastructure needs in developing asia and the pacific will exceed from 1 5 to 1 7 trillion per year in october 2015 china established china international payment service cips which aims to make chinese currency available at foreign banking systems and it will reduce also china s dependence from the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication swift dozens of international banks have already joined and can use chinese cips it is worth noting also the importance of yinilan 银联 union pay payment service it provides states which are participating in bri with an opportunity to make interbank and international bank transfers using chinese currency it is worth mentioning that already in the end of 2016 chinese banks opened 62 branches in 26 states which participated in bri china officially mentioned in its vision and actions on jointly building silk road economic belt and 21st century maritime silk road document that china must rise exchange of currencies with the bri participants create and develop asian bond markets for implementing aforementioned aims china creates financial system in which joint financial structures foundations established by beijing and partners several chinese banks are playing leading and crucial roles it is expected that china s government will invest 1 trillion in total in its bri the research of bri s financial system is important as it provides an opportunity to states which have stable financial systems to be involved in bri s financial economic system and get benefits silk road foundation until 2018 the main financial investments in bri have been made by chinese companies it is clear that both interests and resources of chinese companies are limited thus for continuation of chinese investments in the framework of bri and for financing projects of the foreign countries as well on december 29 2014 beijing established silk road foundation the main aim of this foundation is to make investments and develop infrastructure industry and financial systems it has 40 billion capital it is also worth mentioning that until may 2017 it has provided 4 billion for investments within the framework of bri asian infrastructure investment bank special importance was also ascribed to the establishment of the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib in january 2016 it is worth mentioning that china was able to establish the aiib under pressure from the us aiib authorized capital amounts to 100 billion according to xi jinping s report aiib until 2017has provided 1 7bn for investments within the framework of bri from the south caucasus georgia and azerbaijan are members of aiib representatives of these countries are also included in the board of governors in 2016 november azerbaijan succeeded to receive 600 million from aiib to build a trans anatolian gas pipeline and georgia received 114 million from the bank to build a bypass road on one hand armenia is a member of the eaeu and on the other hand it is strengthening its cooperation with the eu yerevan also speaks about its commitment to strengthen cooperation with china in the field of transportation in the framework of china s bri initiative it is worth mentioning that to become a transit country in transportation corridors which unite different regions of the eurasian continent armenia must at first develop and modernize its poorly developed transportation infrastructure for this reason armenia is building the 556 kilometer north south road corridor which will start at the armenian iranian border and stretch to the armenian georgian border in 2018 china s lead asian infrastructure investment bank which is investing mainly in transportation infrastructures in bri participant countries published its transport sector strategy sustainable and integrated transport for trade and economic growth in asia the research of this strategy shows that its main aims fully coincide with armenian north south road corridor investment program which is being implemented by transport project implementation organization my recommendation is that at first armenia can try to stand regional member of the asian infrastructure investment bank and after get sovereign backed or non sovereign backed loans for its state owned noncommercial organizations private organizations and international organizations which works in the territory of armenia that they invest this money in armenian north south transportation corridor which will significantly enhance armenia s capabilities to be involved in the silk road economic belt s china central asia west asia economic belt i think that armenia s accession to aiib will also allow to start negotiations for a possibility of getting a loan for the construction of the armenian iranian railroad brics new development bank the other crucial step in this direction was the foundation of brics new development bank with the other members of brics this international financial institution has its own monetary fund and its main aim is to ensure the financial sustainability of its founders within the period of 2016 2017 the bank has approved a 3 4 billion credit line the ndb aims to provide this amount for the development of communications renewable energy water purification irrigation and other projects it was confirmed that the initial capital of the ndb would be 50 billion which would be shared by the member states on a parity basis it was also decided that the statutory capital of the bank should be raised to 100 billion the ndb center is located in shanghai china with the ultimate goal of providing financial sustainability for its founders in other words the ndb will be financing most of the initiatives undertaken within the framework of bri in china russia india brazil and south african republic chinese banks financing bri china development bank 国家开发银行 near the end of 2014th year the latest capital of the cdb reached the amount of 10 32 trillion chinese renminbi in 2014 the cdb has provided 1 56 trillion yuan for investments in foreign countries the cdb declares that it serves china s bri and promotes the chinese companies go global policy one of the cdb s objectives is to deepen cooperation with foreign governments in financial institutions industrial centers infrastructures finance agriculture and energy for example the cdb has opened a 10 billion credit line for the asean member states to develop their infrastructures this line of credit can also be used by chinese companies which are going to build factories and develop industries in these countries the export import bank of china 中国进出口银行 the export import bank of china is a state funded and state owned policy bank with the status of an independent legal entity one of the main goals of this bank is to promote china s foreign trade and the normal course of investments the development of economic cooperation with the outside world and the support of chinese organizations in the framework of the go global policy for example in 2013 this bank provided 385 million loan to kyrgyzstan to modernize bishkek thermal power plant china bank 中国银行 in 2014 the cb actives reached 2 458 trillion the bank has announced that the 2016 2018 china will provide 100 billion to chinese companies to finance projects abroad within the framework of bri industrial and commercial bank of china 中国工商银行 icbc the icbc is the largest bank in the world by the year of 2016 it has created 412 financial institutions in the world 127 of which are located in the bri countries the icbc declares that it will support the policy of chinese organizations abroad in sum china uses governmental international and private financial resources for the successful implementation of bri it is worth mentioning that china combined the internationalization of the renminbi with the globalization of the bri initiative for one thing the implementation of bri provides an added impetus and unique platform for continuation of the establishment of the renminbi as an international currency and for another it fostersthe sustainable development of the financial sector of bri outside of china which provides an opportunity for china to turn into an independent financial pole prospects for sino armenian cooperation in the financial banking sphere within the framework of the bri taking into account international experience based on which the cdb has agreed to provide egypt s sibbank funding for financing egyptian enterprises and financial support to singaporean and chinese companies should be provided to invest in the framework of bri i do believe that it is possible to get a credit line from the chinese banks for armenian small and medium sized businesses which are importing to armenia chinese high technologies as a result armenia s businessmen will be able to expand their business with additional cash flows to armenia and china in its turn will be able to put its own money into circulation and increase interest in chinese made equipment and products in armenia which is a member of eurasian economic union armenian business companies can also start direct negotiations with chinese companies for starting joint investments in armenia after the agreements between both sides entities in special projects chinese business companies can apply to the above mentioned chinese banks that they provide them finances for investing in armenian within the framework of bri one of the best arguments for this hypothesis is the message of xi jinping to chinese organizations according to which the chinese leadership is interested in the fact that chinese companies are increasing their role in investing within the framework of the bri basing on the go global policy assessment of the establishment of a chinese bank in ra from the viewpoint of economic persistence of ra internationalization of chinese renminbi provides a wide range of opportunities to countries with stable banking systems included in the bri as they have the opportunity to engage chinese banks in their own banking system or to establish intermediary banks operating in chinese currency to provide a conversion of their currency by renminbi the following question arises why should china be interested in conversion of chinese renminbi to armenian currency and why should it be interested in establishing a branch of any chinese banks in armenia china will get an opportunity to trade with armenia with chinese currency due to ministry of foreign affairs of armenia bilateral direct trade between armenia and china is worth 490 million usd with this step the role of the renminbi will be strengthened in the global financial arena additionally if the chinese side establishes a bank in armenia chinese capital will be involved in the armenian financial banking sphere the following question arises as well what will armenia get if a branch of one of the leading chinese banks is opened or if armenia and china establish a joint bank the result will be significant financial investments in armenia the financial field of the country will be diversified and if dram renminbi conversion is introduced bilateral trade between armenia and china will be realized in their own currencies thanks to which armenian and chinese businessman will no longer lose money in currency exchange according to our calculations the armenian side loses about 10mln annually due to the above mentioned function which can be ruled out if the armenian banks are able to transfer their chinese counterparts directly renminbi chinese and armenians living and studying in china and in armenian will also benefit and be able to transfer chinese currency to armenia and to get money in the opposite direction without any additional losses of time and money china and russia announced that they will try to deepen cooperation and reduce their tensions through the harmonization of the eaeu and bri membership in the eaeu provides an opportunity to armenia to defend its interests during negotiations with big china more productively as armenia can first include the projects in the agenda of the eaeu in which it is interested and after that in from the name of the eaeu team already from a strengthened position introduce its projects to the chinese side and the other recommendation is that that from time to time armenia must invite chinese businessmen and specialists to armenia and offer them projects which can bring bilateral benefit dr mher d sahakyan the author of the book belt and road initiative and armenia 2018 from which this essay is adapted translated from armenian used by permission all rights reserved
washington impeached or not president donald trump has a strong tailwind heading into his re election year the economy presidential contests tend to turn on it s the economy stupid as democratic strategist james carville famously summed up underdog bill clinton s win in 1992 and things look good for trump at this time unemployment is at a 50 year low stocks are at all time highs and forecasters project growth into 2020 especially as the trade war with china seems to be easing if the status quo continues he ll win said moody s analytics chief economist mark zandi referring to his presidential prediction model which is based on economic indicators including gas prices and the unemployment rate along with the president s approval rating and projected turnout zandi s is just one of several prediction models that favor trump who also has the benefit of incumbency the president never misses an opportunity to boast about the dow or the latest jobs report and those rosy indicators give other republicans something to run on no matter what s happening in washington for folks running for congress or senate it s something they can and will tout every single day said republican strategist matt gorman so should democrats worry yes said carville everything worries me with democrats in the midst of a presidential primary fight there s widespread agreement among the candidates and their biggest allies that many americans aren t feeling the benefits of a robust economy and that trump can be defeated by highlighting those inequities while liberal megacities are booming rust belt swing states such as pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin have lost thousands of manufacturing jobs this year after an earlier revival due in part to trade disputes and unemployment rates have begun to tick up a bit in dozens of battleground counties in the industrial midwest in wisconsin s marinette county which trump won by 34 points the unemployment rate has climbed a full percentage point in the past year though it s still low historically stocks are up but so are costs democrats say rising health and child care costs ballooning student debt and concerns about retirement savings have left many voters feeling anxious about the future even while others are enjoying the growth of their 401 k accounts half of americans 49 percent worry about an immediate financial need such as paying rent or bills while another quarter of the population have no immediate needs but are concerned about long term financial issues like retirement paying for a child s education and health care costs according to surveys taken by gallup virtually every cost in the life of a middle class family is up and that dynamic is frankly one of the reasons why trump won the last election said sen bob casey a democrat who represents the key battleground state of pennsylvania there was a frustration that neither party was addressing that basic problem those issues predated trump but democrats argue he not only failed to address them but also made things worse by undermining the affordable care act and squandering his biggest legislative opportunity on a tax cut that most americans think helped the wealthy and not them related donald trump in hershey pennsylvania those messages have already started to appear in ads run by democratic super pacs like priorities usa which has spent 8 2 million since july on digital ads in swing states presidential candidates also have highlighted rising costs and sluggish wage growth in speeches and ads the idea that trump s strength is on the economy is false said patrick mchugh priorities usa executive director while macro indicators might suggest that the economy is doing alright everyday americans are not feeling that the super pac s extensive polling of battleground states has found voters satisfaction with their economic situation fell 8 percentage points from may to october and their approval of trump s handling of the economy dropped from a net 10 points to an equal number approving and disapproving some nonpartisan polling backs that up a new pew survey found that while 69 percent of americans think the economy is helping the wealthy just 32 percent say it s helping the middle class and only 27 percent say it s helping the poor and 58 percent say the economy is actually hurting the middle class and 64 percent say it s hurting the poor overall though a slight majority of americans 52 percent approve of trump s handling of the economy according to the last nbc news wall street journal poll which is stronger than his overall approval rating of course a lot could change in the next year resisting trump s temperament selling their economic case will depend on democrats not repeating their mistakes of 2016 when they focused on trump s temperament while he focused on telling workers he would bring their jobs back we took a big mirror and projected trump s face on it and said to voters look at how grotesque it is look at how despicable it is and we never really turned the mirrors around to focus on what s actually going on in peoples communities said bradley beychok the president of the democratic super pac american bridge the group plans to spend at least 50 million in 2020 trying to soften up trump s support in conservative areas after having compiled research on 77 counties to try to localize messages about how the president driven things in the wrong direction on jobs health care costs and more lee saunders the president of afscme a union that represents 1 4 million mainly public sector workers said democrats have gotten better at talking about bread and butter issues but can t let impeachment take all the oxygen out of the room if you look at the democrats who are running for president right now these folks have started talking about how working families are being left behind he said they want to hear how you re going to help them and benefit them on a day to day level democrats were cautious with their criticism of the economy when barack obama was still in the white house but the 2020 presidential candidates have been relatively unified in dissecting the trump economy look beyond the daily headlines about the stock market and the unemployment rate you ll see a grim long term picture of our economy sen elizabeth warren said in an economic speech she delivered in new hampshire on thursday trump said he s going to take care of the forgotten man he got elected and forgot them former vice president joe biden said in an interview with cnbc last week trump is saying the economy is doing great just look at the stock market and a lot of folks around the country and around here in south bend say what about me mayor pete buttigieg told nbc news harry smith the democratic national committee and state parties plan to highlight what they call trump s broken promises to help forgotten workers for instance in 2017 he traveled to youngstown ohio to assure voters he would revive the struggling manufacturing sector and keep open a nearby g m plant the automaker was threatening to close those jobs have left ohio they re all coming back they re all coming back trump told a cheering crowd don t move don t sell your house g m shuttered the plant this year a recent quinnipiac survey found nearly six in 10 americans said they are better off financially now than they were in 2016 while a majority of wisconsin voters 53 percent say they approve of the way trump is handling the economy according to a new poll from marquette law school widely considered the best pollster in the state in fact americans are so deeply polarized that even their view of the economy not what they think should be done about it but just their appraisal of how well it s working today is tied to their partisan identity republicans view of the economy dramatically improved as soon as trump took office while democrats view of it declined even though the economy under the final months of president barack obama s tenure and first few months of trump looked virtually identical today 75 percent of republicans say the economy is excellent or good versus just 41 percent of democrats who say the same according to pew findings like that make carville wonder if in 2020 it really still is the economy stupid trump is impervious to everything good or bad he just stays at 41 7 carville said referring to the president s approval rating in fivethirtyeight com s average i don t care how many good stories about the economy come i don t care about how many bad stories come it still comes up 41 7

gold is threatening to bottom oil is marching on metals meh advertisement miners to the moon still em stocks flamed out junk was firm advertisement bonds were bid bigly stocks hardly budged try to make sense of this at the ft advertisement the agreement which was confirmed by officials in both washington and beijing on friday commits china to buying at least 40bn of us agricultural goods annually tightens protection for us intellectual property and bans the forced transfer of technology from us companies it also contains commitments on the chinese side against competitive devaluations of its currency and measures to improve access to its market for us financial services groups however china did not make concessions on some of the biggest sources of strain in the bilateral relationship such as its use of industrial subsidies and state owned enterprises as well as cybertheft leaving those thorny issues to a later stage in exchange for those concessions the us agreed not to proceed with a new escalation in levies on 156bn of chinese consumer goods planned for sunday and it will cut tariffs on 120bn of chinese imports that were introduced in september to 7 5 per cent from 15 per cent washington is still maintaining 25 per cent tariffs on about half of all chinese imports worth about 250bn which were introduced since the trade war began between the world s two largest economies in march 2018 the agreement still needs to be legally vetted and translated it is expected to be signed in early january and take effect a month later versus wsj chinese negotiators struck a more cautious tone at a hastily arranged press conference vice commerce minister wang shouwen one of china s lead negotiators said the u s had agreed to remove the remaining tariffs on chinese products in stages mr lighthizer said there was no such agreement on that and suggested china believes further reductions could be negotiated in later phases of the deal the chinese negotiators led by mr liu president xi jinping s point man on u s trade balked at guaranteeing the purchases for fear that such managed trade could violate the rules of the world trade organization and cause friction between china andits other trading partners china has yet to confirm this pledge or provide any details on how they will meet it said brian kuehl co executive director of farmers for free trade which backs removing tariffs and opening markets there are rightfully many doubts about the president s claim that china will purchase 50 billion in ag products in a single year more than twice the level of pre trade war annual purchases at friday s briefing ning jizhe a top deputy of the national development and reform commission hewed to the position beijing has maintained throughout the negotiations expanding trade cooperation must be based on market principles and wto rules that emphasis raised questions about whether china committed to any big purchases of u s products at all advertisement larry kudlow alos appeared at cnbc and declared that the ag purchese were over two years not even the administration appears to know what has been agreed lingering doubts are normal but these are gaping holes and there is no way to close them because the agreement itself is being kept secret it all reads like el trumpo sat down in front the mirror and agreed with himself how he would capitulate then signed that agreement with himself and everyone else is just an observor in the charade there s no definition no benchmarks and no enforcement as such el trumpo has now negotiated himself into such a corner that beijing can decide at its leisure whether it wants him re elected buy ag big or a democrat buy none at all advertisement if this it the linchpin in a 2020 global recovery then good luck global growth has been slowing on multiple fronts in 2019 trade volumes have fallen materially business investment has slumped amid geopolitcal tensions a global car sales shock has transpired led by china a universal oil and commodities glut has prevented new projects a post tax cut us economy has slowed china is dis leveraging and being rocked by a vehement hong kong rebellion europe has been held back by brexit uncertainty and its externally led economy the trade deal and uk brexit vote lifts a little of the geopolitcal fog but not enough to really matter advertisement the key problem is that the us china trade deal does nothing to dispel cold war 2 0 fears the deal is thin confused and opaque the us and china remain very much at each other s throats on trade and technology and most pointedly in hong kong chinese supply chains will remain under pressure so long as hong kong freedoms are in jeopardy and the threat of more tarrifs remains any risk assessment for new investment will either repatriate capital or send it into alternative emerging markets to china which will contonue to de globalise this means minimal respite for china s external sector in 2020 a us economy that will continue to lead global growth at a moderate pace and only a modest rebound for europe as brexit negotiations resume advertisement that is not to say that the market can t run for a while on hopes for better with phase two trade non deal negotiations beginning soon there s now a platform for the jawboning of equities through to the us election which is what this is really all about in sum i can t see anything beyond a modest global bounce out of this and therefore continued us economic outperformance that means a usd that refuses to fall and reflate the global economy more widely it s impossible to know when the market will shift from voting to weighing machine again but the australian dollar rally is running on fumes regardless

tasks in 2017 the 43 year old learnt that his liver has been damaged and his spleen has enlarged the doctor informed me that this was caused by drinking polluted water he tells eos siddique blames the coal power plant for contaminating the groundwater resources of his village he has now stopped drinking tap water and instead gets drinking water from the water supply scheme in qadirabad i was advised complete rest along with heavy medication for six months he says i also had difficulty in breathing and constant headache during this time siddique says polluted water has affected other villagers as well his brother umer hayat s liver was also severely damaged and the doctors gave him the same reason for his illness consuming polluted groundwater doctors have advised him to take medication for the rest of his life villagers say the power plant has impacted not only their health but uprooted the life they once knew they remember the time when they were surrounded by green fields as far as the eye could see they remember what it felt like to breathe fresh air and they remember the sense of ownership they felt towards their land for residents like siddique this loss of ownership was literal one day government officials approached him with an offer to acquire his agricultural land to build the power plant soon he learnt that refusing this offer was not an option muhammad siddique right says drinking polluted water has impacted his health photos by the writer the coal power plant stands in the middle of sahiwal s agricultural land lost land siddique was livid when government officers approached him to buy his land it was our bread and butter where would we go after selling our land he asks siddique did not think he would ever consider the offer he claims he tore the property documents in front of the officials he also started collecting copies of other villagers national identity cards and worked towards stopping the transfer of land for the construction of the sahiwal coal fired power plant his efforts were quickly found out siddique claims a first information report fir with terrorism clauses was moved against him as a scare tactic he also says he was approached by a high ranking district government officer for mediation siddique says the officer made it clear to him that the government will acquire the land no matter what the stakes after all were very high with this project sahiwal had been carefully selected as the home for the coal fired plant after many other sites including sheikhupura muzaffargarh bhikki jhang and rahim yar khan had been considered sahiwal had been given priority due to the presence of a transmission line railway track and irrigation system nearby the 1 320 megawatt mw coal fired power plant would eventually cost 1 8 billon us dollars today the project stands tall with two 660 mw plants and is part of the china pakistan economic corridor cpec project the government buys electricity from the power plant at 8 3601 us cents kilowatt hour and touts the project as a major success aerial view of sahiwal before the construction of the power plant aerial view of sahiwal in february 2019 officers allegedly made the magnitude of the project clear to siddique years ago the farm owner felt dwarfed in comparison lacking the resources or time to fight for his legitimate rights he eventually gave in he still felt that being the main affectees the villagers of qadirabad were in a position to bargain we demanded access to clean drinking water free electricity a small hospital and sui gas and a functioning sewerage system he says siddique claims the officers assured the villagers that these demands would be met but years later none of the facilities have been provided to them it is difficult to cross check these details with the police many of the officers who the villagers speak of no longer work in the region but zeeshan javed deputy commissioner sahiwal tells eos the district administration refuted the allegation regarding adoptive coercive measures to acquire land in fact he says generous compensations were paid to all landholders landholders were also given enough time to harvest he says zaman rasheed wattu who is the station house officer of the noor shah police station located at about a 26 minute drive from the power plant cautions that the villagers claims may be exaggerated this is not possible as the people having land rights can go to courts and get a stay order he says sahiwal had been given priority due to the presence of a transmission line railway track and irrigation system nearby the 1 320 megawatt mw coal fired power plant would eventually cost 1 8 billon us dollars today the project stands tall with two 660 mw plants and is part of the china pakistan economic corridor cpec project wattu says however that he was posted to noor shah just this year and does not have complete details regarding the matter the villagers on the other hand claim to remember the details vividly rana ali hassan is another villager from chak 76 5r who says his luck ran out in 2014 when police marked his land with red flags warning that no one should enter it the police specified the area to mark down the boundaries of the coal fired power plant in qadirabad however hassan along with his fellow villagers mustered the strength to remove those flags they thought the police would not resist their move they were wrong the same night at around 11pm a heavy contingent of police raided our village and unlawfully entered the homes of some people he claims the police misbehaved with those who resisted we didn t want to give away our ancestral land but we had no other option hassan adds we had which we had to sell at the rate of 2 070 000 rupees per acre the farmers allege they weren t even given time to wait for the harvesting season to end i had to harvest the pre mature crop complains hassan unhealthy developments a medical camp was set up in the region in october this year the doctors at the camp report a significant increase in people suffering from breathing problems like siddique and hayat israr khan from chak 76 5r says the sahiwal coal fired power plant has been very detrimental for villagers health my mother is asthmatic now due to increasing air pollution caused by the plant says israr khan whose house is located a few metres away from the power plant dr abdul rauf a senior doctor working in lahore confirms that coal fired power plants can lead to lung diseases especially asthma pneumonitis inflammation of lung tissue and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd the poiso nous fumes and particulate matter emitted from a coal power plant can cause different skin diseases photosensitivity and allergic reaction to the face he adds communities living near the sahiwal coal fired power plant should be relocated he believes higher pollution levels will reduce the amount of oxygen in the local environment and reduce oxygen supply to the brain he says it s actually slow poisoning the adviser to the prime minister on climate change malik amin aslam terms the construction of the sahiwal coal fired power in the agricultural heartland of punjab as criminal neglect this not only affects the agricultural lands around the project he says but also creates issues of long distance transport of coal the environment protection department punjab is responsible for and mandated to monitor the situation and ensure that the project not only abides strictly with its environmental impact assessment but also with the national environmental quality standards for all emissions and effluents adds the minister but naseem ur rehman director eia maintains that air pollution caused by the sahiwal coal fired power plant is well within the limits while commenting upon the efficiency of the power plant he says the sahiwal coal power project uses the highly efficient electrostatic precipitator to control emissions epd punjab is ensuring that all the parameters are adhered we never found emissions to be increasing adds rehman water woes residents of qadirabad say the groundwater table has decreased by up to 15 feet over the last three to four years this could be the result of over pumping of groundwater for utilisation by the coal power says dr nabeel khan niazi a research scientist at the university of agriculture faisalabad the maximum groundwater abstraction for the coal power plant happens during the winter season when canal water is not available from january to march he adds dr niazi is an expert on arsenic dynamics in water he has been investigating the impacts of groundwater abstraction and the rising arsenic levels in sahiwal including nearby villages because of the coal fired power plant the doctor and his team collected up to 220 water samples from electric pumps and hand pumps around villages which were close to the power plant analysis of the samples showed that arsenic concentrations in 45 percent of the samples were above the world health organization s safe limits in drinking water 10 micrograms per litre worse still 30 percent of the well water samples contained arsenic levels above the pakistan epa safe limit which is set at 50 micrograms per litre other water quality parameters that include sulphate chloride and sodium were also higher in 30 to 40 percent of the samples dr niazi adds he says that while the information collected from the survey is preliminary it clearly indicates that there is a potential threat to groundwater quantity and quality in the vicinity of the sahiwal coal power plant which is posing a health risk to the people living there hammad naqi khan the director general of the world wide fund for nature pakistan wwf pakistan was disappointed that the sahiwal coal fired power plant was constructed in the heart of punjab s prime agricultural land it s an environmental disaster as coal has negative consequences on air quality is a water intensive technology and it could affect the fertility of agriculture plains and most importantly exacerbate climate change he says the adviser to the prime minister on climate change malik amin aslam terms the construction of the sahiwal coal fired power in the agricultural heartland of punjab as criminal neglect he insists the project makes little business sense how could you allow a coal power plant to be constructed in an agriculture zone where there are no coal reserves he questions such projects need to be investigated as these so called assets will become liabilities due to high operational maintenance and environmental costs and must not be allowed in the future aslam agrees punjab epd should ensure compliance for all parameters by the sahiwal coal power project and also investigate and duly address any unanticipated issues being faced by the locals including water depletion aslam stresses this project has unfortunately locked us into a long term and self inflicted ecological challenge he says at the moment we would like to ensure that the environmental impact assessment of the project would be strictly adhered to along with meeting the neqs on emissions and effluents of the plant rehman maintains that the environmental impact assessment of the project was conducted beforehand and says his department is ensuring that it has minimum impact on the environment the sahiwal coal fired power plant never violated the national environmental standards says the eia director regardless of the results of official assessments there is little denying the project s environmental impact with pakistan being ranked among the most water stressed countries in the world the sahiwal coal fired power plant that requires 60 000 cubic metres of water daily is not a healthy development the future is renewables a dry guava tree near the coal power plant coal fired power plants contribute up to 38 percent of global electricity according to the world coal association however after increasing awareness about the environmental impacts of coal investments in new coal fired power plants have reduced by 75 percent globally ushering in a new era in the energy paradigm according to a march 2019 energy innovation report in the united states solar and wind energy can replace 74 percent of its coal fleet by 2025 renewable energy would replace 86 percent of the country s coal energy renewables can provide the same amount of electricity more cheaply says the report plummeting cost of electricity generation from wind and solar has led clean energy to become a low cost option in many countries worldwide during may this year the united kingdom enjoyed its first week of not using electricity from coal fired power plants this seems to be the new normal or at least the future most of the world is aspiring towards in september this year when thousands marched around the world during the global climate strike one of their top demands was 100 percent renewable energy generation and exports protesters called for an end to coal dependency in australia chile germany ivory coast kenya kosovo and even pakistan it s not just activists who are demanding change a new coalition of governments and businesses has formed to protect the planet from the impacts of climate change by phasing out coal the powering past coal alliance ppca as 91 members including 32 national governments 25 subnational governments and 34 businesses curiously at a time when most of the developed world is moving towards renewable energy pakistan seems to be relying more heavily on coal powered energy according to the pakistan economy survey 2018 2019 the share of coal in the energy mix which remained stable in single digit percentages over the last two decades climbed to 12 7 percent in the 2018 the ppca was launched by the uk and canada in 2017 and aspires to achieve a transition from coal to renewable energy the coalition believes that a shift from coal power generation to a clean energy mix is vital to limit global temperature rise below two degrees celsius this will further contribute to sustainable economic growth and a safer climate the ppca aims to phase out unabated coal fired electricity generation for the european union eu and organization for economic cooperation and development oecd countries by 2030 and for the rest of the world by 2050 curiously at a time when most of the developed world is moving towards renewable energy pakistan seems to be relying more heavily on coal powered energy according to the pakistan economy survey 2018 2019 the share of coal in the energy mix which remained stable in single digit percentages over the last two decades climbed to 12 7 percent in the 2018 vaqar zakaria an environmental expert provides one possible explanation it s a 30 year agreement and pakistan is obliged to pay capacity charges to the power plant even if it doesn t produce electricity it s a two part tariff with a capacity charge and an operating charge on the subject of air pollution and emissions from power plants zakaria adds that there are control mechanisms but in pakistan the data on air emissions is not made public while pakistan s reliance on coal increased the share of renewables in the country s energy mix which was at 0 3 percent in 2015 rose to mere 1 1 percent in 2018 encouragingly however five wind energy projects of 246 6 mw capacity were completed in 2018 2019 all the plants are operational now what happens in paris in 2015 when construction on the sahiwal coal power project began the drafting of the paris climate agreement finished the agreement aimed to strengthen climate action by limiting global temperatures well below 2 degrees celsius above pre industrial levels and to make efforts to limit temperature rise further to 1 5 degrees celsius pakistan ratified the agreement on november 11 2016 the paris agreement was signed by 197 countries and it required every country to submit a plan of action also known as nationally determined contributions ndcs that entailed how every country planned to limit its carbon emissions and fight climate change science is clear on the fact that coal is exacerbating climate change which leads to catastrophic weather events such as glacial lake outburst floods cyclones and sea intrusion why then is the government of pakistan venturing into coal pakistan s ndc stated that the country s emissions are going to increase four fold by 2030 the document said that a reduction of up to 20 percent of pakistan s projected emissions by 2030 is subject to international support amounting to 40 billion us dollars this support would be in the form of financial grants technical assistance technology development and transfer and capacity building similarly the ndc document mentioned that pakistan needs approximately seven to 14 billion us dollars annually to adapt to the impacts of climate change the document further stated that pakistan needs to exploit all its domestic sources of energy including coal hydro wind and solar and that exploring nuclear and local coal based energy in the power sector would be inevitable in the future ground realities nazir second from right from chak 76 5r along with other locals standing in front of a guava orchard getting dry due to the power plant far from the world of international agreements and policymaking residents of qadirabad continue to struggle nazir a 65 year old villager from chak 76 5r says his maize yield has been impacted because of the coal power plant nazir whose agricultural land is right next to the power plant says that the floodlights that turn on at night at the plant destroy his crops these lights have been installed after every few yards along the walls of the power plant for security purposes along the boundaries of the power plant one can find different crops including maize wheat and rice the floodlights from the power plant affect the productivity of the crops the patches that come under the direct contact of flood lights don t give corn nazir says it s a complete loss for us complains the farmer dr abid mehmood director general at the agriculture department of punjab says that the high beams may be increasing the heat as well it is possible that the floodlights are leading to an increase in temperature in the area which is preventing the vegetative phase from occurring nazir further says that his guava orchard is getting dry the farmer is convinced that air pollutants emitted from the coal power plant are responsible for this tajdin another farmer in the area is facing the same problem 80 percent of guava trees in my orchard are getting dry due to the coal fired power plant he says the ash dumped in the power plant spreads to nearby areas with the wind and settles on guava trees some of these claims are difficult to verify but they indicate how the residents view the power plant it is the source of most of their troubles science is clear on the fact that coal is exacerbating climate change which leads to catastrophic weather events such as glacial lake outburst floods cyclones and sea intrusion why then is the government of pakistan venturing into coal contrary to the findings of the punjab epd the locals of qadirabad complain of bad air quality depleting and deteriorating groundwater and impacts on agriculture it is now up to the government to investigate the matter and address the environmental concerns that the local communities have been raising for years with additional reporting by shafiq

washington impeached or not president donald trump has a strong tailwind heading into his re election year the economy presidential contests tend to turn on it s the economy stupid as democratic strategist james carville summed up underdog bill clinton s win in 1992 and things look good for trump at this time unemployment is at a 50 year low stocks are at all time highs and forecasters project growth into 2020 especially as the trade war with china seems to be easing if the status quo continues he ll win said moody s analytics chief economist mark zandi referring to his presidential prediction model which is based on economic indicators including gas prices and the unemployment rate along with the president s approval rating and projected turnout zandi s is just one of several prediction models that favor trump who also has the benefit of incumbency the president never misses an opportunity to boast about the dow or the latest jobs report and those rosy indicators give other republicans something to run on no matter what s happening in washington for folks running for congress or senate it s something they can and will tout every single day said republican strategist matt gorman so should democrats worry yes said carville everything worries me with democrats in the midst of a presidential primary fight there s widespread agreement among the candidates and their biggest allies that many americans aren t feeling the benefits of a robust economy and that trump can be defeated by highlighting those inequities while liberal megacities are booming rust belt swing states such as pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin have lost thousands of manufacturing jobs this year after an earlier revival due in part to trade disputes and unemployment rates have begun to tick up a bit in dozens of battleground counties in the industrial midwest in wisconsin s marinette county which trump won by 34 points the unemployment rate has climbed a full percentage point in the past year though it s still low historically stocks are up but so are costs democrats say rising health and child care costs ballooning student debt and concerns about retirement savings have left many voters feeling anxious about the future even while others are enjoying the growth of their 401 k accounts half of americans 49 percent worry about an immediate financial need such as paying rent or bills while another quarter of the population have no immediate needs but are concerned about long term financial issues like retirement paying for a child s education and health care costs according to surveys taken by gallup virtually every cost in the life of a middle class family is up and that dynamic is frankly one of the reasons why he won the last election sen bob casey a democrat who represents the key battleground state of pennsylvania said of trump there was a frustration that neither party was addressing that basic problem those issues predated trump but democrats argue he not only failed to address them but also made things worse by undermining the affordable care act and squandering his biggest legislative opportunity on a tax cut that most americans think helped the wealthy and not them those messages have already started to appear in ads run by democratic super pacs like priorities usa which has spent 8 2 million since july on digital ads in swing states presidential candidates also have highlighted rising costs and sluggish wage growth in speeches and ads the idea that trump s strength is on the economy is false said patrick mchugh priorities usa executive director while macro indicators might suggest that the economy is doing all right everyday americans are not feeling that the super pac s extensive polling of battleground states has found voters satisfaction with their economic situation fell 8 percentage points from may to october and their approval of trump s handling of the economy dropped from a net 10 points to an equal number approving and disapproving some nonpartisan polling backs that up a new pew survey found that while 69 percent of americans think the economy is helping the wealthy just 32 percent say it s helping the middle class and only 27 percent say it s helping the poor and 58 percent say the economy is actually hurting the middle class and 64 percent say it s hurting the poor overall though a slight majority of americans 52 percent approve of trump s handling of the economy according to the last nbc news wall street journal poll which is stronger than his overall approval rating of course a lot could change in the next year resisting trump s temperament selling their economic case will depend on democrats not repeating their mistakes of 2016 when they focused on trump s temperament while he focused on telling workers he would bring their jobs back we took a big mirror and projected trump s face on it and said to voters look at how grotesque it is look at how despicable it is and we never really turned the mirrors around to focus on what s actually going on in peoples communities said bradley beychok the president of the democratic super pac american bridge the group plans to spend at least 50 million in 2020 trying to soften up trump s support in conservative areas after having compiled research on 77 counties to try to localize messages about how the president has driven things in the wrong direction on jobs health care costs and more lee saunders the president of the american federation of state county and municipal employees a union that represents 1 4 million mainly public sector workers said democrats have gotten better at talking about bread and butter issues but can t let impeachment take all the oxygen out of the room if you look at the democrats who are running for president right now these folks have started talking about how working families are being left behind he said they want to hear how you re going to help them and benefit them on a day to day level democrats were cautious in criticizing the economy when barack obama was in the white house but the 2020 presidential candidates have been relatively unified in dissecting the economy under trump look beyond the daily headlines about the stock market and the unemployment rate you ll see a grim long term picture of our economy sen elizabeth warren said in an economic speech thursday in new hampshire trump said he s going to take care of the forgotten man he got elected and forgot them former vice president joe biden said in an interview with cnbc last week trump is saying the economy is doing great just look at the stock market and a lot of folks around the country and around here in south bend say what about me mayor pete buttigieg told nbc news harry smith the democratic national committee and state parties plan to highlight what they call trump s broken promises to help forgotten workers for instance in 2017 he traveled to youngstown ohio to assure voters he would revive the struggling manufacturing sector and keep open a nearby g m plant the automaker was threatening to close those jobs have left ohio they re all coming back they re all coming back trump told a cheering crowd don t move don t sell your house g m shuttered the plant this year a recent quinnipiac survey found nearly 6 in 10 americans said they are better off financially now than they were in 2016 while a majority of wisconsin voters 53 percent say they approve of the way trump is handling the economy according to a new poll from marquette law school widely considered the best pollster in the state in fact americans are so deeply polarized that even their view of the economy not what they think should be done about it but just their appraisal of how well it s working today is tied to their partisan identity republicans view of the economy dramatically improved as soon as trump took office while democrats view of it declined even though the economy under the final months of obama s tenure and first few months of trump looked virtually identical today 75 percent of republicans say the economy is excellent or good versus just 41 percent of democrats who say the same according to pew findings like that make carville wonder if in 2020 it really still is the economy stupid trump is impervious to everything good or bad he just stays at 41 7 carville said referring to the

source coal producers demand forex payments ebusiness weekly december 13 2019 martin kadzere zimbabwe s coal producers are making a push to be partly paid in foreign currency by zesa after the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz recently directed the state owned power utility to bill exporters in hard currency an industry body has said coal producers makomo resources hwange colliery company and zambezi gas supplies about 90 percent of their output to zesa s four thermal power stations including hwange the country s largest power plant after kariba hydroelectric plant the power utility also owns three small power plants in harare munyati and bulawayo recently the central bank directed through a statutory instrument zesa to bill exporters in foreign currency with the proceeds going towards importation of power equipment and payment of foreign loans and foreign insurance premiums the rbz said zesa shall be allowed to bill in united states dollars or the equivalent in euro or any other currency for the supply of electricity to exporters and partial exporters earning their revenue or receiving their income in forex chairman of coal producers association ray mutokonyi told business weekly in an interview that foreign currency availability was critical in the electricity value chain and wants part of forex being earned by the power utility to also benefit the miners forex shortages fuel and electricity characterise zimbabwe s economic challenges the miners require foreign currency to procure production inputs and other consumables such as explosives but have not been getting enough on the interbank market foreign currency availability is important to ensure enough production of coal for power since zesa is now being paid in foreign currency by exporters as coal producers we feel a portion should be put to production we need foreign currency to import consumables which is critical for our operations through the chamber of mines we have done a paper to present this position to our parent ministry mines and mining development the reserve bank energy and power development and finance and economic development ministries zesa acting chief executive engineer patrick chivaura said the forex received by the power utility had prescribed uses in terms of the law it would be difficult for zesa to then apply same to local suppliers without breaking the provision of the statutory instrument said eng chivaura mutokonyi however said by allowing zesa to bill exporters in hard currency the utility s domestic currency revenue would substantially fall and this would in turn negatively affect its ability to pay for local services including the coal supplies what this has done is to take away local currency that has been financing local production through coal payments as exporter s money will now go towards power imports already zesa owes coal miners nearly 108 million and this was compounding challenges to buy foreign currency on the interbank market zesa is always behind in terms of payments we have talked to the executive chairman dr sydney gata and he has assured us that he will look into the matter said mutokonyi eng chivaura confirmed the debt but said half of the amount was due for payment serious efforts are being made to pay as regularly as we can an on a weekly basis and payments will be sustained until the debt is cleared said eng chivaura coal remains the dominant energy mineral for zimbabwe the country boasts of vast reserves of coal particularly in the north west and southern parts of the country coal intake at the power station will significantly increase when zimbabwe power company an electricity generating subsidiary of zesa commissions additional two units by end of 2021 the units are expected to produce 600 megawatts the us 1 billion project being implemented by sino hydro of china is 25 percent complete recently zpc claimed inadequate supplies of coal by the miners was threating the country s power generation and wanted to produce its own fuel for guaranteed supplies with the coming in of stage 7 and 8 zpc said it was concerned that the existing miners might fail to adequately provide feed stock for the expanded power station hwange thermal station is currently the base load power plant in light of declining production at kariba hydroelectric due to low water level at lake kariba the zambezi river authority which manages the zambezi water resources said the hydrological situation remains dire indicating a possible suspension of power generation by january zimbabwe and zambia generate electricity from lake kariba
this article is more than 4 years old this survey of high payout funds will steer you to the bargains and warn you of the pitfalls getty stocks and bonds yield 2 these days that s problematic if you had in mind withdrawing 4 a year from your savings wall street s answer to this predicament a rich menu of exchange traded funds with high yields here i will highlight the best funds in seven different investing styles that deliver outsized payouts among them funds that own junk bonds funds that invest in pipeline partnerships and funds that own european stocks i see these funds as useful even for investors who are not seeking current income they offer diversification they don t behave exactly like either the high grade bond funds or the s p 500 funds that probably account for the bulk of your savings but before you dive in ponder two things one is that handsome yields always come with a cost in either higher risk or diminished growth no dividend is a free lunch the other matter is that distributions aren t the only way to get cash to live on you could always sell a few shares of a fund you could that is skip the yield chase and instead put your money in something more conventional like the vanguard balanced index fund when that yields 2 you d get the rest of a 4 spending target by liquidating 2 of your shares every year if selling shares isn t to your liking or you just want to diversify into categories not well covered with a plain old balanced fund then look at portfolios containing these yield spewing securities 1 high yield domestic stocks numerous etfs aim at big company stocks with yields higher than average some of them charge minuscule fees and you can find the bargains in the best etfs for investors dividend funds report you ll find vanguard high dividend yield and schwab u s dividend equity at the top of this cost efficiency ranking they both yield 3 more or less and they both emphasize blue chips like exxon mobil and verizon communications you can reach out a little further for yield the spdr portfolio s p 500 high dividend etf from state street whose fees are a tad higher has pushed its yield well above 4 it owns the likes of newell brands and nordstrom what did we say about yield coming with higher risk or lower growth newell can scarcely be said to be covering its generous dividend it s in the red nordstrom is making good money but it s in a dying industry if you want equities that pay fat dividends you can get them just know what you re getting 2 high yield overseas stocks it s easy to put together a collection of foreign stocks with nice yields because dividend paying is more of a habit outside the u s especially in europe the xtrackers msci eafe high dividend yield hedged equity etf yields 4 7 net of fund fees an affordable 0 2 holdings include total the french oil company zurich insurance group known here as farmers insurance and japan tobacco slightly cheaper and considerably narrower state street s spdr solactive united kingdom with an expense ratio of 0 14 its largest positions are in hsbc the bank and bp the oil company as always high yield low growth the european economy is sleepier than ours also european companies tend to spend less than american ones on stock buybacks a buyback is like a reinvested dividend trading today s cash for tomorrow s price appreciation euro funds belong in a taxable account where you can claim a credit for the foreign taxes withheld from your dividends in an ira the foreign taxes don t do as much good they simply reduce the taxable income you will someday pull out of the account forbes 3 junk bonds ious from shaky companies pay high interest to make up for the fact that some of those borrowers won t pay you back in the forbes ranking of cost effective junk bond etfs xtrackers usd high yield corporate bond is the winner it s on our etf honor roll the xtrackers junk fund has a yield of 5 9 reports morningstar i like this fund but don t be deluded about what you re going to get from it that reported yield is calculated before subtracting bad debt losses which might average 1 to 2 a year over a full economic cycle subtract another 1 to 2 for inflation now subtract something for the adverse selection in this business good borrowers prepay their bonds cheating you out of those high coupons your portfolio becomes concentrated in loans to weak borrowers what s the likely real return on a junk portfolio somewhere around 2 spend the whole 5 9 if you want to but understand what you re doing you re spending a real return of 2 and then liquidating your principal at a rate of 3 9 you won t notice this principal erosion every year especially not if the economy is booming and inflation tame but you will see it over time 4 pipeline securities partnerships and corporations that own oil and gas pipelines gush out fat distributions you can own pieces of these things via exchange traded funds two etfs i like are tortoise north american pipeline and global x mlp energy infrastructure they both have portfolios mixing the units of master limited partnerships with the shares of corporations they both have fairly modest yields in the range of 4 to 6 two cautions apply one is that transporting fossil fuel has an even more questionable future than does running a department store someday the carbon will be displaced not soon but it will happen and when it does you ll own buried scrap metal the other more subtle problem is that many pipeline etfs reach for yield by loading up on partnerships like plains all american pipeline as opposed to corporations like oneok the partnerships tend to have nicer payouts in part because they owe no corporate income tax but if a fund has more than 25 of its portfolio in partnerships it has to allow for corporate income tax on the fund itself when partnership units fare badly in the stock market as they have done in recent years the future tax liability doesn t have any impact on the fund s performance but when the sector rebounds and presumably you re investing with that expectation the fund s tax bill will hit you in the form of a savagely high expense ratio i explain the problem and list the funds to avoid in tax guide to mlp funds 5 reits real estate investment trusts more precisely the subset that call themselves equity reits rent out office buildings strip malls apartments and other kinds of property and pay fairly good dividends out of that revenue stream an etf is an excellent way to get your hands on this income as always you have a trade off between growth and income the ishares core u s reit etf is my favorite among growth tilting reit funds it owns classy reits like equinix data centers and prologis warehouses for e commerce it yields just under 3 it wins the cost efficiency competition detailed in our best etfs sector funds review for a higher current payout use the invesco kbw premium yield equity reit etf it owns weaker companies with fatter dividends like washington prime group shopping centers its yield tops 6 fund fees are considerably higher than on the ishares product 6 preferred stocks with straight preferreds which are the main offering in preferred stock etfs you get a dividend yield double or more what you might have had on common shares in return for that you give up any prospect of growth preferred stocks of good companies act much like junk bonds of bad companies they couple high current income with the occasional loss of principal the loss comes when a bond defaults or a preferred suspends its dividend there are also nicks to principal when a security bought at a premium price gets called in at par these capital fluctuations go in one direction there are no windfall gains from good companies to make up for the windfall losses on bad ones the best buy in this category is the spdr wells fargo preferred stock etf it offsets half its 0 45 expense ratio with income from securities lending the payout yield has recently been close to 6 although allowing for the early calls would knock a percentage point off that number 7 bonds from junk countries you can get a nice coupon on sovereign bonds from emerging countries especially if the borrower is planning to repay you in its own iffy currency my choices in this category are from the blackrock ishares and vaneck vectors families both with j p morgan emerging markets local currency bond etf in the label these competing products carry the same 0 3 annual expense burden they differ in their recent payout rates 3 4 and 6 5 respectively but have similar holdings with similar yields to maturity of the bonds largest allocations are to brazil indonesia mexico thailand and south africa you can get hosed if a borrower either devalues its currency or decides that lenders are undeserving of repayment indeed despite nice yields the funds have delivered five year total returns below 1 a year maybe better times are ahead in their recent 2020 market outlook the experts at the blackrock investment institute called out emerging market local currency debt as due for outperformance their call is predicated on a continuation of the dovish monetary policies now in place in developed economies they are offering no guarantee they will be right
reuters ben nelms an alternative for world military conflicts u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin on saturday rejected the suggestion that the trump administration is weaponizing the dollar through its trade restricting policies with other countries let me be clear we are not weaponizing the u s dollar mnuchin told cnbc s hadley gamble at the doha forum in qatar if anything i would say the opposite i take great responsibility that people use the dollar as the reserve currency of the world and the dollar is quite strong sometimes the president says the dollar is too strong the dollar is strong because of the u s economy and because people want to hold dollars and the safety of the u s dollar so because of that we take sanctions responsibility very seriously as a matter of fact i personally sign off on every single piece of sanction that we do officials in china and europe have been actively promoting their currencies as substitutes for the dollar when it comes to both reserves and transactions particularly in the face of expanding u s sanctions and protectionist trade policies like tariffs according to the treasury department this has stunted the ability of european allies and others to trade with iran among other countries and entities so some states are therefore looking to euros and other alternatives including chinese renminbi and cryptocurrencies to carry out trade free of u s imposed restrictions earlier this year france germany and the u k set up the instrument in support of trade exchanges instex which uses euros to bypass u s sanctions on iran russia s central bank has also been trying to reduce the number of transactions conducted in u s dollars either for domestic payments or foreign trade since 2013 and in 2016 china s renminbi was added to the international monetary fund s special drawing rights basket in 2016 along with the dollar euro yen and british pound something the imf said enhances the attractiveness of the rmb as an international reserve asset still just to highlight one sector 80 of european energy imports are settled in dollars something that european commission president jean claude juncker in 2018 called absurd sanctions like those on iran mnuchin said are used in order to avoid potential war the reason why we re using sanctions is because and i believe it s worked the secretary said so whether it s north korea whether it s iran or other places in the world we take the responsibility very seriously there is debate as to whether the administration s maximum pressure policy on iran is working to meet u s objectives while it has certainly crippled iran s economy currency and its ability to export oil and provocative attacks the u s and its allies have attributed to iran have increased while the dollar looks set to retain its preeminence in global markets mnuchin admitted that there has to be a balance in setting policies that police international trade people don t have to use the dollar we have the right to put restrictions on people using the dollar and over a long period of time if we re not careful people will look at using other currencies indeed the dollar s role as the premier reserve currency is receding though very slowly the dollar s share of foreign reserves decreased from a high of 73 in 2001 to 62 at the end of 2018 according to imf data and the world gold council reported that central banks bought more gold in 2018 than at any other time since the gold standard ended in 1971 wrote james mccormack an analyst for fitch ratings in june of this year
by alex seitz wald with nbc news politics the president points to strong numbers on several fronts but his rivals for the white house paint a different picture advertisement washington impeached or not president donald trump has a strong tailwind heading into his re election year the economy presidential contests tend to turn on it s the economy stupid as democratic strategist james carville famously summed up underdog bill clinton s win in 1992 and things look good for trump at this time unemployment is at a 50 year low stocks are at all time highs and forecasters project growth into 2020 especially as the trade war with china seems to be easing if the status quo continues he ll win said moody s analytics chief economist mark zandi referring to his presidential prediction model which is based on economic indicators including gas prices and the unemployment rate along with the president s approval rating and projected turnout zandi s is just one of several prediction models that favor trump who also has the benefit of incumbency the president never misses an opportunity to boast about the dow or the latest jobs report and those rosy indicators give other republicans something to run on no matter what s happening in washington for folks running for congress or senate it s something they can and will tout every single day said republican strategist matt gorman so should democrats worry yes said carville everything worries me with democrats in the midst of a presidential primary fight there s widespread agreement among the candidates and their biggest allies that many americans aren t feeling the benefits of a robust economy and that trump can be defeated by highlighting those inequities while liberal megacities are booming rust belt swing states such as pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin have lost thousands of manufacturing jobs this year after an earlier revival due in part to trade disputes and unemployment rates have begun to tick up a bit in dozens of battleground counties in the industrial midwest in wisconsin s marinette county which trump won by 34 points the unemployment rate has climbed a full percentage point in the past year though it s still low historically stocks are up but so are costs democrats say rising health and child care costs ballooning student debt and concerns about retirement savings have left many voters feeling anxious about the future even while others are enjoying the growth of their 401 k accounts half of americans 49 percent worry about an immediate financial need such as paying rent or bills while another quarter of the population have no immediate needs but are concerned about long term financial issues like retirement paying for a child s education and health care costs according to surveys taken by gallup virtually every cost in the life of a middle class family is up and that dynamic is frankly one of the reasons why trump won the last election said sen bob casey a democrat who represents the key battleground state of pennsylvania there was a frustration that neither party was addressing that basic problem those issues predated trump but democrats argue he not only failed to address them but also made things worse by undermining the affordable care act and squandering his biggest legislative opportunity on a tax cut that most americans thinkhelped the wealthy and not them those messages have already started to appear in ads run by democratic super pacs like priorities usa which has spent 8 2 million since july on digital ads in swing states presidential candidates also have highlighted rising costs and sluggish wage growth in speeches and ads the idea that trump s strength is on the economy is false said patrick mchugh priorities usa executive director while macro indicators might suggest that the economy is doing alright everyday americans are not feeling that advertisement the super pac s extensive polling of battleground states has found voters satisfaction with their economic situation fell 8 percentage points from may to october and their approval of trump s handling of the economy dropped from a net 10 points to an equal number approving and disapproving some nonpartisan polling backs that up a new pew survey found that while 69 percent of americans think the economy is helping the wealthy just 32 percent say it s helping the middle class and only 27 percent say it s helping the poor and 58 percent say the economy is actually hurting the middle class and 64 percent say it s hurting the poor overall though a slight majority of americans 52 percent approve of trump s handling of the economy according to the last nbc news wall street journal poll which is stronger than his overall approval rating of course a lot could change in the next year resisting trump s temperament selling their economic case will depend on democrats not repeating their mistakes of 2016 when they focused on trump s temperament while he focused on telling workers he would bring their jobs back advertisement we took a big mirror and projected trump s face on it and said to voters look at how grotesque it is look at how despicable it is and we never really turned the mirrors around to focus on what s actually going on in peoples communities said bradley beychok the president of the democratic super pac american bridge the group plans to spend at least 50 million in 2020 trying to soften up trump s support in conservative areas after having compiled research on 77 counties to try to localize messages about how the president driven things in the wrong direction on jobs health care costs and more lee saunders the president of afscme a union that represents 1 4 million mainly public sector workers said democrats have gotten better at talking about bread and butter issues but can t let impeachment take all the oxygen out of the room if you look at the democrats who are running for president right now these folks have started talking about how working families are being left behind he said they want to hear how you re going to help them and benefit them on a day to day level democrats were cautious with their criticism of the economy when barack obama was still in the white house but the 2020 presidential candidates have been relatively unified in dissecting the trump economy advertisement look beyond the daily headlines about the stock market and the unemployment rate you ll see a grim long term picture of our economy sen elizabeth warren said in an economic speech she delivered in new hampshire on thursday trump said he s going to take care of the forgotten man he got elected and forgot them former vice president joe biden said in an interview with cnbc last week trump is saying the economy is doing great just look at the stock market and a lot of folks around the country and around here in south bend say what about me mayor pete buttigieg told nbc news harry smith the democratic national committee and state parties plan to highlight what they call trump s broken promises to help forgotten workers for instance in 2017 he traveled to youngstown ohio to assure voters he would revive the struggling manufacturing sector and keep open a nearby g m plant the automaker was threatening to close those jobs have left ohio they re all coming back they re all coming back trump told a cheering crowd don t move don t sell your house g m shuttered the plant this year a recent quinnipiac survey found nearly six in 10 americans said they are better off financially now than they were in 2016 while a majority of wisconsin voters 53 percent say they approve of the way trump is handling the economy according to a new poll from marquette law school widely considered the best pollster in the state advertisement in fact americans are so deeply polarized that even their view of the economy not what they think should be done about it but just their appraisal of how well it s working today is tied to their partisan identity republicans view of the economy dramatically improved as soon as trump took office while democrats view of it declined even though the economy under the final months of president barack obama s tenure and first few months of trump looked virtually identical today 75 percent of republicans say the economy is excellent or good versus just 41 percent of democrats who say the same according to pew findings like that make carville wonder if in 2020 it really still is the economy stupid trump is impervious to everything good or bad he just stays at 41 7 carville said referring to the president s approval rating in fivethirtyeight com s average i don t care how many good stories about the economy come i don t care about how many bad stories come it still comes up 41 7
the markets were rocked by three key events last week uk election us china trade deal and fomc rate decision sterling ended as the strongest one last week as boosted by the conservative s landslide victory in uk election removing a large of of brexit uncertainty canadian dollar followed crude oil higher as partly boosted by us china trade deal yen was the weakest one on strong risk appetite as us stocks extended record runs dollar followed as the second weakest after fed chair jerome powell dampened the chance of any rate hike soon indicating that interest rate will stay at current level unless there is material surprise in inflation meanwhile actions in the markets late friday suggested investor s ecstasy might not last long dow showed hesitation in its upward push 10 year yield suffered steep decline yuan s rebound reversed while aud jpy also retreated sharply before close we believe that a large part of investors were unhappy with the tiny tariff rollbacks brought by the us china trade deal the early part of the upcoming will be important to gauge the commitment of the optimists brexit uncertainty largely removed by uk election a large part of brexit uncertainty should now be moved as boris johnson is set to return the withdrawal agreement bill for debate in the commons before christmas and passage before january 31 brexit deadline as he also pledged not to extend the transition period beyond 2020 there would be just eleven month for uk and eu to complete the negotiations on future relationship including trade that s a rather tight schedule but for now sterling bulls have every reason to enjoy the ride first markets seemed unhappy with the tiny tariff rollbacks the completion of us china trade deal phase one was another strong boost the the markets according the the fact sheet by us trade representative the agreement could cover areas including intellectual property technology transfer agriculture financial services currency expanding trade and dispute resolution robert lighthizer said he expected the 86 page agreement to be signed by him and chinese vice premier liu he in early january in washington the details will be released then one important thing to note is that markets seem to be very much dissatisfied with the tiny tariff rollbacks the positive news was that the scheduled tariffs on usd 160b in all essentially untaxed chinese goods are suspended indefinitely the 15 tariffs on usd 120b tranche of chinese imports will be halved to 7 5 however the 25 tariffs on usd 250b goods are left unchanged that is the tariff situation is not much better than it was six months ago reactions from dow treasury yield yuan and even aud jpy late friday showed that investors weren t too happy it will take some more time for the reactions to evolve and let s see dow failed to close at record as some investors hesitated all three major us stock indices hit extended long term up trend and hit new record highs last week s p 500 close at 3168 80 and nasdaq s close at 8734 88 were both records too however dow s at 28135 38 was indeed below the record close at 28164 00 made on november 27 that s to us a sign of hesitation despite the trade deal technically dow will be facing 100 projection of 24680 57 to 27398 68 from 25743 46 at 28461 57 long term projection level of 61 8 projection of 15450 56 to 26951 81 from 21712 53 at 2820 30 is not to far away too in case of further rally we might see strong resistance between these two levels to bring pull back meanwhile break of 27801 80 support will indicate short term topping and bring a test on 55 day ema now at 27475 84 first 10 year yield failed to stand above 1 9 handle 10 year yield rebounded to as high as 1 924 on thursday but then dropped sharply to close the week at 1 819 nevertheless overall outlook is unchanged consolidation pattern from 1 429 is in progress and would extended further as long as 1 693 minor support holds further rise through 1 971 resistance is in favor technically that would be a real sign of optimism if happens but even so upside should be limited by 38 2 retracement of 3 248 to 1 429 at 2 123 which is close to 55 week ema at 2 117 meanwhile break of 1 693 support will bring retest of 1 429 low yuan bulls refused to commit despite trade deal usd cnh dived to as low as 6 9214 last week as off shore yuan surged on news of trade deal but the pair then recovered strongly to close above 7 handle at 7 0002 outlook is unchanged that price actions from 7 1953 are merely developing into a corrective pattern the channeling supports this view in case of another fall downside should be contained by 61 8 retracement of 6 6699 to 7 1953 at 6 8706 to bring rebound on the upside break of 7 0867 resistance will suggest that the corrective has completed and bring retest of 7 1953 high but a firm break there is unlikely as it s close to 100 projection of 6 0153 to 6 9868 from 6 2354 at 7 2069 aud jpy failed take out 76 28 structural resistance aud jpy is usually seen as a pair that gauges risk appetite well in particular sentiments of asian traders the cross hit as high as 75 97 last week as rise from 69 95 resumed however it then failed to push through 76 28 structural resistance and retreated sharply to close at 75 18 it s another sign of lack of commitment of risk seekers with 76 28 resistance intact we d still treat rebound from 69 95 as a corrective move break of 73 82 low will turn near term outlook bearish for retesting 69 95 low nevertheless sustained break of 76 28 will add to the case of medium term bullish reversal and target 80 71 key resistance is medium term gbp jpy weekly outlook gbp jpy s rise from 126 54 accelerated to as high as 147 95 last week and took out medium term trend line resistance decisively as a temporary top was formed after subsequent retreat initial bias is neutral this week for some consolidations first downside should be contained above 142 47 support to bring rise resumption on the upside above 147 95 will target 148 87 structural resistance next in the bigger picture rise from 126 54 could either be the third leg of the consolidation pattern from 122 75 2016 low or the start of a new up trend in either case further rally is expected as long as 139 31 support holds into 148 87 156 59 resistance zone reaction from there should reveal which case it should be in rejection from there will extend long term range trading decisive break of 156 69 will carry long term bullish implications in the longer term picture in spite of the current strong rally there is no confirmation of long term bullish reversal yet focus is now on 156 59 key resistance as long as it holds another decline through 122 75 could still be seen but firm break of 156 69 should at least bring further rally to 61 8 retracement of 195 86 to 122 75 at 167 93

on june 1 2017 president trump announced his intent to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement this intent was reiterated in a december 2018 meeting of the parties thus the us is on the trajectory of becoming that free rider from a strategic point of view we are reminded that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial and independent impact on us government policy while average citizens and mass based interest groups have little or no independent influence gilens 2014 given the present situation and dynamics of free riders the critical question is where are the us economic elites going strangely my impression is that our economic elites are in a bind indeed they obtained huge benefits through the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the nonpartisan congressional budget office reported that under the act individuals and pass through entities like partnerships and s corporations would receive about 1 125 billion in net benefits i e net tax cuts offset by reduced healthcare subsidies over ten years while corporations would receive around 320 billion in benefits the only catch here is that this represents a continuation of the story of economic inequality the top one percent had real income after transfers and taxes 225 percent greater than that in 1979 as compared to 41 percent for the middle class from 1989 to 2018 the top 1 percent increased its total net worth by 21 trillion the bottom 50 percent saw its net worth decrease by 900 billion over the same period in 2018 dollars bruenig 2019 the american dream of upward mobility has been dramatically weakened with many families taking on multiple jobs trying to pay higher education health care and adequate housing some financial elites are beginning to wonder if this is good for america and the market shortsighted executives may be satisfied with an american economy whose firms win in global markets without lifting us living standards but any leader with a long view understands that business has a profound stake in the prosperity of the average american vladmanis 2014 another part of the economic elite the managers of big oil have been hyper active promoting more sales of fossil fuels and the weakening of environmental regulation involving their products the petroleum industry may have made a compromise with the automotive sector avoiding two auto emission standards and two markets for future vehicles an absurd and anti economic situation apparently finally abandoned thanks to the resistance of california and other states naturally carbon pricing is off the agenda along with modifying the massive oil subsidies big tech another critical component of the economic elite has avoided any constraining legislation what tech and all of us did not get with trump was an infrastructure program which could have had many features of a green economy such as the use of more renewables decentralized energy production energy efficient buildings of course the oil industry would be opposed to this version of infrastructure big tech does not conduct a significant amount of research on climate change some loners like bill gates through his foundation are running some pilot experiments tech may believe that science and technology can solve everything still it seems they are applying their new super tool artificial intelligence primarily to lower labor costs or to get more information about us consumers and forecast and change our purchasing habits if one takes climate change seriously they are solving the wrong problems are they going to sit out climate change in fire protected villas or allocate needed funds for technological research on climate warming what about supporting an arpa for climate research international banks are getting a bit uneasy about the prospects of the fossil fuel industry in a new draft policy the european investment bank pledged to stop funding of fossil infrastructure projects by the end of next year in addition stock prices of the oil and gas sector of the s p total markets index have been declining five years for a variety of reasons but one issue is what happens if there is more adherence to the paris agreement some banks are prohibiting investments in new coal projects the most damaging source in terms of local air pollution and deaths instead they are actively financing renewable energy projects recently 225 of the world s largest 500 companies participating in a continuing disclosure survey for climate change reported substantial risks to climate change but with potential opportunities outweighing the risks they also had higher rates of board oversight and stakeholder scrutiny of climate related issues and higher rates of potential reputational risks the top four drivers for potential financial impact are increased revenue through demand for low emission products and services better competitive position to reflect shifting consumer preferences increased revenue through new solutions to adaption needs and increased capital availability as more investors favor low emissions producers cdp 2019 these global producers appear to operate in an environment quite different from the us situation in my opinion the primary short term stumbling blocks for the us economic elites are the economic and international uncertainties generated by the trump administration a return to protectionism is not helpful nor is the lack of trust of america in trade and foreign relations this could be improved with new elections two essential issues remain how to deal with climatic and economic injustice mother nature will keep reminding us of our progress or lack thereof in combating climate warming all the recent forest fires from brazil to california should be a wake up call the hollowing out of the middle class also due to unfavorable globalization is not going away and may eventually find a more articulate political voice in other words the us economic elites at least in part could go for green infrastructure some carbon taxes and higher income lower taxes for the middle and lower classes it is a shift to the left but in their best interests and more in line with the international situation this implies a potential conflict of interests between the oil industry and the others what the economic elites and many others keep underestimating is the race against time with climate change not only does it cost much more if you delay investing in climate abatement but there may be a point where it will become apparent that additional economic growth is the problem energy intensity is declining at around 0 4 percent a year to hit midcentury global de carbonization targets global energy intensity needs to decline by between 4 and 10 percent a year that means the world should accelerate efficiency and electrification rates by about ten times ren21 2019 diverse rebound effects are working against rapid improvements in energy intensity as reported by the european environmental bureau parrique 2019 not meeting these targets implies a much warmer climate higher costs lower productivity and even more drastic needs for intensity reductions which we eventually may not be able to achieve if we get to the necessity of de growth this will challenge our traditional capitalistic model and make the economic inequalities practically impossible to justify the kings indeed will be nude united consumers and labor unions may make a difference in forcing a change in the model as occurred in germany where labor participates in management economic

workers and investors got an early christmas gift with a blowout november jobs report that showed the u s economy is still capable of creating jobs and sustaining wage gains above the rate of inflation but the fly in the ointment is persistent trade war worry it indicates that the labor market is defying gravity as we enter the end of the year said glassdoor com senior economist daniel zhao economists said the addition of 266 000 new jobs nearly all of which 254 000 came from the private sector reflected how the labor market is pulling the disengaged and underemployed off the sidelines the labor market continues to be more than robust enough to continue to absorb new workers the unemployment and underemployment rates are going down at the same time said sameer samana senior global market strategist at the wells fargo investment institute the two numbers often have an inverse relationship he said moving in tandem is an indication that there is a demand for more workers and that the labor force is meeting that demand at 63 2 percent the labor force participation rate has tracked at roughly the same level for the past four months it shows you there s a quite a bit of dynamism in the u s labor market samana said job seekers need to take advantage of it there s definitely pockets of growth and there s going to be pockets of decline said irina novoselsky ceo at careerbuilder com the supply and demand trends are very different in different zip codes she said those uneven rates of job growth could be holding back wage gains at an annualized 3 1 percent wage growth is still slightly below what many economists would consider a healthy range of 3 5 to 4 percent although market observers said the persistently low rate of inflation helps mitigate that it s faster than the rate of inflation greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com said of the wage growth rate we are seeing some growth in consumer buying power albeit modest he said if you look at the six month average you can see that there s been a continued deceleration in payrolls growth especially in manufacturing there s been a clear deceleration in wage growth samana said although he added that this trend does have a silver lining for companies when you start to meaningfully accelerate north of 3 percent that s when profit margins come under pressure he said market experts worried that a looming tranche of tariffs on 156 billion in chinese made consumer goods could drive up corporate expenses in unpredictable ways and more importantly hurt consumer buying power those tariffs are much more geared towards the u s consumer and if the u s consumer were to start to feel their costs rise meaningfully most people don t have a lot of excess savings samana said the consumer spends until they start to worry about their financial situation when combined with the cost pressures of tariffs a tight labor market could create inflation more quickly than demand for workers alone we re pretty concerned about the overall impact on inflation said john bredemus chief investment officer at allianz investment management higher inflation could drive up mortgage rates and contribute to a rising dollar a headwind for u s multinational firms for this reason some economists were less sanguine about the longer term outlook in spite of november s outsized job gains questioning whether the positive reading was too good to be true it seems like a candidate for a big downward revision said ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics who characterized the report as an outlier in a client note a repeat of this performance in december would be a different story but we think downside correction is more likely he said economists said that while the effects of new tariffs wouldn t be immediate they would be hard to mitigate once set into play that does bear watching as we move into 2020 any tariffs that take effect and particularly those that hit the consumer pocketbook do pose a stiffer headwind mcbride said with consumer spending the key driver of today s economy in the face of anemic corporate investment anything that makes americans less willing or able to buy goods and services could spread the trade war s impact far beyond the manufacturing sector i think the concern is that as the dec 15 tariffs roll around if we don t have a trade agreement in place by then there is the potential that the trade war spills over into other sectors zhao said

at the dawn of 2020 two precious words sweet oil will be on the lips of every patriotic guyanese it will be guyana s magic moment of first oil it will be the beginning of a promising rags to riches epic a composite of cinderella and the pauper to prince surreal fairytales amidst rising expectations that guyana will soon lead regional economic growth and from press disclosures yesterday exxonmobil still clings to hope for its first oil production from its liza one deposits this december month end according to the economic commission for latin america and the caribbean eclac guyana s growth rate is projected at 85 6 per cent next year as compared to 4 5 per cent at the end of 2019 elsewhere projections from the international monetary fund imf and the giant trillion dollar stock broker nasdaq have placed guyana at the top of the five fastest growing economies in the world the other countries are ethiopia rwanda bangladesh and india guyana at the top these disclosures should give us reasons to feel good about ourselves that guyana is clawing herself back to the top when she was once glorified as the breadbasket of the caribbean the good news reverberate in my heart like the nostalgic lyrics of ben e king and the drifters when they sung about this magic moment being so different and so new and sweeter than wine like every humble guyanese in the context of the oil era we hope even unrealistically so that it could last forever till the end of time there is nothing wrong for us to feel this way to have our moment of upliftment even pride our guyanese people are already basking over the prospects of the better life they are caught up in a shopping frenzy to receive the good news of first oil with the brightest christmas ever this time around they determined that no treacherous political grinch should steal christmas from them first oil should come like our guyana joy which we gladly share with the world doomsday picture but already the naysayers are busy at work they are busy painting a doomsday picture that the foreign oil producers will steal all of our new wealth they publish daily anonymous advertisements the cowardly publishers obviously with deep money lined pockets do not reveal their crooked identities one such fear mongering paid advertisement in yesterday s kaieteur news read inter alia do you know what happens when private companies strike oil in developing countries like guyana them busy shipping away all yoh oil wealth from right under your nose leaving many countries dirt poor and billions in debt after the oil companies leave this is the kind of sleaze that our guyanese people who hope for betterment have to cope with from those pessimists they would rather out of an insane obsession or naked spite that we leave our projected six billion barrels of oil right there at the bottom of our sea fences erected our government has erected fences to protect our oil wealth we have set up a natural resources fund nrf under an act of parliament to manage the natural resource wealth of guyana for the present and future benefit of the people and for the sustainable development of the country but elements from the doomsday gang are clawing at the fund hoping to tear it apart or pull it down even before the first dollar from oil is deposited into it they are opposed to audits of oil revenues being done by the competent state authority guyana revenue authority gra out of a perfidious self interest they are demanding that these audits should be farmed out to private entities y2k fears like a new breed the y2k 20 they are spinning similar fears as in 2000 when doomsday prophets spun the yard that the world would come to an end at the dawn of the new century i recall in 2000 how widespread was the fear that the computer system would crash the power grid would shut down and there would an electronic meltdown business would come to a halt traffic will be chaotic trains will go berserk etc otherwise intelligent people then believed in the big bluff while visiting my old guyana born friend joe in the us midwest he showed me the expensive stove that he had installed in his basement he had stalks of wood both inside the basement and outside in the yard he was preparing for the y2k implosion and for him a near real crash of the electric grid he stacked up an entire expanded cupboard packed with canned foods and dried meats i can understand when fears spring from lack of information which was the situation many years ago during my childhood at sunset i stood at the side of my mother who had squatted before a basket of fresh fish on the bridge to our house at whim village on the corentyne the revered aged village fish vendor kabollay approached us she was hysterical with tears trickling down her face she pointed towards some dark lines in the western sky there were flashes of lights beyond the dark lines de world coming to end chunoo she said to ma kalyug coming chunoo the dark lines turned out to be new telephone wires that were installed earlier that day from the public road to the whim post office and the police station it was the first time that i too was seeing the wires that were strapped to tall poles and the frightful flashing lights emanated from contraptions at the coney island circus some distance away in canje or new amsterdam i survived kabollay s kalyug and the y2k fraud i am just too old now to believe this new yarn that with oil wealth guyana will go down the dark hole of eternal damnation and perdition as i write i am singing in my mind this magic moment and like all right minded guyanese i will not be bothered by these doomsday ghouls according to the oxford dictionary they are persons morbidly interested in disaster and death and would rob graves and feed on dead bodies if ever they should return to power we have learned over these past years since 2015 when the apnu afc coalition government came to office that we could quickly distance ourselves from the dreaded past when we experienced the politics of broken promises corruption and failures we have collectively said no more we have moved forward in these four plus years guyana stable and peaceful elsewhere there is turmoil the mighty president trump has been cited for two counts of abuse of power and will face formal impeachment charges former bolivian president eva morales who was first granted asylum in mexico has been received as a political refugee in argentina he too faces claims that he had abused power in chile the president is accused with abuse of power in using excessive force against citizens and in the uk the labour party suffered its worst defeat ever at the december 12 polls at the hands of prime minister boris johnson s conservative party they say that labour was rejected because it had lost touch with the working people here in guyana those who are beating the dead drum of desperation over our impending new status as an oil economy and are sowing hopelessness in our future are also out of touch with the hitherto barefooted man and woman who want and deserve the better life our country is stable and peaceful and president david granger stands tall as a defender of the rule of law and is eminently re electable 1
a s far as interest rates are concerned the new boss of the european central bank ecb christine lagarde seems largely in agreement with mario draghi her predecessor where she seems to differ is in wanting the bank to be greener on december 2nd she told european parliamentarians that a planned review of its monetary policy strategy should take in the impact of climate change other central bankers too are going green in recent months ratesetters from sydney to san francisco have opined on the impact of climate change on economic and financial stability the subject has long preoccupied mark carney the governor of the bank of england who is soon to become the un s climate envoy listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element so far central banks have focused on the impact of climate risk on the financial system but activists argue that just as central bankers saved the global economy during the financial crisis so too must they tackle the next emergency by shifting capital away from polluters and towards greener uses europe s technocrats seem willing to consider the idea others caution that it should be a job for politicians instead in 2015 mr carney set out the channels through which climate change could threaten financial stability financial firms are exposed to physical risks floods for instance lead to big insurance payouts and sink the value of banks mortgage books then there is transition risk new government policies such as a carbon price could see investors dump the assets of polluting companies share prices could collapse and defaults on bank loans rise polluters also risk climate related litigation exxon an oil company was accused of misleading investors over the costs of climate change though on december 10th a court in new york found it not guilty so it is important to understand companies exposures to climate risk in 2015 central banks from the g 20 group of large economies set up a task force to encourage disclosure to date these suggest that exposures are significant but not daunting as of june nearly half of the world s largest 500 companies by market capitalisation had reported exposures much of which are expected to be realised within the next five years those added up to 1trn or 6 of the firms total market value some supervisors have started including climate risk in their assessments of banks and insurers the bank of england requires banks to have a plan for dealing with such risks the network for greening the financial system ngfs a group of 51 central banks and supervisors collates guidelines for regulators and disseminates scenarios to help analyse potential losses to the financial system the dutch central bank was the first to conduct a stress test along these lines in 2018 finding the effects of climate risk to be sizeable but also manageable dutch banks exposed mostly through their loans to companies stood to lose up to 3 of their assets insurers and pension funds exposed through holdings of corporate bonds and equities could make losses of around 10 the people s bank of china pb o c helped set up the ngfs and has led efforts to firm up the definition of a green bond malaysia s central bank is working on a similar taxonomy with the world bank and in september hosted a powwow on climate change but one big emitter has been relatively reticent although america accounts for 15 of the world s emissions its federal reserve is not part of the ngfs no doubt reflecting a lack of political interest even the fed though is talking about how climate change might eventually affect the economy in november lael brainard a member of its board of governors said climate related disruption could affect productivity and long term economic growth with consequences for interest rates central bankers in commodity producing countries such as norway and australia note that a shift from polluters would alter the structure of their economies a far more controversial question though is whether central bankers should seek to change polluters behaviour as part of its asset purchase scheme the ecb holds 183bn 203bn of corporate bonds its purchases are broadly representative of the market energy and utility firms which are sizeable issuers of corporate bonds account for roughly a third of the ecb s corporate bond holdings on november 27th former central bank officials and activists pressed ms lagarde to stop buying dirty assets or accepting them as collateral when it lends to banks she plans to study the idea supporters argue that such steps would help correct investors failure to price polluters riskiness in full they would not necessarily conflict with the day job of central banks says patrick honohan a former head of ireland s central bank many are charged first with ensuring price stability and second with supporting wider government policy but critics are unconvinced in october jens weidmann the head of germany s bundesbank worried that a climate objective could compromise ratesetters commitment to stable inflation greening asset purchases would mean deciding how much polluters should be penalised a job for elected politicians not technocrats says tony yates an economist formerly at the bank of england notably the pb o c accepts green bonds as collateral and gives banks green assets favourable regulatory treatment but central banks in places where the government holds less sway may be loth to follow its lead as its economic and financial effects become clearer climate change is certain to loom larger in central banks thinking what they do about it will depend on their willingness to tread on political turf sign up to our new fortnightly climate change newsletter here

a reeducation on wind energy rbf follow published in the startup 12 min read dec 13 2019 1 listen share i published the article below in the huffington post in 2016 a couple of years ago i tried to forward it to an interested friend only to discover it had been removed all of my other editorials remained in place i am empirically critical of wind energy bringing to light multiple shortcomings of a glorified industry thought part of a holy grail leading to a carbon free emissions world i can only deduce intellectual discrimination as to why huff post axed my opinions wind energy currently has about 8 percent of us generating capacity yet only provides around 2 5 percent of energy consumption only winds massive environmental degradation exceeds its inefficiency as an energy source the article has been updated to reflect more current facts and statistics the dirty part of green energy the apparent ubiquitous proliferation of hillsides stuffed with majestic 400 foot wind turbine blades seemingly innocently whirling to churn out kilowatt after kilowatt of sacrosanct green energy are now embedded as quaint americana just gaze at these mammoths and breathe deep the hardy pristine air visualize shrinking carbon footprints and global warming being in the past tense unfortunately when we unfold the curtains the naked wizard behind the propaganda exposes things significantly less wholesome even inconvenient truths as al gore might say let s get to it i spent time studying power industry arcana to convert things like kilowatts to megawatts to btu s to the energy output of an mcf of natural gas an mcf one thousand cubic feet is the standard unit to quote this commodity one mcf trades as of december 11 trades at about 2 25 seeking to understand analogous energy outputs i compared a natural gas well making 1 mmcf one million cubic feet per day versus a 1 5 mw megawatt wind turbine the results were astonishing it requires 25 yes twenty five 1 5 mw wind turbines to produce the energy of one natural gas well that produces 1 mmcf per day i did my first calculations looking at the number of kwh kilowatt hours that each generated in one year so sure my arithmetic skills had atrophied i re ran my numbers using a different metric looking at how many btu s british thermal units each source yielded in one year the results were the same less than one half of one percent differential still wobbly and out of my field of expertise i contacted senior fellow at the manhattan institute and wind energy expert mr robert bryce he does his figures using boe d barrel of oil equivalent day nearly identical to mine his numbers yielded the gas well spewing out 24 6 times the energy of the wind turbine all calculations are shown below one of the key assumptions in estimating turbine output is in the trade jargon capacity factor how often does the turbine spin what percent of the time is the wind blowing hard enough to feed energy into the transmission lines originally i used a 25 percent capacity which is a figure assumed by national wind watch that number in my formulas had gas wells making 33 times the energy of a single turbine mr bryce insisted that a 33 percent capacity was a more industry standard so that was the number used to arrive at the 25 to 1 ratio with natural gas prices low even in the shale revolution energy firms are cutting back on capital expenditures for gas wells that said it would take a whole lot more production than 1 mmcf d to justify committing capital to drill a new well as an exercise i picked a random county in the prolific marcellus shale region to see what top gas wells were producing as of august 2019 the top 10 gas wells in washington county pa were each averaging production over 20 mmcf d some had been online for more than a year the translation means it would take over 5 000 1 5 mw wind turbines to match the energy output of just these ten wells in fairness many of the new generations of turbines are rated at 3 to 4 mw and higher of potential output though many thousands of existing older ones are a lot less than 1 mw ge has a prototype for an offshore 12 mw turbine land construction and pollution the clean energy advocacy group national renewable energy laboratory estimates 10 mw of wind energy output requires one square mile 640 acres of land so to mimic the energy output of the 10 marcellus above mentioned gas wells would require the development of 750 square miles 432 000 acres of virgin land that s lots of destruction of mountain ridges open plains not to mention the clearing for roads and dynamiting necessary for the turbine platform site construction wind turbines are enormous the ge 1 5 mw model stands 328 feet tall with a total weight of 164 tons the danish 1 8 mw turbine reaches 410 feet tipping the scales at 267 tons the 2 mw spanish gamesa g87 weighs 334 tons and measures 399 feet imagine building roads to accommodate trucking in 140 foot blades a 71 ton tower or a 56 ton nacelle a lot of nature must be obliterated with very questionable returns the platforms made to anchor the turbine tower require more than one thousand tons of concrete and steel rebar and depending on the land contour are 6 to 30 feet deep the heavier and larger ge 4 8 mw turbine may require up to two thousand tons of concrete the manufacture of each one ton of cement emits 900 kg kilograms of co2 into the atmosphere that equates to uncountable millions of tons of carbon dioxide emissions attributable to just the concrete base consider now the rare earth elements necessary to construct the generator for the turbine each mw requires an estimated 2 000 pounds of rare earth elements the devastating environmental aftermath of mining and processing these metals go unmentioned by the wind industry in particular and the environmental lobby in general for a mid sized 100 mw wind project waste from rare earths will generate 20 000 square meters of destroyed vegetation 2 million pounds of co2 6 million cubic meters of toxic air pollution 29 million gallons of poisoned water 600 million pounds of highly contaminated tailing sands and 280 000 pounds of radioactive waste killing of innocents while the turbines turn innocent flyers get churned estimates vary widely but millions of birds are decimated for the grail of going green the smallwood study wildlife society bulletin concluded in 2013 on a 2012 installed base of 51 6 thousand mw of installed wind capacity 888 000 bats and 573 000 birds gave their lives through the second quarter of 2019 wind energy in place approached 97 thousand mw you can extrapolate and do the math of the 573 000 birds an estimated 83 000 were raptors or birds of prey besides owls red tailed hawks and kestrels this includes both bald and golden eagles in dr smallwood s 2004 survey at northern california s altamont pass wind facility he determined the golden eagle ge bird kill at 116 annually putting the total ge carnage over 3 000 in the 26 years of operations at only 576 mw of energy output altamont represents well less than one percent of america s total wind output once again with an overall golden eagle population of only around 100 000 make your statistical guess to what the yearly reduction of our eagle populations is for more perspective the altamont pass wind farm has 4 930 inefficient antique turbines annually making only 125 mw of energy with a 576 mw maximum capacity this translates to a paltry 21 7 of potential it takes only two of the marcellus above mentioned gas wells to churn out significantly more energy than the total of these nearly 5 000 antediluvian killing machines that each year systematically wipe out thousands of other birds besides the cherished and other than wind legally protected eagles i have driven by these hillsides 60 miles or so due east of san francisco and they are a pox on the otherwise beautiful natural landscape as legal guardians of our wildlife the u s fish and wildlife department usfwd has fiduciary responsibilities transcending any other government agency constant turmoil surrounds the usfwd and it s management of eagle take permits one improvement centers around extending eagle kill permits for wind farm developers from 5 years to 30 years ostensibly a 30 year longevity license to murder facilitates project finance lawsuits led by the american bird conservancy are flying to prevent these government improvements if only the eagles knew the nefarious machinations of their protectors if the 30 year permits are granted robert bryce puts the bald eagle turbine exterminations as high as 4 200 per year on an estimated population of only 72 434 see here for some of the sanctioned murder proposals euphemistically referred by the usfwd as eagle management see here and here for other american bird conservancy protection efforts evasion or rather excused evasion of the eagle protection act and the migratory bird treaty act is what is at issue hundreds of oil and gas industry prosecutions for running stop signs versus zero for genocide up to a year in the slammer plus potential six figure fines for everyone but the wind business for the first violation and it gets worse from there so as measurable percentages of the bald eagle and golden eagle populations are without ceremony prosecution annually slaughtered by turbine blades i am compelled to bring attention to the egregious 2011 holocaust in bakken oil fields of north dakota a total of 6 ducks yes that s correct 6 and one says phoebe unexpectedly perished as they navigated themselves into open oil waste pits the justice department was swift in their diligence to hand down criminal indictments against evil doers continental resources newfield production and brigham oil gas there are some very credible sources that put overall turbine bird kills exponentially higher in 2012 the spanish ornithological society seo birdlife reviewed actual carcass counts from 136 monitoring studies they concluded that spain s 18 000 wind turbines are killing 6 18 million birds and bats yearly a german and swedish study using similar methodologies extrapolated 39 000 u s wind turbines would end the lives of 13 39 million birds and bats every year the wanton abetment of the slaughter of our national emblem is pardoned to placate chief wind puppeteers a far more politically correct solution would be to sacrifice the wicked souls culpable of the sedition of global warming denial base load peak load intermittency and transmission and the ptc power grids have the unenviable task of being tasked with providing uninterrupted electricity to businesses and households 24 7 and 365 days a year base loads are met by

plants cause efficiency losses not only as heat rates degrade but also as more fossil fuels are burned in multiple startups the wind often blows at inconvenient intervals tanton again as wind energy is dumped un used onto transmission lines during late night low demand periods taxpayers still pay developers the 2 3 cent production tax credit ptc so every kilowatt hour of power produced by the wind receives the 2 3 cent ptc regardless of whether that power was dumped at two a m and went unused this subsidy cost taxpayers 2 billion in 2013 and there are more than double the megawatts of wind today mr tanton again making matters worse the best wind locations are long since developed meaning longer transmission runs lower capacities and more fuel burned for gas turbine startups to balance even more volatile wind output transmission lines or systems are often constructed for a specific wind installation it may be many hundreds of miles from the nearest power station hook up while the eia puts average power losses for all lines at 5 for the ten years ending 2014 according to mr tanton because of much larger average transmission distances and other factors in the west at least a 10 power loss is a good rule of thumb i might add though that the big boondoggle occurs with the line construction codes require these systems are built assuming 100 of production capacity when average output trends 30 or so raising the cost per kilowatt hour delivered this is many millions more wasted dollars the greatest irony comes from the bentek analysis that concludes co2 savings through wind power are either so minimal as to be irrelevant or too expensive to be practical in other words the intermittency of wind causes the repeated starts and stops of the backup reliable coal and gas fired systems the surplus co2 emitted during these necessary redundancies often offsets all of the co2 savings of wind the entire argument for wind dissolves on this one point alone sierra club against wind huh the choice between birds and wind now becomes binary and thus mutually exclusive that wind industry and the sierra club could be on opposing sides are oxymoron enough they ve been having sex together for so long the sense of mutual betrayal must be unbearable but to protect the birds the sierra club along with the center for biological diversity and defenders of wildlife unsuccessfully sued in kerns county ca to block two proposed wind projects north sky river and jawbone beam yourself 3 000 miles to upstate new york in erie orleans and niagra counties their opposition focuses on the 200 mw lighthouse project which would encumber 20 000 acres abutting and polluting the lake ontario shoreline other townships in new york state have banned or are in the process of protesting new wind projects as an aside the center for biological diversity has filed and settled various lawsuits against altamont pass the inherent schism comes from perverse incentives both to expand wind energy and utility mandates to purchase it therefore these electricity providers are lined up to procure wind energy besides the ptc there is another equally degenerate acronym called itc or investment tax credit this government giveaway rebates 30 of the cost of wind project construction in the form of a dollar for dollar tax credit not a deduction but a full credit given the 2 3 cent ptc the 30 itc and utility quotas to meet date certain carbon levels the leading impediment to wind development isn t financing but project approval permits landowners and townships across america are taking harder looks at allowing not only behemoth landscape disturbing turbines but also ghastly transmission lines courts are clogged more and more with eminent domain cases with many plaintiff ranchers and farmers fighting to prevent swaths of their lands seized by fiat for access roads and transmission lines that often run hundreds of miles the itc began being phased out to 80 in 2017 60 in 2018 and 40 in 2019 politicians currently are trying to get the itc fully reinstated maybe there is a place for wind energy regimes under the right circumstances but wind power technology has improved greatly but here too no 10 fold gains are left the physics boundary for a wind turbine the betz limit is a maximum capture of 60 of kinetic energy in moving air commercial turbines today exceed 40 read manhattan institute s mark mills brilliant summary on the physical limits of wind solar and battery technologies data proving the impossibility that these technologies can ever come close to meeting our energy needs ad hoc installations driven by the financial inducements of the investment tax credit and the generous production tax credit is prodigal public policy despite my compendium of inefficiencies taxpayer subsidies and sanctioned lawlessness as of the end of september 2019 wind energy exceeded 100 000 mw 100 gigawatts if there s a better example than the wind industry of regulatory capture and

the high household debt load is the most important risk facing the financial system bank of canada governor poloz another central banker that bemoans the effects of this handiwork canadian households rated near the top of the most indebted in the world accomplished something awe inspiring they got even more indebted and their leverage rose to a new record according to data released today by statistics canada the portion of their disposable income total incomes from all sources minus taxes that canadian households spent on making principal and interest payments including on mortgage debts and non mortgage debts such as credit card balances reached a new record of 14 96 in the third quarter this record beat the prior record of 2007 and this happened despite still ultra low interest rates mortgage debt was the driver behind this new record as the portion of disposable income that canadians spent to make interest and principal payments on their mortgages rose to 6 74 the highest ever but these are aggregate numbers and for some individual households the burden is a lot higher based on data from the 2016 census 67 8 of canadian households own their home and the ratio has been dropping the remaining households rent and they do not have a mortgage and a portion of those who own a home do not have a mortgage either because they d already paid it off and another portion of homeowners only carries a relatively small amount of mortgage debt but among the remaining homeowners particularly those who bought in recent years the burden of their mortgage is heavy and it s this portion that everyone is worrying about not the large number of other canadian households in the us it was this portion that triggered the mortgage crisis not the renters and not the one third of homeowners who d already paid off their mortgages and not those homeowners who d paid down their mortgages significantly non mortgage debt such as credit card balances and personal loans also increased but did not take out the previous high in the third quarter debt service on non mortgage debts reached 8 23 of disposable income the highest since q3 2008 this chart shows the two ratios separately to compare the household debt burden on the economy between canada and the us we can look at household debt to nominal gdp measures each in their own currencies which eliminates exchange rate fluctuations and inflation issues americans were forced to deleverage during the mortgage bust and housing bust and have never re leveraged to the full extent particularly with mortgage debt and credit card debts which are barely higher than they were at the peak in 2007 but over those 12 years the economy had grown and the population has grown and the ratio of mortgage debt and credit card debt to gdp has declined sharply the exception are student loans which have totally blown out and auto loans which have also increased faster than gdp canadian households in aggregate never really experienced the full effects of the financial crisis in the housing market and they weren t forced to deleverage and there was no lesson to be learned and they have gone hog wild on debt to fund their housing bubbles the high household debt load is the most important risk facing the financial system bank of canada governor stephen polozpoloz said in a speech on thursday whereupon he was challenged by bnn bloomberg s andrew bell during the press conference but aren t you the man who is to blame for that bell asked you kept those interest rates so low all those years you re the main author of that bubble aren t you we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us rather than just agreeing with the obvious poloz said this a lot of things may have contributed to it and certainly i would say keeping interest rates low as many countries have had to do for over 10 years now if we go back to 2008 9 10 we had a lot of fiscal action at the same time as monetary stimulus and then globally we saw enough of a recovery at that time in 2010 that governments decided ok we got things back on track so we can consolidate on the fiscal side monetary policy makers figured we d be coming out of it too but then the economy faltered again and we had the period that we call serial disappointment and it s in that phase that monetary policy kind of got stuck in this very stimulative place offsetting headwinds that are hard to really quantify by conventional analysis but they re obviously there even though the economy is at full employment more or less and inflation is on target we re there but at really low interest rates from a historical standpoint so those low interest rates are still stimulating against some contrary force the fact inflation is on target suggests that the bank of canada has done its job now if there are side effects one of them you mentioned well those are secondary effects they re not our prime mission our prime mission is to stabilize the economy and keep inflation on target and we succeeded with that and bnn bloomberg s bell asked are you worried that your legacy could be seen as leaving canadians with a bunch of unsustainable debt this time poloz was more direct deny deny deny because those were only side effects no i don t see this household debt as unsustainable that s an important distinction i see it as a vulnerability if a nasty shock came along and unemployment in canada rose significantly if that nasty shock came along it would be magnified by the pile of household debt so we would have a bigger and probably more prolonged recession than we would if the debt was not there but of course even in the most extreme stress tests we can bring to the picture that combine the worst of 1981 with the worst of 2008 etc with falling house prices rising unemployment and a big recession our financial system remains very resilient through those experiments now that doesn t say that there wouldn t be people suffering from those recessions of course with high unemployment possibly having to default on mortgages i m not dismissing that that matters a great deal to me to its credit the bank of canada under poloz has raised rates starting in 2017 from 0 5 to currently 1 75 to put a lid on the rampant housing bubbles in greater toronto and the vancouver metro and it has never dipped into the negative interest rate absurdity that has broken out in europe and japan and it has worked with other regulators to put macroprudential measures in place that would tamp down on the ballooning household debt bubble that was feeding the housing bubbles but these measures came years too late and what s left now are the questions and worries over just how sustainable this household debt bubble really is
michael hicks i released my 2020 economist forecast last week projecting the u s economy to slow significantly next year the model i use projects that annualized growth rates will slip from 1 9 percent in the first quarter of 2020 down to 1 7 percent by the year s end here in indiana my forecasting model has growth slowing to 1 6 percent in the first quarter and to 1 4 percent by the year s end this is agonizingly slow economic growth like most of the midwest indiana s economy slowed through 2019 and is almost certain to end the year with fewer jobs than we had last january this is not a nationwide recession though it seems likely indiana will continue to shed jobs through at least the summer of 2020 my forecast is wrong of course as all forecasts inevitably are however in reviewing the direction of error i find most of my mistakes are in the optimistic range i certainly hope that changes but right now little evidence suggests otherwise in thinking about our current economy it is important to discuss the current policy environment the federal reserve is busily engaged in a form of quantitative easing to the tune of close to 400 billion interest rates are near historical lows and our federal deficit topped 1 1 trillion last year more pointedly the farm bailout is now much larger than the auto bailout in the summer of 2009 taken altogether it is a simple fact that our federal government is currently engaged in deeper economic stimulus than we saw in the first year of the obama presidency that was in the midst of the darkest days of the great recession whatever good we can note about our recent economic performance has to be calibrated against those facts there is a moral lesson here for many hoosiers if you were outraged by the obama s administration s stimulus and bailouts and are sympathetic to the worries of the tea party in 2009 you face a clear choice today you must be either much more livid or have abandoned any appearance of personal integrity on these matters it is worse than run of the mill intellectual dishonesty to compare unfavorably the democrats and president obama s bailouts of 2009 with the republicans and president trump today the 2009 stimulus and bailouts occurred in the midst of the deepest economic crisis since the 1930s today s vast stimulus and bailout occurs at the tail end of the longest economic expansion in 175 years the current fiscal environment is unsupportable more from michael hicks the recovery has not been kind to indiana in short the 2019 and 2020 economies are sizing up to be the worst non recession years in post world war ii history they are going to be worse for manufacturing intensive states right now indiana wisconsin michigan ohio and illinois have fewer factory jobs than we started the year with some of this is doubtless due to a return to trend of declining manufacturing employment but the trade war is most responsible for this downturn but there is also good news wage growth which has been very sluggish through the recovery has been strong and growing for well over a year the unemployment rate is well beneath the level most economists thought would cause rapid inflation yet there is no evidence of inflationary pressures jobs across the nation are abundant perhaps not great jobs but jobs nonetheless the strength of demand for workers spills over into other measures of labor market health the broadest measures of unemployment which includes the underemployed and those who work sporadically is down year over year the size of the labor force is growing up 1 6 million potential workers since 2018 moreover the employment to population ratio has nearly recovered to the peak of the early 2000s without accounting for baby boomer retirements these strong labor markets mean that consumers are still buying consumer spending doesn t cause economic growth but it stabilizes an economy by giving confidence to businesses and investors even with a clear economic slowdown people are buying homes filling them with furniture buying consumer electronics and otherwise translating the fruits of their labor into consumption for 2020 the job losses in manufacturing simply won t be enough to push our economy into a recession but in a world where fiscal and monetary stimuli are more akin to the great depression than a long recovery and all the global ills surround an unpredictable and highly idiosyncratic trade war forecasting certainty is hard to come by michael hicks is the george and frances ball distinguished professor of economics and the director of the center for business and economic research at ball state university
while many a news outlet regularly reports when jeff bezos and bill gates flip flop as to who is the richest person in the world with bernard arnault and warren buffet nipping at their heals as we previously noted in our article on the richest people in history bezos and gates combined wealth barely matches that of the known fortune of former libyan dictator muammar gaddafi who ruled over that oil rich country for over three decades before being ousted and then killed in 2011 so how wealthy was gaddafi in the years since his death so far nearly 200 billion dollars have been found in secret accounts real estate holdings and other investments directly belonging to him no matter whether he acquired it ethically or not assets are assets and gaddafi had the most of any known person so far this century by a huge margin another individual who has more or less ruled a petroleum rich nation for about two decades now is likewise rumored to secretly have a net worth in excess of 200 billion we are of course talking about vladimir putin but is putin actually the richest person in the world or are these just rumors to begin with as you might imagine being born in the soviet union in 1952 putin didn t exactly start out life in the lap of luxury in a bit of 1950s era role reversal his father was a cook and his mother a factory worker putin himself would grow up to join the kgb in 1975 working a variety of positions with that institution over the years while you might envision hollywood spy type scenarios were his daily life in fact according to journalist and biographer masha gessen putin and his colleagues were reduced mainly to collecting press clippings thus contributing to the mountains of useless information produced by the kgb the first rumor that putin was using a government position to stash away quite a lot of money for his own personal gain came in the early 1990s when he in his then position as head of the committee for external relations at the mayor s office in st petersburg allegedly helped broker a 93 million deal to acquire various food supplies for the city in a nutshell various companies were granted permits that would allow them to supply a huge amount of materials to foreign entities and in exchange would be given an equivalent value back in foodstuffs to then be used within the famished city the thing was as far as anyone can tell while the companies did send out the materials no foodstuffs came back in return the matter was ultimately investigated by one marina salye at the behest of the city council with salye in turn claiming putin s signature could be found authorizing the deals she states the raw materials were shipped abroad but the food didn t materialise there s 100 proof that in this putin was to blame as a result in 1992 when there was no food at all the city was left with nothing the evidence i have is as solid as it gets putin well his committee made bartering contacts to get food for the city he issued licenses and commodities wood metal cotton heating oil and oil flew out of the country that said while she states putin was to blame and at least according to her she had definitive proof she did not find any evidence that putin had received anything in return for the apparently botched deals as for putin he claimed the companies that had been given the export permits in the deal were to blame for foodstuffs not coming back as they were supposed to have implying that putin had no knowledge the deals wouldn t be completed as originally brokered when he issued the licenses the city council would move forward with further investigation but ultimately mayor anatoly sobchak put a stop to it and the matter was dropped while you ll read in many outlets reporting this story that salye would die of so called natural causes mere weeks after she made these accusations and the investigation was killed in truth she would go on to help found the free democratic party of russia and more or less continually rail against putin to anyone in the media and public who would listen until eventually giving up in 2000 after the election and moving to the countryside there she lived until her death at the age of 77 in 2012 though she did give a handful of interviews during that span still unabashedly anti putin as for putin from that 1992 political position he worked his way up to becoming one of a trio of deputy prime ministers and was known to be boris yeltsin s preferred successor despite before this being a relative unknown among the wider public ultimately he did indeed become president in 2000 after winning the majority vote once elected putin like his predecessor reported his finances and holdings publicly including his salary and exact amount in his many bank accounts he has continued to do so since the result over the years while his salary has changed regularly from year to year he has made approximately 100k 190k annually in that span for example in 2018 reporting an income of 135k today between his wife s and his own accounts the couple seem to have a little over a half a million in cash in various bank accounts though why he isn t investing this is rather curious given his apparent lack of any other investments and almost complete lack of actually needing any cash for his day to day life given the government foots the bill for most everything of this putin states honestly speaking i don t even know what my salary is they deliver it to me i take it put it my bank account and don t even count it as for his other assets he also owns a studio sized apartment in saint petersburg a slightly larger apartment in moscow owns a small garage a couple cars a small plot of land outside of moscow and otherwise has various minor assets of no great worth of course over the years people can t help but notice that putin has a collection of watches he wears very publicly whose purchase price combined is around that of his reported entire net worth ringing in at about 400 000 700 000 if various reports are to be believed for reference the highest valued watch he has been spotted wearing costs around 140 000 a patek philippe perpetual calendar watch on top of that the clothing he can often be seen wearing is likewise extremely expensive such as his 6000 tailored suits from outlets like kiton and brioni not just expensive suits in one photo of him working out putin can be seen wearing sweatpants that cost over 1 400 a pair apparently made from silk cashmere and the tears of impoverished children along with a similarly priced top on top of that among other mansions he is long rumored to own an estate known as putin s palace near praskoveevka widely reported to be worth 1 billion by media outlets however this was actually sold in 2011 to one alexander ponomarenko a former associate of putin s for somewhere around 350 million note the exact amount has not been publicly disclosed but ponomarenko has indicated it s in the ballpark of that widely reported figure ponomarenko purchased the estate from a group led by businessman nikolai shamalov ponomarenko claims he decided to buy the company behind the estate project and thus the mansion as it was a steal of a deal owing to the project being stalled from lack of funds to complete the estate and the business group wanting to cut their losses on it rather than complete it that said russian businessman sergei kolesnikov who is exiled from russia claims the palace was built specifically for putin s use he claims putin was able to afford its construction in part thanks to a gift given him by the aforementioned nikolai shamalov in the form of 94 of the shares in a company called lirus holding among other personal knowledge of the development of the palace kolesnikov claims shamalov himself told him this and to quote him i have no reason not to believe him however no documents concerning any ownership connected to the project seem to indicate putin or any holdings of putin s ever were directly involved with this estate that said some contract documents concerning its construction allegedly have the signature of one vladimir kozhin one of putin s inner circle of confidants of course this still doesn t definitively indicate whether putin actually owned the palace or even was behind its building at all simply allegedly someone he is close to was involved in some capacity and later someone else he is close to bought it a bit of a theme for a lot of these rumors putin himself denies he had anything to do with the palace being built nevertheless putin allegedly frequents the palace and federal protective service guards have been seen at the mansion along with locals reporting seeing putin in the area regularly of course among the extremely wealthy with such mansions it s not uncommon at all to allow friends to guest in one s estates whenever they please so putin would not have to actually own the thing to stay there nor would it be a big ask to do so more or less par for the course among the exorbitantly wealthy that said on top of all this estate putin has been connected to causing to have had built or secretly owning several other mansions yachts planes etc whether he actually owns any of these or like putin s palace seemingly is just using them when he pleases his flashing of extreme wealth in the case of his watches and other such items along with an awful lot of not implausible allegations of widespread corruption within his government connected to him has led to the belief that he has boatloads of money secretly stashed away in accounts throughout the world others speculate putin is simply using the government coffers to finance all these extravagances for many items this would not actually be that uncommon for a major world leader if a lot more excessive than most for example the replacement air force one planes the u s president will soon have at his disposal has a budget of over 3 billion the u s president also gets a pretty posh mansion the white house and vacations spots to go to at their leisure with the tax payer footing the bill for quite a lot of such perks with few batting an eye at this but of course the u s government isn t funding 140 000 watches for the president though bullet proof tailored suits occasionally worn by the president are presumably paid for by the u s taxpayer for more on this incredible thin bullet proof fabric go see our article how many times can you shoot through a bulletproof vest before it stops working to attempt to clarify these items requests have been made to the russian government asking if for example putin s watches are actually his or property of the state that he is just wearing but no answer to this question has been given that we could find whatever the case yet others claim putin is simply enriching many people around him and it is they who are then happy to provide putin with anything and everything his judo master heart can desire yet others claim it is all three putin is enriching himself through shady means and using government funds and people he is helping make wealthy to get whatever he wants while he s in office but the question of the hour is not whether putin s net worth is more than he is letting on that is very apparently true by his watch collection alone whether he purchased them or they were gifted the question of the hour is whether he is secretly the richest person in the world with a net worth in excess of 200 billion as so many claim so what does the man himself say about all these rumors i am the wealthiest man not just in europe but in the whole world case closed right he admitted it well in truth he wasn t finished talking he goes on i collect emotions i am wealthy in that the people of russia have twice entrusted me with the leadership of a great nation such as russia i believe that is my greatest wealth of course whether he collects emotions or not doesn t inherently negate the first part of that statement simply that he considers that a greater wealth than whatever he has possession wise argue amongst yourselves whether this was putin cleverly admitting to being the wealthiest person in the world while making it seem like he was saying he wasn t and also simultaneously admitting he s a lizard person given a hallmark of these creatures is apparently feeding on human emotions for a more direct answer to the question about the rumors of his extreme wealth he clarifies it s just chitchat nonsense nothing to discuss they picked it out of their noses and smeared it on their pieces of paper the press and information office of the president of the russian federation s also asserts of these rumors this information has no substance as you may know the declarations of mr putin s income and property are published annually we recommend you to use only reliable sources henceforward and not to believe fake news in 2018 naturally nobody seems satisfied with these assertions given his apparent and frequent flashing of wealth far beyond what anyone with his salary should be able to afford so what do others who might know a little more say first we have political analyst and noted critic of putin stanislav belkovsky who claimed to the bureau of investigative journalism in 2012 that putin had net worth of approximately 70 billion though how he came up with this figure isn t exactly definitive nor inspiring confidence in his hard knowledge here in his own words the figure of 40 billion emerged in 2007 that figure could now have changed i believe at the level of 60 70 billion maximum we cannot know i suspect there are some businesses i know nothing about mildly more concrete at least in terms of given something more specific he also claims much of this wealth is because of putin s alleged 4 5 stake in gazprom 37 stake in surgutneftegas and allegedly 50 ownership of gunvor how he knows this however isn t fully clear belkovsky simply states he got this information through sources he has within the companies it s also noted that for a time gunvor was co owned by a friend of putin s billionaire gennady timchenko so what do the three companies say for whatever it s worth corporate affairs director of the swiss based gunvor group seth thomas pietras states president putin has never had any interest in investment in or involvement with gunvor group either directly or indirectly mr belkovsky s claims are based on absolutely nothing and are fundamentally ridiculous and the u s government despite its statement has never sanctioned gunvor in any capacity nor has it provided any evidence of its own moving on to surgutneftegas they likewise deny putin owns any shares gazprom which is majority owned by the russian government itself with the rest of the stock publicly traded likewise shows no records of putin owning any shares belkovsky counters these denials by the companies and lack of records stating putin has a rather elaborate network of off shore companies and funds that own the shares which all ultimately mask that he himself actually owns or at least controls them moving on to the ceo of hermitage capital management bill browder he is the one that seems to have started the widespread rumor that putin s personal wealth is in excess of 200 billion stating before a senate judiciary committee i believe he is worth 200 billion the purpose of the putin regime has been to commit terrible crimes in order to get that money he keeps his money in the west and all of his money in the west is potentially exposed to asset freezes and confiscation therefore he has a significant and very personal interest in finding a way to get rid of the magnitsky sanctions on this latter note one of browder s former associates russian lawyer sergei magnitsky was investigating corruption within the russian government and allegedly found evidence of various russian officials taking part in a near quarter of a billion dollar tax fraud scheme magnitsky himself was then arrested for allegedly being the mastermind behind the tax fraud and died while in jail before his trial at the partial encouragement of browder the u s then passed the magnitsky act in 2009 in an oversimplified nutshell this allows the u s government to sanction various individuals thought to be human rights offenders ban them from entering the u s and more importantly freeze their assets where the government is able the bill was essentially meant to allow the government to legally hold somewhat accountable those thought to have been involved in magnitsky s death as for hard data however browder offers little next up noted economist anders aslund author of the book russia s crony capitalism the path from market economy to kleptocracy states i would estimate that putin is worth around 100 160 billion we can see that putin and his friends have taken 10 15 billion from gazprom every year since 2004 that s just gazprom there are large numbers of transactions being made what s much more difficult is to see where the money goes it s typically cyprus cayman islands british virgin islands and willmington delaware as to how he came up with these figures he states my assessment is that since putin s circle got its looting fully organized around 2006 they have extracted 15 25 billion a year reaching a total of 195 325 billion a large share of the russian private offshore wealth presuming that half of this wealth belongs to putin his net wealth would amount to 100 160 billion naturally putin and his cronies cannot enjoy their wealth it is all about power if they are not the wealthiest they fear they will lose power why he assumes putin would get half of these alleged amounts instead of some other percentage isn t fully clear on that note like so many before nobody seems to be able to actually offer hard evidence that putin has any money stashed away anywhere not publicly known which when talking sums of allegedly 200 billion is a pretty neat trick for someone who has been so highly scrutinized including by the u s senate who presumably if they wanted could just ask the cia or other entities good at collecting such data to look into it given instead they are asking the likes of browder it has been presumed and widely claimed that the cia and other such government entities have no definitive intelligence on this either from this lack of a paper trail directly linking money or assets to putin yet his clearly lavish lifestyle indicating he does indeed have access to an awful lot of money this has led many to conclude that putin himself doesn t actually officially own most or all of the wealth attributed to him but rather he is leveraging his position and connections to enrich those close to him who in their gratitude are then more than happy to provide putin with any money or items he wants from access to mansion to yachts to sweatpants that keep his judo jubblies ultra comfortable when working out as alleged evidence for this we turn to 11 5 million documents from the panama mossack fonseca law firm made public in 2016 dealing in off shore holdings by over 200 000 entities while putin himself is not listed in any of them the documents do reveal three close associates of putin s among those having off shore holdings partially managed by the law firm with a combined amount of around 2 billion between the trio despite not owning these assets there are many claims by various individuals that putin uses some of these like his personal bank account most notably the holdings of a man claimed by many in the media as putin s best friend famed russian musician and conductor sergei roldugin not just a friend roldugin is also the godfather to one of putin s children and was the man who introduced putin to putin s wife as for where roldugin supposedly got his extreme wealth beyond his noted music career starting in the 1990s roldugin began investing in various oil and other business entities to great success beyond all of this in 2019 roldugin also was accused of being involved in a massive multi billion dollar money laundering scheme in conjunction with sberbank cib which allegedly profited him greatly that said for those using these records as proof of putin having money elsewhere via his associates it should be again noted these are the records of well over 200 000 entities throughout the world and the vast majority who are using the firm are doing so completely legitimately including actor jackie chan who reportedly had six perfectly above board off shore companies the law firm helped manage various facets of so that three among putin s numerous friends who are exorbitantly wealthy should be included isn t necessarily proof of anything other than they wanted to have some assets outside of russia which isn t uncommon among the wealthy in russia as some formerly close to putin who have had their assets stripped and forced to flee the country demonstrate having some off short holdings is probably a good security blanket of sorts just in case on this note political scientist professor and author of putin s kleptocracy karen dawisha stated before her death from lung cancer in 2018 why is it that 150 billion left the country last year because they believe that their wealth can only be secured in the long term outside their own country coming back to the posed question of whether putin is secretly the richest person in the world whether these funds are being held for him or not this is still not putin s money not just technically but we re guessing regardless of the amount of good will putin has built up with these various businessmen and women should he no longer be in power they might quickly find themselves less than willing to continue to support his lifestyle if that is what has been happening as is widely believed and some speculate he might even find himself in a rather unsafe circumstance in that case for example one time billionaire and the man formerly known as putin s banker but now exiled from russia sergei pugachev says everything that belongs to the territory of the russian federation putin considers to be his everything gazprom rosneft private companies any attempt to calculate it won t succeed he s the richest person in the world until he leaves power as for leaving power he goes on that putin chose not to leave office after his first term and beyond not because of a desire for continued power but rather because he feared for his own safety should he no longer be in that position even today pugachev claims i don t see any guarantees for him putin doesn t see them either which is why he finds it unlikely that putin will ever willingly leave office though it should be noted that putin himself has stated he will not be running for president at the end of his current term in 2024 also for whatever it s worth pugachev despite having billions stripped from himself by the russian government being currently in fear for his life and in exile states in his opinion putin himself is not evil nor did putin originally plan to setup a corrupt government when he took power simply that he surrounded himself with like minded people whom he didn t know very well and who had served with him in the kgb they immediately began enriching themselves putin wanted to get rich too he was a pragmatic person we talked about this he didn t want to leave office poor as for the russian government s position with regards to pugachev it is claimed that pugachev defrauded the government of hundreds of millions of dollars which is why the one time bosom buddy of putin originally had to go on the run pugachev counters the state steals something then has to defend its theft in my case the scale is huge but in other respects this is a normal contemporary practice in russia this has all left the one time billionaire with by his own account only about 70 million to his name which he kept in off shore holdings it must be rough in truth this amount is unfortunate for him because pugachev allegedly was offered a deal from a russian official that if he paid 300 million to certain entities his legal issues in russia would be made to be resolved to his benefit and he could return to russia further siding in the camp that putin doesn t have hundreds of billions stashed away he officially owns the aforementioned karen dawisha who perhaps gives some of the best account and most concrete details of the alleged corruption within the russian government in her putin s kleptocracy book states that putin s real wealth comes from his position he takes what he wants when you are the president of russia you don t need a written contract you are the law again backing up this position financial investigator l burke files states putin controls wealth through proxies he then makes up examples to illustrate sergey owes his fortune to putin so when putin asks sergey a favor the favor must be honored a luxury cruise use of a private dacha expensive consumer goods etc ivan owns a shipping company and owes his wealth to putin so when putin requests a favor ivan like sergey honors the request so is putin the richest person in the world while as gaddafi demonstrated it is possible to squirrel away 200 billion secretly given the level of scrutiny thrown putin s way by governments the world over looking into the matter with nobody seemingly able to come up with any hard evidence most think this figure grossly inflated though it is generally accepted that he probably does have at least some significant amount stashed away somewhere for most however the explanation for his rather luxurious lifestyle is more reasonably explained by the simple fact that he can pretty much have the russian government foot the bill for anything he wants without much uproar or oversight and it does seem like an awful lot of his compatriots have gotten exceedingly wealthy during his tenure at least in part thanks to their connections with putin and him leveraging his position to help facilitate their enrichment thus if that is what has happened it s reasonable enough that many of those are happy to scratch his back whenever he feels the need for a new yacht or the like without putin needing to have anything in his name to avoid the backlash that would result should he be discovered to have such but as to answering the question of putin s own wealth as the consensus seems to be that most of his wealth is tied up in his position and associates rather than funds he directly has it seems a bit of a stretch to call him the richest man in the world though not a stretch at all if talking the money he currently has strong influence over his position as president of russia alone would be enough for that and as to the idea that he really does have 200 billion simply being held in other people s names as alluded to we re guessing even if many of these individuals are actually holding money for putin that should he step down from power and ask for that money be given to him en masse or even remain in power and ask for a combined sum of 200 billion that shortly thereafter memorials and monuments would be being built for the former russian leader who sadly died in his sleep of natural causes thus to sum up while given his lifestyle and various possessions putin most definitely does have access to quite a lot of wealth between the russian government and a lot of friends in high and wealthy places when talking his own assets there simply isn t any real hard data to date backing up the claim that he is the wealthiest person in the world and while not impossible certainly it would be quite the hat trick to squirrel away a couple hundred billion without any world governments able to find hard evidence that he owns a dime of it of course while some might argue access to vast sums should still count access is not ownership even if one can benefit from it on some level in the end unless he really is one of the lizard people he s probably not immortal so at some point in the next few decades he will shuffle off this mortal coil and perhaps then like gaddafi more definitive data will be revealed or perhaps sooner when he no longer has the protection of his position in 2024 as he is constitutionally unable to run for the presidency that year although of course he could always do as he did in 2008 and take a different position while remaining in power whatever the case for now at least while it is technically possible he does have 200 billion in secret and even probable that he has drastically more than he is letting on publicly which isn t difficult given his paltry public assets for a man in his position given the current data at hand the needle is seemingly tilted more towards gates and bezos being wealthier than putin at least in terms of money and assets they officially own if you liked this article you might also enjoy our new

the difference between success and failure in forex trading is very likely to depend upon which currency pairs you choose to trade each week and not on the exact trading methods you might use to determine trade entries and exits each week i am going to analyze fundamentals sentiment and technical positions in order to determine which currency pairs are most likely to produce the easiest and most profitable trading opportunities over the next week in some cases it will be trading the trend in other cases it will be trading support and resistance levels during more ranging markets big picture 15 th december 2019 in my previous piece last week i forecasted that the best trades would long of the s p 500 index following a daily new york close above 3154 and long of the gbp usd currency pair following a daily new york close above 1 3157 these were great calls especially for the gbp usd currency pair which closed at 1 3195 on wednesday and then ended the week up by 1 01 from there the s p 500 index closed above 3154 on thursday but ended the week basically unchanged last week s forex market saw the strongest rise in the relative value of the british pound and the strongest fall in the relative value of the japanese yen fundamental analysis market sentiment fundamental analysts are leaning in favor of the view that the recent quarter point cut in the u s interest rate will be the last cut for a while with jerome powell recently signaling there are likely to be no further cuts and maintaining an upbeat take on the u s economy the u s economy is still growing but there are some fears of a pending recession a major issue concerning sentiment on the u s and global economies is the trade dispute between the u s and china with the u s using the treating of new tariffs later this month as leverage in negotiations there is increasing hope that a deal will be signed soon which should be positive for the u s stock market however the deal has yet to materialize and friday saw the release of poorer than expected u s retail sales data and the dollar fell again over the past week the benchmark u s stock index the s p 500 ended the week at an all time weekly closing high price there are a few long term trends in the forex market notably a bullish trend in the british pound which is most strongly manifested in gbp usd and gbp jpy the long term bullish breakout made by the gbp usd was pushed to a climax by the landslide british election victory for the governing conservative party signaling a much firmer government and the exit of the u k from the e u at the end of january 2020 attention will now turn towards the likely terms of brexit upon which the british government will proceed technical analysis u s dollar index the weekly price chart below shows last week printed a large bearish candlestick although it closed within the top half of its price range the price is below its levels from both 3 and 6 months ago which is also a bearish sign the weekly close was the lowest in 6 months we have a preponderance of mostly bearish signs here suggesting that next week s action will most likely be bearish s p 500 index the weekly price chart below shows that last week printed a bullish candlestick which closed near its high and above all its weekly closing prices of all time these are bullish signs suggesting that the price is likely to rise further over the coming week gbp usd the price made its highest weekly close in 9 months at the end of last week it had already made a long term bullish breakout and then spiked strongly to a price beyond the psychological round number at 1 3500 as the strong conservative victory in the u k s general election became clear in the early hours of friday the price subsequently sold off on buy the rumor sell the fact much will now depend upon whether the price can make a daily close over this coming week above 1 3329 which would indicate a further rise over the week is somewhat likely however it is quite possible that the price will continue to drift down over the coming days as attention turns towards the details of the brexit that is bound to happen now within just a few weeks conclusion this week i forecast the best trades are likely to be long of the s p 500 index following a daily new york close above 3170 and long of the gbp usd currency pair following a daily new york close above 1 3329
by barani krishnan investing com will commodity markets buy the u s china story if friday s rally in oil suggests anything it is that investors are beginning to feel confident that the pall hovering over markets for nearly 18 months from the trade war could finally be lifting and it s time to get long with natural resources as inflation could pick up from here yet if last week s rise in gold prices is taken into account the narrative could be different while gold is part of the commodity universe it serves a very distinct function that other raw materials don t gold is a hedge to weak currencies and threats to the global economy which includes the trade war the fact that the yellow metal did not sell off last week is a sign that investors want a continued hedge against the fear factor called donald trump the vacillating moods and ways of the u s president and what that could do to the second phase of the negotiations between the two countries is still a major wildcard for markets crude oil prices hit three month highs on friday with u s west texas intermediate breaching the 60 per barrel resistance long eyed by oil bulls and u k brent crossing the key 65 milestone after trump announced a limited u s china trade deal with scant details the clincher of his so called phase one deal was of course the president s willingness to withhold new u s tariffs of 15 originally due from dec 15 on 160 billion of chinese made goods that included iphones toys and other popular consumer products the office of us trade representative however said it will maintain duties of 25 on 250 billion of other chinese imports and another 7 5 tax on a separate batch of products worth 120 billion as the white house negotiates to sell tens of billions of dollars of us farm products a year to china the chinese barely said anything and that s the problem without a televised signing there was no way of knowing if the chinese really agreed to everything trump was saying or were just buying time as political expediency seemed to be the essence here with trump seeking re election in 11 months his focus appears to be on getting as many wins as possible as his democratic rivals in congress try to impeach him for alleged abuse of office china s president xi jinping is meanwhile under pressure to halt any more tariffs that could hurt the world s second largest economy with so much that has transpired in the past 17 months markets expect precise details on what the two sides have agreed to in order to gauge the success of future negotiations said adam sarhan founder and chief executive at 50 park investments a global markets investment advisory service in orlando florida the devil is really in the details and there s very little of that here fawad razaqzada a london based analyst at forex com who specializes in gold and currencies concurred negotiations for phase two deal will depend on the implementation of phase one deal razaqzada said this could be another long back and forth type of a situation keeping investors on their toes with politics likely to influence the outcome more than any other factor the chinese also appear reluctant to give in too much now when they might have a relatively easier process if a new u s president comes into office in 2021 the fraught path ahead was reinforced by trump s tweet on friday that phase two negotiations will commence immediately instead of after the elections the chinese did not commit to a date there are risks both because of the general unpredictability associated with trump s diplomatic style as well as the uncertainties that could arise from an altered approach in the event that trump loses the 2020 presidential election richard anderson falk an international law professor and china expert at princeton university was quoted as saying a democrat in the white house would be sure to approach trade policy with china in a different manner and somewhat more likely in a manner that would make further progress in a rebalancing process more likely to be successful added falk us china aside markets also have something else to chew on boris johnson s landslide election victory that should finally pave the way for brexit the jury is still out on how much market upheaval could be expected even from an orderly u k exit from the european union for what it s worth nymex traded the u s crude benchmark rose more than more than 1 on the week settling at 60 45 per barrel wti had not seen 60 levels since the september attack on saudi arabia s oil facilities

friday s market showed that oil traders and their headline reading algorithms appeared to have bought trump s china deal more than the traders and machines punting on the stock market while crude rallied without much restraint stocks on wall street fell from early highs and closed just higher on lingering uncertainties about a 17 month trade war that had sparked hundreds of billions of dollars of tit for tariffs and often acrimonious remarks that weighed not just on the two economies involved but also world growth oil is probably catching up after playing laggard to wall street which had gone gung ho in recent days on the hype over the likelihood of a trade deal said sarhan the ceo at 50 park investments in orlando with stocks it s a classic case of buy the rumor sell the fact he said and that s accentuated by the fact that there are scant details so far on this deal and the devil is really in the details with something like this oil prices were weakened earlier in the week after a surprise rise in and huge builds in and crude markets were also hit by the paris based international energy agency s monthly report on wednesday that said global inventories could rise sharply through

aliu has spent more than 4 years in ife wara mining sites he has worked for over 10 different unlicensed companies as labourer as he later confirmed he is currently with the 11th and still hoping to make more living from the gold farming lands he divulged that couple of months ago the present mining site was a very fruitful cocoa farm it was just earlier this year that the chinese brought heavy machines to this site and crushed away all the cocoa tree on the land i can t really say the farmers were really paid but i saw them coming here afterwards crying one afternoon and till now we have been here working money dey here ooo he said smoking and laughing to show his excitement aliu left this reporter to take his digger and jumped into the heavy water logged section of the site to source welcome to store where gold is a street business for someone hearing store as a name of a community for the first time may have varieties of interpretation and inferences the close thought will be a particular building for cocoa storage and trading exactly that s the grand idea behind the naming a long time ago but now it s for gold for a minor in store a densely populated area with a hybrid of yoruba and hausa artisanal miners mining is the first exposition store is a small community in atakumosa east beside igila village in ilesha informal and illegal mining here in store have been seen as a norm to the extent that bargaining of farmland is done without formal agreement nor signing of any paper thereby making gold mining and trading the only doable business here for a land to be bought for mining it has to be tested which the intending buyer pays n10 000 the expanse of the land dictates the amount to pay for it after the land has been confirmed positive the positivity then dictates how expensive the land will be sold this reporter disguised as a part two student of geology in obafemi awolowo university who s on the verge of getting an assignment done which worth 30 marks ran into a popular gold miner and gold black marketer legendary single 2 single 2 left ifewara in 2014 for ilesa since then he has moved from one gold rich community of ilesa to another till store where this reporter met him he owns a kiosk like shop close to the express road that leads to the mining farms as you are seeing this place like this it s n3 000 naira per month it s even less some people rented theirs for n4 000 5 00 we are all making our sales especially during raining season if you can wait for more minutes you will see as my clients will be bringing market for me you will see how we dry it and sieve the sand away they are just being late today maybe they are still in farm mining in a nigeria extractive industries transparency initiative neiti 2016 report shows that presently the informal mining sector dominates the mining activities in nigeria the report also contains the details of 1 200 registered mining cooperatives across the six geo political zones of the country mainly represented by the artisanal or small mining asm actors black market display in video section on not long after this reporter was planning to call it a day when two teenagers musa and adnan entered single 2 s shop for business the shop owner is a middle man popularly addressed as single two musa 16 had worked on a mining site where he stole a bit of raw gold into an emptied sachet of water to sell for single 2 he does this not frequently only when they aren t paid hugely for the work done for the day the money made from this kind of trading makes dinner for him and his friend adnan both left zamfara in 2018 when mining activities in the state turned grey they both followed zubair a suya seller to osun state to learn from the business and serve as an apprentice to him before they noticed digger and other artisanal mining instruments are sold in every shop in store this gave a pointer to the duo which they now continue mining instead of their earlier intention single 2 musa and adnan chorused with an amused face which was met with a grin from single 2 s too as he understands they were there with market adnan 17 lamented how they were unduly paid by the owner of the site they worked on due to the fact that they were seen to be young while not considering their level of professionalism at a side of the shop is a 2kg gas cylinder and spoons of different sizes musa brought out the stolen gold particles from his trouser tied to his right thigh he put the particles which is thrice of a pinch of salt into a sizeable spoon and placed it on lit gas burner this process enables quick separation of sands from the gold particles musa was given a new n1000 note to place the remaining particles which will give a better separation as he blew away other sand particles the got gold particles were placed on the scaling machine which was weighed to worth n2 000 in values single 2 divulged to this reporter that gold particles of this size using the upper part of his thumb as a perfect example is around 5million naira like ibodi like ilesa image just like ibodi in ife iwara the land degradation activities on the visited mining sites is huge and posing environmental hazards for a stranger like this reporter it is always best for the person to follow the foot traces on the ground if not any miscalculation of steps can lead to the death of the person this is based on how the lands have been dug just walk on the same path with me if you like do otherwise those grounds you are seeing bare having been connectedly dug from one side to another if you step on it you are gone ooo single 2 said this while taking this reporter on a visit to a mining site situated inside an army barrack in the community the land was said to be sold by the authority of the barrack following a forensic survey of the land and was confirmed to be positive we are already planning to leave students of the osun state college of education ilesa residing in ajangila hostel have lamented the desperate attempts of artisanal miners mining centimeters to their resident alledged of several attempts to dig pass their hostel image image agangila hostel is a storey building located meters away from osu ilesa road in atakumosa east the mining site beside this building has made students who are more than 40 in number searching for new hostel due to the fear of the building sinking overnight according to a resident of the hostel the hostel and the land were inherited by the sons of a late chief in the community the mining activities on the land started earlier last year the house was willed to a son of the chief s first wife while the land is for the second wife s eldest son we have complained to them that we use to hear them digging close to our rooms but our caretaker seems not to take it seriously the other son sold the land to a rich man earlier last year and can you see see them that s how they will dig till evening we are already planning to leave we are leaving after this semester imagine we sinking overnight can gold exploration sustain osun state gold is used for stability of paper currencies jewelries in alloys with platinum it is used in dentistry and it is used as a coating on aircraft engine a research paper published in 2014 in european journal of business and management titled mineral prospecting potentials of osun state written by ajeigbe o m adeniran o j and babalola o a of department of banking and finance osun state polytechnic iree proves that 20 million ounces of gold occur in atakunmosa east atakunmosa west and ife east of osun state as the quantity available was discovered to be exploitable over a period of 50 years at an economic rate of about 850 ounces supply per day the research exposed that a total of 15 300 000 ounces is the minimum available gold in osun state which amounts to over n263 billion this is justified on the premise that the supply of gold at an economic rate of 850 ounces per day is the only rate that can last osun state for a period of 50 years and more without diminishing in quantity with more discovery of gold in the state it can only increase 850 ounces supply per day but it never reduces it according to a professor of geology olugbenga akindeji okunlola of the university of ibadan in 2017 also in his research finding entitled riches beneath our feet mineral endowment and sustainable development of nigeria postulated that the gold deposit in osun state is worth 5 billion which equals n1 5trillion at current cbn rate he said iperindo in ilesha osun state has a proven reserve of one million ounces in a 1km2 area up to a shallow 100m depth comprising a series of gold bearing gold quartz carbonate veins localised by subsidiary faults hosted within biotite gneiss and mica schist grade ranges between 1 23 6g ton currently this deposit is worth over 1 billion the worth of the ilesha gold belt occurrences could be in the range of 3 1 to 5 billion at current price regime nigeria might well be the new frontier in the coming years for gold exploration in west africa he said he added that if it is mined and osun takes 13 derivation that is some n200 billion revenue over the lifespan of gold mining the professor explained that the federal government does not mine any deposit as her main function is to regulate mining activities federal government does not own any mining company what federal government does is to regulate the mining activities so if anybody can collect a license once you fulfill all the rules and requirements professor okunlola also expatiated why state governments are at the receiving end of the gains from the mining in fact state governments have more advantage because they know where the resources are the state themselves have every opportunity to even get licenses for choice areas so what the law says is that its not for bureaucracy form a company like osun state livingspring company or omoluabi company get licenses like they have which i am aware of osun state has about six to seven licenses on gold alone and they form joint ventures whatever comes out of that joint ventures if they have formed a joint venture for example with segilola and they co fund they will be part of the over 2billion naira asset of segilola and do you know it is projected that by 2030 that gold will be selling for 2000 per ounce in contrast for the whole of 2016 osun state collected n5 9 billion as federation allocation and internally generated n8 89 billion while in 2017 and 2018 the state received n10 4b n22 8b and generated n13 49b n20 2bn respectively through management diligent exploration and sincere dedication to end illegal and informal mining in the state osun state can be one of the financially independent states in nigeria this also will lift osun out of her drowning domestic and international debt which at present sums up to over n169 9 billion agbabu where economic resources are left untapped image image aside gold nigeria is also greatly endowed with large deposit of other mineral resources that are left bare naked and untouched agbabu s bitumen in ondo state is an instance nigeria is ranked as one of the first five countries in the world endowed with largest deposit of natural bitumen however research activities on the vast deposit of agbabu natural bitumen in nigeria have largely been concentrated on the physico chemical and engineering characterization the nigeria bitumen reserves are found in lagos ogun ondo and edo states agbabu in ondo state is known for her high deposit of natural bitumen which rakes huge amount of nigerian bitumen deposit nigeria being one of the largest producers of crude oil however the mid stream sector of the oil and gas sector has made her heavily dependent on importing refined petroleum products and this includes bitumen currently nigeria s annual consumption of bitumen is a little over 500 000 metric tonnes and the market has been quite stable and increasing due to the epileptic performance of the kaduna refinery which is the only refinery in the country that produces bitumen at the moment this reporter visited two observatory wells built by the defunct nigerian bitumen corporation nbc located opposite saint stephen s primary school agbabu and the other close to the community head s house as observed the bitumen deposit is so much in the ground to the extent it is forced out to the surface this has made the marshy area where these wells are to be firm and seeming as if it is tarred according to mr abraham a member of the community told this reporter that they know quite well that we have bitumen which has been a point of attraction we have no problem with it but i am not educated but i know this can make this state richer if tapped mr abraham the septuagenarian has been living and farming in the village for over 45 years he expressed that the only moment they feel happy having bitumen on their land is when the representative from the federal government comes to check yearly don t go there no one dares to mr abraham answered with full strength while this reporter quizzed if he has ever heard of illegal tapping of the resources we can never take that here no one can even try it without being led here by the government we have it in abundance we want make government tap it and make our people employed you can also see it flowing out already our children are jobless we are just tired here but hopeful according to an academic paper nigeria has been reported to have a proven reserve of about 42 47 billion tons of bitumen almost twice the amount of existing reserves of crude petroleum but yet to be explored for economic purposes geologists economists blame state government a professional geologist and former ogun state permanent secretary ipinniwa steve commented that the political will to diversify from oil is the only contraint bewildering nigeria from attaining the desired economic status we have potentials in every mineral sector we have very blessed in this country our problem is that we have been paying less attention to solid minerals some of believes that if our attention as nation is tilted to the sector it can bring us the economic status we have been clamouring for if we are to talk of sustainability and other things let s ask for political with it do you know when bitumen was first discovered in the country and we continue to import the bulk of this lies on the state government but we can still blame them too when the mining act gives less power to the state atiku samuel and economist and budgit research lead also shared similar view with the ipinniwa the condemned the structural issues surrounding the extractive sector generally and called for revamping of the whole system which he opined that this can cure the sickening economy you begin to wonder why the state which are endowed with this mineral resources still suffer for economic survival the faac is there to tell you that there is little significance these resources hold to their economy virtually less connection the structural problem is all mineral resources in the ground is being owned by the federal government of the federation and that is by design as such states like kogi zamfara osun can not independently bring in investors and invest in these solid minerals that s one thing limestone also is a solid mineral kogi produces limestone likewise ogun state but we need to look at their igr and revenue distribution and you to ask yourself some difficult questions that how much is the federal government of nigeria earning from these things it is totally non existing if you look at faac and what government earns from solid mineral then look at how much kogi osun ogun are getting individually in terms of 13 derivative you will be shocked that it is nearly zero that shows that less attention is paid to solid mineral another thing that will shock you is that there is no incentive whatsoever for these states with solid minerals i don t think the principle around the fiscal governance around solid minerals in nigeria is actually favourable to the people the general assumption there is that the solid mineral sector in nigeria by design to fuel what we call private accumulation absolutely i can tell you if these states are independent in thinking and have the will to turn the sector they will be able to stand on their own my general assumption is yes you can use the solid mineral in your state to build a basics for you to have a vibrant economy hope on the way image in the last economic summit held in osun state which lasted for 3 days 19th 21st of november 2019 the state governor gboyega oyetola disclosed that the state has received a sum of n100 million from badger mines a canada based mining company as sign on fee for exploration and development of one of the state s mining titles the governor disclosed that the government had earlier executed a memorandum of understanding mou with the mining company as part of necessary preparation for the commencement of mining operations in the state he said our mining sector like agriculture is an old industry yet to be fully harnessed the state of osun has ample reserves of a variety of minerals notably gold lead zinc quartz feldspar and several precious metals we occupy a unique place in the mining sector in nigeria we are a mining state that hosts solid minerals we are also a state that has invested in acquiring the licences for solid minerals under our land from the federal government no other state in nigeria can offer the unique combination of both regulatory and commercial fusion we are a risk ready state with an appetite for enterprise and reward for winnings the state acquired 17 mining licenses for gold 10 quarry 4 lead zinc 2 and quartz and feldspar 1 from the nigeria mining corporation and we are willing to partner with interested local and foreign investors to develop these mineral resources our policy for the mining sector is implemented and overseen by the osun solid mineral development programme this programme commenced in june 2019 and has already achieved some encouraging milestones in its first quarterly report in 5 of the 7 intervention project areas of the programme the intervention areas are osun omoluabi mining business restructuring scheme ombrs to commercialise the state owned mining company osun revenue diversification and maximisation scheme ordms is a scheme to register all miners mines and mining equipment and report on all mining activities in the state in partnership with private sector technology partners we are happy to report that 9 000 artisanal miners have registered their biometric data on rfid enabled tags with our technology partners i am also happy to inform you that osun recently executed an mou with the renowned international mining firm the badger mines for the exploration and development of one of our mining titles with a signature bonus of a hundred million naira n100m already paid
iowa farmers and manufacturers relying on exports have good reason to celebrate now that the trump administration and majority house democrats have reached agreement on a new north american trade deal the u s mexico canada agreement or usmca would replace the outdated 1994 north american trade agreement which president donald trump called our country s worst trade deal when the new deal is enacted senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said it will be addressed after an impeachment trial it would be an improvement over nafta it has incentives to boost north american auto manufacturing safety environmental concerns and protection of intellectual property while lifting some agricultural restrictions while all are worthy pursuits president donald trump s hardball negotiating tactics inflicted collateral damage on u s and iowa agriculture and manufacturing after imposing tariffs on canadian and mexican steel and aluminum their retaliation cost u s farmers dearly contributing to the 33 percent decline in iowa farm income from 2013 to 2018 the two countries account for 43 billion in farm exports annually pork exports to mexico declined 13 in volume and 29 in dollar value immediately after the tariffs canada 4 2 billion and mexico 2 3 billion ranked 1 2 in iowa exports in 2018 according to the office of the u s trade representative including 1 1 billion in agricultural products iowa state university predicted in september 2018 that trump s tariff wars could create a 2 2 billion hit on the state economy although u s negotiators reached agreement with mexico and canada in september 2018 the particulars weren t revealed until may democrats balked at patent protection for pharmaceutical companies and had labor and environmental concerns given the democrats antipathy to big pharma usmca was a nonstarter with 10 years of exclusivity for biologics made from living organisms groundbreaking drugs such as anti inflammatory humira cancer fighter rituxan and enbrel for rheumatoid arthritis big pharma maintains such drugs are expensive to develop priced at about 100 000 annually according to the food and drug administration they account for 2 of all u s prescriptions but 40 of drug spending currently the u s provides 12 years of exclusivity canada eight and mexico five the usmca initially had 10 years of patent protection democrats were believed to favor seven years allowing generic biosimilars to enter the market sooner they worried locking in 10 years would be a template for future trade bills sinking domestic reform efforts the new version has no timetable while replacing language for extending patent protections when pharmaceutical companies find a new use for an existing product the new deal increases the percentage of auto parts made in north america from 62 5 to 75 to be tariff free if 40 are made in a high wage factory paying workers at least 16 per hour without an inflation index that s triple the pay for mexican workers who get more opportunities to unionize the pact will have new enforceable labor standards and safety regulations including inspections of suspect mexican manufacturing sites the international trade commission estimates that could add 28 000 u s manufacturing jobs the trump administration says 76 000 the downside according to some economists is that it will boost prices possibly prompting more small profit compact cars to be made in asia of note the usmca requires mexican trucks crossing the border to meet long overdue safety standards significant environmental improvements include protecting whales fish and other marine wildlife from pollution and overfishing mexico will do more to stop illegal fishing and subsidies for overfished species will end mexico also will ensure it is only exporting legally harvested goods tighter protections for patents and trademarks for intellectual and digital property from biotech to financial services include issues unforeseen 25 years ago in agriculture 97 percent of products had no tariffs but canada would open its market to more dairy products while the u s would allow for more canadian dairy and peanut products plus a limited amount of sugar despite nafta criticisms by trump and the far left it wasn t such a bad deal matthew slaughter dean of the tuck school of business at dartmouth college wrote in the wall street journal in january 2018 after canvassing dozens of academic and policy studies i find that the u s gross domestic product is now 0 2 percent to 0 3 percent larger than it would be without nafta a yearly boost of about 50 billion but an overhaul was needed sen charles grassley r iowa acknowledged majority house democrats concerns had to be addressed but now some republicans are unhappy it s clearly moved way to the left said sen patrick toomey r pa said but those concerns aren t sufficient to sink it in the senate grassley should try to convince his friend sen mcconnell that iowa farmers and others dependent on exports shouldn t needlessly wait any longer get the usmca passed asap photos the newly opened driftless style 111219bp driftless style 7 jpg 111219bp driftless style 1 jpg 111219bp

bond yields dropped sharply this year as concerns about the global economy rose in october the international monetary fund s world economic outlook warned of a synchronised global slowdown to the weakest pace since the 2008 09 global financial crisis as the world economy is pummelled by the us china trade war which is inflicting a sharp deterioration in global manufacturing and trade the imf cut its global growth forecast to 3 per cent for fiscal 2019 at the time saying growth continues to be weakened by rising trade barriers and increasing geopolitical tensions the weekend s trade deal between the us and china is set to go some way to supporting the global economy it will halt the tariffs that were due to be implemented on sunday but also paves the way for winding back some of the existing duties on chinese goods chinese officials also said china would buy more american agricultural products us agriculture is a key signpost to monitor as the phase one deal appears to be ag centric and may moderately boost us crop prices and volatility said citi economists led by cesar rojas the phase one de escalation is good news for now and takes some pressure off the global economy which makes it good news for commodity prices and australia said shane oliver chief economist at amp capital regarding the outlook for the asx dr oliver noted last year didn t really come until after christmas owing to us related political risks this year it may be coming early thanks to the recent decline in various geopolitical threats advertisement but some investors were reluctant to wholeheartedly embrace the idea that global risks have receded pointing out that a lot of uncertainty remains both for the trade negotiations and britain s exit from the eu the phase one trade deal is positive for the outlook relative to continued trade war escalation but there is still a lot of uncertainty said economists at td securities they pointed out that while the us120 billion 174 million of tariffs on imports that were imposed by the us in september will be reduced to 7 5 per cent from 15 per cent an earlier tranche of 25 per cent tariffs on us250 billion of imports is set to remain in place until phase two negotiations take place clarity is also lacking on the actual volumes of chinese soybean grain and pork purchases while details of firm commitments are lacking and likely to be worked out and phased in over a few years said the economists at citi uncertainty is likely to remain they said and some strategists point out that boris johnson s stunning victory in the uk election hasn t made the country s path to leaving the eu any easier the country will formally leave the eu on january 31 but the newly elected prime minister now has barely a year to negotiate a long term free trade deal with europe when a standstill transition period expires at the end of the year this is just the end of the beginning the real work of negotiating the uk s future trading relationship with the eu lies ahead and that has the potential to become very complicated said t rowe price portfolio manager quentin fitzsimmons assuming the uk leaves the eu on january 31 our focus will be on the trade negotiations which are likely to be complicated and fractious
sacramento gavin newsom the 40th governor of the state of california emerges from the door to his private office with a sigh sorry i m late says newsom 52 i was watching the impeachment hearings for newsom president donald trump is often unavoidable these days he and the president continue to be at loggerheads in fact newsom s position as leader of the so dubbed california resistance helped him get elected on nov 7 2018 but some critics contend the governor s first year in office has been diluted by this feud resulting in a lack of progress on huge issues a mushrooming homeless population astronomical housing prices a dangerous electrical grid that have led pundits to write eulogies for the age old california dream newsom is resolute the dream will live on in spite of trump one of the biggest stories that hasn t gotten full media attention is the assault by the president on the american people who happen to be residents of the largest state of our union newsom says in an exclusive year end interview with usa today but california is thriving despite him so far polls say most californians like the job newsom has done since being sworn in jan 7 with 44 approving and 32 disapproving according to a survey by the public policy institute of california but while newsom campaigned last fall on the enduring attraction of the mythic and potent california dream egalitarianism upward mobility natural beauty that postcard image has taken a hit homelessness is soaring 25 of the nation s 600 000 homeless live in california in san francisco alone apps have sprouted up to track human waste on sidewalks people with mental illnesses have attacked other residents and some companies most recently oracle have canceled downtown convention plans housing costs are driving away the middle class the median home price in california is 550 000 twice the national average according to zillow more than 28 190 people departed california in the second quarter of 2019 almost double 2017 s rate according to a regular migration report from real estate brokerage redfin and california s already prevalent wildfires now have an added menace this year s days long pacific gas electric power grid shutdowns wreaked havoc particularly on seniors and the poor along with fires they cost the state s economy 11 5 billion according to bank of the west chief economist scott anderson to newsom s constituents taking on trump is one task governing the state is another altogether he ran as a leader of the trump resistance and he s been all in there and gets full marks says thad kousser chair of the university of california san diego political science department and author of the power of american governors so the next step will be to really get a coherent policy agenda set and implemented california s duel with trump leading that resistance has been time consuming and trump is fighting back in ways that affect the state s policies over the past year trump has threatened to withhold federal aid for wildfire recovery on grounds that the state isn t managing its forests has suggested federal oversight is needed to fix the state s homelessness epidemic and has vowed to revoke the state s authority to set strict auto emissions standards most recently trump has ordered that federal lands in california be open to fracking style oil drilling just as newsom halted all fracking permits so that their ecological impact could be studied first meanwhile lawmakers in newsom s overwhelmingly democratic legislature passed a bill requiring trump to turn over his tax records if he wanted to be on the ballot in 2020 that chess move was overturned by the california supreme court but the jab landed california is a disgrace to our country trump told a cincinnati crowd days after the bill was passed in july some state lawmakers are concerned about newsom s slow pace of progress on the traditional parts of his job newsom has a democratic majority in the legislature and what has he done with it says assemblyman devon mathis a republican from the central valley agricultural town of visalia conditions have gotten worse and gorgeous cities like san francisco and los angeles are cesspools he says and many of us are trying to take care of our families praying to god we don t have a mishap and end up in the poverty line you re the governor you have the ability to do something not just talk newsom says he is well aware of the criticism and he asks for time we expect to be held accountable we expect people to demand more they want to see evidence of change he says all i can say is we got here 11 damn months ago and in the next few years if they don t see change they can make a change at the ballot box and they should if we don t produce real results although newsom doesn t offer a specific timeline he says this coming year should bring progress as a result of steps taken over the past year these include releasing 650 million to municipalities to address homelessness fining cities that push back against affordable housing initiatives and signing 22 wildfire related bills while increasing oversight over bankrupt utility pg e whose aging and faulty lines have sparked some of the deadly fires newsom also points out that in his first year he has signed numerous laws that are in keeping with california s progressive political track record these include a ban on facial recognition software in police body cameras granting sexual assault victims more time to sue and expanding gun seizure rules plan for 3 5 million new homes now a stretch housing newsom admits is perhaps his greatest challenge since it affects both the poor and the middle class the engine of the state s massive economy which totaled 3 trillion in 2018 during his inauguration speech newsom promised a marshall plan for affordable housing referencing u s aid to post world war ii europe he vowed to build 3 5 million new housing units by 2025 but in the first half of 2019 california cities approved 11 fewer residential building permits than the same period in 2018 according to a july report from the california department of finance he now calls the 3 5 million unit figure a stretch goal still newsom says the coming years should see growth in new affordable housing the housing issue which is so key to that california dream we have to hit that one head on newsom says so we have 4 5 billion from the private sector including 2 5 billion from tim cook at apple in the form of land for affordable housing first time homebuyer assistance and more he says we put in 1 75 billion in state money we re suing cities we also putting up money to help cities plan for housing we re looking at land use policies i hope in the next year or so we ll see movement but there s no silver bullet nothing happens overnight as mayor of the southern california surf hub of huntington beach erik peterson isn t so sure about newsom s housing strategy i m not a fan says peterson whose city newsom sued early in his tenure as governor for failing to permit enough new housing under him we re getting a more authoritarian sacramento says peterson the state says everyone will do what we say you need to rezone your suburban neighborhoods to be urban centers well we get pushback on that from our residents instead peterson says newsom should worry more about infrastructure and education which are falling apart and let s make california business friendly again if you have jobs people can afford the houses in the northern california town of chico mayor randall stone an affordable housing developer applauds newsom for being the first governor in recent memory to put money and emphasis on housing stone said he pulled newsom aside when the governor visited earlier in the year to check on the recovery of nearby paradise which was decimated by fire in 2018 stone told him the reason there s no building of affordable housing is we re disincentivized to blame stone says are property and sales tax rates that only go up 2 a year and do not keep pace with employee salaries and other municipal costs that often results in city halls being more likely to approve commercial building projects like shopping malls and auto dealerships because they bring in more tax revenue but i m not sure he can snap his fingers and fix that stone says they re longstanding systemic issues newsom cautions that if a not in my backyard attitude persists at a municipal level state initiated housing assistance is moot all this nimby ism society becomes how we behave he says this can t be i got mine why don t you focus that over there we ve got to own it we have to transfer that energy of angst toward a real follow through and i m just getting started newsom white house dreams some wonder where newsom wants to end up an entrepreneurial stint running his plumpjack winery company aside newsom has been in politics since becoming a san francisco city supervisor at 29 he became mayor at age 36 and lieutenant governor at 42 many california political observers consider newsom s presidential ambition to be one of the state s worst kept secrets both the bust of john f kennedy that sits on his desk as well as the photo of his smiling late father william newsom a state appeals court judge with former u s attorney general robert f kennedy seem to draw an invisible line between the photogenic governor and camelot but newsom consistently shoots down the speculation that he is preparing for a white house run later this decade honestly no interest he says indeed with its 40 million residents one in eight u s citizens calls california home newsom presides over nothing short of a nation state despite trump administration efforts california still sets its own climate change goals brokers its own deals with some of the world s leading automakers on tailpipe emissions and puts stakes in the ground when it comes to immigration policies such as its recent ban on privately run immigration detention centers our role is potent and powerful substantively so at this moment says newsom but while insisting that 1600 pennsylvania ave is not on his radar newsom said he feels confident about democratic chances to take the white house in 2020 we ve offered a lot of different flavors from progressive to conservative and we ll be well positioned to unite around somebody at a time when we need to do so to take out one of the worst presidents in american history he says newsom was supportive of longtime friend and sometime political rival sen kamala harris including planning an iowa trip to tout her candidacy before it was scratched when harris ended her campaign dec 3 of her withdrawal he says simply she had the burden of high expectations that she set herself after outperforming many people who have had far more years on the national stage whether it was watching harris soar then nosedive or simply tacitly acknowledging success in his first term as governor is key to any presidential run he says california has all his attention this is the office of the governor of california the fifth largest economy in the world he says looking around the room it s earl warren s office ronald reagan s office pat brown not just jerry brown it s the best job in the world newsom s bliss a recycling plant over the past 11 months newsom has kept up a busy travel schedule within the state often away from sacramento at least one or two days a week he has visited those displaced by fires up north comforted shooting victims down south and talked about water scarcity with farmers in the central valley what little free time he has back in the capital he dedicates to his wife filmmaker jennifer siebel newsom and their four kids all under 10 to unwind the governor says he likes to take his kids to the local fish hatchery and his favorite the recycling plant i m not sure what it is about seeing tens of thousands of things bouncing around but you get into that space and relax and zone out newsom says laughing but those who know him best suggest the governor relishes negotiating california s many vexing issues gavin s the happiest in the eye of the storm and that s where he s been all year long says nathan ballard founder of the press shop media relations firm and newsom s former mayoral press secretary he recalls the heat newsom happily took for allowing same sex couples to marry in 2004 a stand that anticipated a national movement the longtime friend and informal adviser says that while it s not in gavin s nature to relax ballard and a small group did manage to take newsom away from sacramento in october hauling him off to a rustic marin county restaurant to celebrate the governor s birthday that was fun but he knows that now it s time for him not just to survive a crisis but to make this state a better place to live says ballard and the proof will be on the streets simple as that newsom a self confessed policy wonk says he plans to get results over the coming years by learning everything he can about as many thorny california issues as possible governing is all about nuance the details he says simple program passing isn t problem solving when everyone else is running off to the next thing i have to dig into it all to be sure we can implement changes effectively i m accountable that approach has critics like mathis the visalia assemblymember shaking his head newsom seems like he s trying to solve every problem in the state by himself says mathis whose fellow state republican party officials recently endorsed long shot efforts to get newsom recalled as governor he needs to step up and start to delegate authority out and do so by stepping across the aisle governor swings at many pitches for anthony rendon who has been california s state assembly speaker since 2016 newsom stands apart from his predecessor brown who was uniquely not interested in many issues precisely because he cares about more newsom matter of factly says he is not capable of not trying to solve a problem so if today s critique is we re swinging at a lot of pitches absolutely that is fair criticism but he adds do i tell a senior citizen sorry i can t help with your prescription because my team says i just need to focus on a couple of things do you tell kids preschool can t be a priority because my communications staff think i should stay on wildfires do you tell wildfire folks listen we did some polling and it looks like this year it s got to be housing and homelessness newsom s eyebrows arch my point is he says when you look at those trade offs as governor you just know it all has to somehow be on the agenda one thing is certain with a 2020 to do list as high profile as newsom s start building new affordable housing shelter the homeless across the state fix a broken gas and electricity utility engage the republican president in battle it will be easy for voters here to keep score but what would he say to someone who has given up on california s golden dream and isn t willing to wait for newsom to polish it i would tell those folks i have a sensitivity to that they re not wrong the median price of a home is comically high in california he says veering off into details on his team s deep dives on housing solutions with city officials in vancouver and singapore but then newsom resets i m empathetic and sympathetic and it s disturbing to me he says but that said i feel for them you re missing the opportunities this state can provide we had a historic decade in venture capital investment a historic decade of job creation there is no trump economy without california s success this is florence in its golden age sure there are costs associated with that success yes but if we can balance those out boy the sky s the limit follow usa today national correspondent marco della cava marcodellacava

for the first time in many a year nigeria may have a budget ready for implementation from the beginning of the fiscal year following the senate s early approval of the 2020 budget this is welcome progress unfortunately this annual ritual has made very little impact on the lives of nigerians we go through this farcical exercise every year repeating the same mistakes and expecting a different outcome we agree a budget the government knows from day one cannot be delivered in full because of unrealistic assumptions of income and expenditure and then expect to have good roads about a quarter n2 4 trillion of the aggregate expenditure proposed for 2020 will go towards debt servicing leaving a paltry n7 0trn for capital n2 1trn and recurrent n4 8 trillion expenditure the government is proposing to finance the entire capital budget and some element of recurrent expenditure from borrowing because the nigerian economy is not generating enough revenue to adequately fund the country s budgetary needs apart from perhaps lagos economic activity across the rest of the country is stagnant or at best sluggish with a begging bowl the government is looking for help wherever it can find it interestingly aliko dangote has become nigerian s donor of last resort stepping in to bail out a government in dire need of money dangote is building public roads and transport infrastructure dangote is building a refinery dangote is renovating the national stadium dangote is building a rice mill to feed the nation plus many other dangote interventions nigerians are quite rightly asking if we should not just hand the country over to dangote as the de facto government advertisement addressing nigeria s funding challenges would require making difficult policy choices that may not be popular but nonetheless in the best interest of the country fuel subsidy or cost under recovery as it is now referred remains the biggest albatross to nigeria s economic development depriving nigeria of much needed funds for job creation and infrastructural development a lagos based financial derivatives firm estimates that fuel subsidy or loss of revenue from cost under recovery in 2019 could be as much as 5 billion n1 8 trillion more than the combined capital and re current budgets for education health policing transport and works and housing this is money that could have gone into addressing the county s power challenges fixing our roads investing in the railway infrastructure funding education and health services and creating millions of direct and indirect jobs for the masses of unemployed nigerians the president at his inaugural june 12 address this year promised nigerians a reduction in poverty by 100 million in 10 years but proposing a measly n48 billion capital for education is more likely to increase not reduce poverty you reduce poverty by investing the enormous sums currently used to subsidise petrol in quality education skills training and job creating infrastructure the n2 1trn proposed for capital in the 2020 budget falls far short of what is needed to spur any meaningful economic growth however the government must first put its house in order before seeking further loans poor productivity and waste continue to be the hallmark of the public sector nigeria is believed to have over six hundred agencies and parastatals many of these parastatals have allegedly become conduits for corruption and money laundering serving primarily the interest of the board and their ceos with zero value add to the country advertisement there is something fundamentally wrong in a budget that allocates n125bn to the national assembly and n46bn capital to health for a population of 200 million if you have any serious medical condition like cancer in nigeria today the prognosis for over 90 per cent of the population who cannot travel abroad for treatment is dire thousands of our fellow citizens are dying every single day from treatable conditions because of the lack of drugs and basic medical equipment whilst the ruling elite are on the plane to the us and europe at the first hint of a headache unashamedly enjoying health facilities abroad they have denied their fellow citizens at great cost to the treasury the usa the world s richest economy with a gdp of about 20 trillion can afford a presidential jet but not nigeria the poverty capital of the world even britain the world s 5th richest economy does not have an aircraft dedicated solely for the exclusive use of the prime minister a much poorer country like nigeria has no business maintaining a presidential fleet at a whopping cost of n8 5bn to the taxpayer corruption continues to plague nigeria s budget at both federal and state tiers of government the n10 million monthly upkeep allowance legislated for ex governors of zamfara state thankfully now repealed epitomises the callousness of corruption in nigeria a poor state like zamfara was paying its ex governors more than twice the salary of the british prime minister a country that gave 320 million in aid to nigeria in 2017 how ironic the ruling elite have simply legitimised kleptocracy in nigeria appropriating more and more of the little resources nigeria has to themselves in salaries and obscene allowances through the budget process corruption in nigeria is ubiquitous and pervades the whole budgetary process from the formulation of mda budgets to the approval and oversight of the budget by the national assembly all the budget stages are riddled with corruption stifling much needed development as a country nigeria could be doing much better the nigerian entrepreneurial spirit is thriving wherever nigerians are based whether in the usa the uk south africa and nearer home in ghana nigerian businesses are creating jobs and making a huge impact on the gdps of their host countries the problem in nigeria is simply government and its agencies we have a commercial banking sector for instance that has been given a free hand by the central bank to fleece nigerians under the guise of recovering cost charging customers for every transaction making huge profits from non interest income in other climes banks survive primarily from interest income and from investing in the real economy through loans to businesses and individuals advertisement notwithstanding the challenges facing the country the star performer in buhari s administration these five years has been the nigerian customs service under the leadership of hameed ali income from customs has trebled from n59 billion in 2015 to n182 billion in 2018 providing the country with much needed revenue to address the enormous social and economic challenges facing the country the economy needs to grow by double digits for many years the projected real gdp growth of 2 9 per cent for 2020 falls far short moving the country forward would require a radical change in the way budgets are currently determined and performance monitored it would require sacrifice and commitment on the part of the executive and the leadership of the national assembly to put nigeria first before self interest the rich must be made to pay their fair share of taxes with debt taking up

following signs of a thaw in us china trade tension speculation is building that south korea may slow its pace of monetary easing in step with the growing possibility of a global economic upturn though the world s top two economies face a bumpy road ahead their latest reconciliatory move is expected to ease uncertainties especially for asia s fourth largest economy which is highly dependent on trade after washington and beijing announced their phase one agreement friday to reduce some 160 billion worth of us tariffs on chinese products us treasury secretary steven mnuchin described the recent development as very good for global economic growth we expect the phase one deal will be fully executed in january and then we get to phase two he said saturday at the doha forum in qatar with the us and china accounting for 35 5 percent of total trade as of last year korea has suffered a heavy blow from the prolonged trade tension between the two countries according to the bank of korea and korea customs service korea s accumulated export volume as of end november came to 496 7 billion down 10 7 percent from a year earlier while the bok assessed that the us china factor has dragged down korea s gross domestic product growth by 0 4 percentage point this year the korea development institute predicted that washington s additional tariffs if they had been imposed would have further cut growth by 0 34 percentage point amid the continued downward pressure on the economy the bok has cut the country s key interest rate twice this year once in july and then in october after the latest move which brought the figure to a record low of 1 25 percent the central bank said it would keep watch on the market waiting for the easing actions to have the intended effect but as key indicators such as exports and investment continued to dwindle throughout november speculation has grown that monetary policymakers might inevitably carry out another cut next year bank of korea gov lee ju yeol chairs the monetary policy board meeting on nov 29 when the bank froze the policy rate at the current record low of 1 25 percent yonhap bank of korea gov lee ju yeol chairs the monetary policy board meeting on nov 29 when the bank froze the policy rate at the current record low of 1 25 percent yonhap

photo brendan smialowski afp via getty images president trump got not one but two wins on trade last week a limited as of yet unsigned agreement with china that looks as if it might stem the acceleration of a costly trade war and a deal with democrats to ratify a new u s mexico canada trade deal this may matter quite a bit for trump and his political future but not all that much for the u s economy to understand why we have to go back to the coalition that put trump in office and looks set to keep him there through impeachment underneath the america first bluster grift and bigotry donald trump s presidency sits on a solid theory americans it goes who think they and their families were better off in a largely imagined past will keep voting to see the trappings of that past restored even if they don t see any financial benefit trump s trade deals are absolutely central to this project in this version of history wall street and global finance are irrelevant the u s economy is all about selling things that we make and the u s economy reigns as supreme as it did in the 1950s everyone needs to buy what we make in actual fact in 1960 the u s economy produced 60 percent of global income now it s less than 20 percent not because we shrunk but because everyone else grew while recovering from world war ii and colonial occupation manufacturing and agriculture together contribute just one quarter of u s income the rest of us are living off services whether we re lawyers brokers fast food workers or columnists so trump s team has the job of managing international trade in ways that give him a story to tell about selling things made by u s workers even as they understand perfectly well that what keeps the stock market and trump s donors afloat isn t that at all but an environment in which global financial deals produce maximum profit and minimum regulation sometimes trump s team seems to understand that the u s economy also needs to retain innovation and high tech firms other times like when they demonize the immigrants who have built many of those firms contributing the fabric of america along the way not so much the u s china deal if it is eventually signed gets at exactly zero of the underlying problems in the u s china trade relationship the ones that both decimated those old time manufacturing jobs and have chipped away at america s technological advantage it does nothing to change how china supports its industries in ways that are against international rules nor does china even promise to do better at not stealing technologies developed by u s companies and workers who does the deal help u s credit card companies who finally will be allowed to do business in china it helps major u s employers from apple to walmart not because of anything china promised to do but because trump will cancel or scale back tariffs that were already or would soon be making imports and some electronic components much more expensive for u s consumers and china promised to buy an unprecedented 50 billion worth of u s agricultural products over the next two years or at least that s what the white house says china s public statements haven t given a number and the two sides didn t release a shared text which is never a good sign assuming china spends something close to that amount it will be good news for hard hit u s farmers but it won t cover the total cost of the losses from two years of trump tariffs in addition to the bailouts the government has already paid so this deal is classic cynical trump point out a problem make it bigger and then claim victory over getting back to the starting place but with less money and credibility the usmca deal a successor to nafta is actually a little different but only because trump is still fighting with democrats and organized labor for the allegiance of manufacturing workers and their families and because the deal had to go through congress house speaker nancy pelosi had a big say in what it looked like so trump s team consulted closely with labor unions throughout the negotiations something president obama was criticized for skipping during the failed talks for the trans pacific partnership trade deal on top of that pelosi and her team used their influence to strengthen the requirement that mexico do more to protect its own workers making it less tempting for u s manufacturers to seek workers there so they can pay less amid lower safety standards and to get rid of some drug company language that would have kept prices higher longer on a class of medicines called biologics on this agreement too however trump didn t do anything like his campaign promise to tear up and totally renegotiate the foundations of the three country agreement you re unlikely to hear his supporters complaining too much about that though because markets and business were so afraid that s what would happen they were hugely relieved and pleased that the deal went through and market analysts think that should mean the economy will keep chugging along without a slowdown trump s success should yield some lessons for everyone it is possible to negotiate with your opponents at home and abroad and produce results having labor at the table is good policy and good politics the role of congress in representing the interests of all americans in how trade deals are done remains vital but a serious president would apply those lessons to the challenges standing between us and longterm economic health we should curb attacks on our intellectual property and sustain the u s advantage in cutting edge tech which involves attracting innovators from abroad as well as keeping their innovations we should reform our tax structures to keep profits and middle class jobs at home and we should be investing in our own infrastructure economy and education system without which no trade deal or partnership will enable us to compete a serious president would attack those problems instead of creating new distractions but the president is donald trump
sacramento gavin newsom the 40th governor of the state of california emerges from the door to his private office with a sigh sorry i m late says newsom 52 i was watching the impeachment hearings for newsom president donald trump is often unavoidable these days he and the president continue to be at loggerheads in fact newsom s position as leader of the so dubbed california resistance helped him get elected on nov 7 2018 but some critics contend the governor s first year in office has been diluted by this feud resulting in a lack of progress on huge issues a mushrooming homeless population astronomical housing prices a dangerous electrical grid that have led pundits to write eulogies for the age old california dream newsom is resolute the dream will live on in spite of trump one of the biggest stories that hasn t gotten full media attention is the assault by the president on the american people who happen to be residents of the largest state of our union newsom says in an exclusive year end interview with usa today but california is thriving despite him so far polls say most californians like the job newsom has done since being sworn in jan 7 with 44 approving and 32 disapproving according to a survey by the public policy institute of california but while newsom campaigned last fall on the enduring attraction of the mythic and potent california dream egalitarianism upward mobility natural beauty that postcard image has taken a hit homelessness is soaring 25 of the nation s 600 000 homeless live in california in san francisco alone apps have sprouted up to track human waste on sidewalks people with mental illnesses have attacked other residents and some companies most recently oracle have canceled downtown convention plans housing costs are driving away the middle class the median home price in california is 550 000 twice the national average according to zillow more than 28 190 people departed california in the second quarter of 2019 almost double 2017 s rate according to a regular migration report from real estate brokerage redfin and california s already prevalent wildfires now have an added menace this year s days long pacific gas electric power grid shutdowns wreaked havoc particularly on seniors and the poor along with fires they cost the state s economy 11 5 billion according to bank of the west chief economist scott anderson to newsom s constituents taking on trump is one task governing the state is another altogether he ran as a leader of the trump resistance and he s been all in there and gets full marks says thad kousser chair of the university of california san diego political science department and author of the power of american governors so the next step will be to really get a coherent policy agenda set and implemented california s duel with trump leading that resistance has been time consuming and trump is fighting back in ways that affect the state s policies over the past year trump has threatened to withhold federal aid for wildfire recovery on grounds that the state isn t managing its forests has suggested federal oversight is needed to fix the state s homelessness epidemic and has vowed to revoke the state s authority to set strict auto emissions standards most recently trump has ordered that federal lands in california be open to fracking style oil drilling just as newsom halted all fracking permits so that their ecological impact could be studied first meanwhile lawmakers in newsom s overwhelmingly democratic legislature passed a bill requiring trump to turn over his tax records if he wanted to be on the ballot in 2020 that chess move was overturned by the california supreme court but the jab landed california is a disgrace to our country trump told a cincinnati crowd days after the bill was passed in july some state lawmakers are concerned about newsom s slow pace of progress on the traditional parts of his job newsom has a democratic majority in the legislature and what has he done with it says assemblyman devon mathis a republican from the central valley agricultural town of visalia conditions have gotten worse and gorgeous cities like san francisco and los angeles are cesspools he says and many of us are trying to take care of our families praying to god we don t have a mishap and end up in the poverty line you re the governor you have the ability to do something not just talk newsom says he is well aware of the criticism and he asks for time we expect to be held accountable we expect people to demand more they want to see evidence of change he says all i can say is we got here 11 damn months ago and in the next few years if they don t see change they can make a change at the ballot box and they should if we don t produce real results although newsom doesn t offer a specific timeline he says this coming year should bring progress as a result of steps taken over the past year these include releasing 650 million to municipalities to address homelessness fining cities that push back against affordable housing initiatives and signing 22 wildfire related bills while increasing oversight over bankrupt utility pg e whose aging and faulty lines have sparked some of the deadly fires newsom also points out that in his first year he has signed numerous laws that are in keeping with california s progressive political track record these include a ban on facial recognition software in police body cameras granting sexual assault victims more time to sue and expanding gun seizure rules plan for 3 5 million new homes now a stretch housing newsom admits is perhaps his greatest challenge since it affects both the poor and the middle class the engine of the state s massive economy which totaled 3 trillion in 2018 during his inauguration speech newsom promised a marshall plan for affordable housing referencing u s aid to post world war ii europe he vowed to build 3 5 million new housing units by 2025 but in the first half of 2019 california cities approved 11 fewer residential building permits than the same period in 2018 according to a july report from the california department of finance he now calls the 3 5 million unit figure a stretch goal still newsom says the coming years should see growth in new affordable housing the housing issue which is so key to that california dream we have to hit that one head on newsom says so we have 4 5 billion from the private sector including 2 5 billion from tim cook at apple in the form of land for affordable housing first time homebuyer assistance and more he says we put in 1 75 billion in state money we re suing cities we also putting up money to help cities plan for housing we re looking at land use policies i hope in the next year or so we ll see movement but there s no silver bullet nothing happens overnight as mayor of the southern california surf hub of huntington beach erik peterson isn t so sure about newsom s housing strategy i m not a fan says peterson whose city newsom sued early in his tenure as governor for failing to permit enough new housing under him we re getting a more authoritarian sacramento says peterson the state says everyone will do what we say you need to rezone your suburban neighborhoods to be urban centers well we get pushback on that from our residents instead peterson says newsom should worry more about infrastructure and education which are falling apart and let s make california business friendly again if you have jobs people can afford the houses in the northern california town of chico mayor randall stone an affordable housing developer applauds newsom for being the first governor in recent memory to put money and emphasis on housing stone said he pulled newsom aside when the governor visited earlier in the year to check on the recovery of nearby paradise which was decimated by fire in 2018 stone told him the reason there s no building of affordable housing is we re disincentivized to blame stone says are property and sales tax rates that only go up 2 a year and do not keep pace with employee salaries and other municipal costs that often results in city halls being more likely to approve commercial building projects like shopping malls and auto dealerships because they bring in more tax revenue but i m not sure he can snap his fingers and fix that stone says they re longstanding systemic issues newsom cautions that if a not in my backyard attitude persists at a municipal level state initiated housing assistance is moot all this nimby ism society becomes how we behave he says this can t be i got mine why don t you focus that over there we ve got to own it we have to transfer that energy of angst toward a real follow through and i m just getting started newsom white house dreams some wonder where newsom wants to end up an entrepreneurial stint running his plumpjack winery company aside newsom has been in politics since becoming a san francisco city supervisor at 29 he became mayor at age 36 and lieutenant governor at 42 many california political observers consider newsom s presidential ambition to be one of the state s worst kept secrets both the bust of john f kennedy that sits on his desk as well as the photo of his smiling late father william newsom a state appeals court judge with former u s attorney general robert f kennedy seem to draw an invisible line between the photogenic governor and camelot but newsom consistently shoots down the speculation that he is preparing for a white house run later this decade honestly no interest he says indeed with its 40 million residents one in eight u s citizens calls california home newsom presides over nothing short of a nation state despite trump administration efforts california still sets its own climate change goals brokers its own deals with some of the world s leading automakers on tailpipe emissions and puts stakes in the ground when it comes to immigration policies such as its recent ban on privately run immigration detention centers our role is potent and powerful substantively so at this moment says newsom but while insisting that 1600 pennsylvania ave is not on his radar newsom said he feels confident about democratic chances to take the white house in 2020 we ve offered a lot of different flavors from progressive to conservative and we ll be well positioned to unite around somebody at a time when we need to do so to take out one of the worst presidents in american history he says newsom was supportive of longtime friend and sometime political rival sen kamala harris including planning an iowa trip to tout her candidacy before it was scratched when harris ended her campaign dec 3 of her withdrawal he says simply she had the burden of high expectations that she set herself after outperforming many people who have had far more years on the national stage whether it was watching harris soar then nosedive or simply tacitly acknowledging success in his first term as governor is key to any presidential run he says california has all his attention this is the office of the governor of california the fifth largest economy in the world he says looking around the room it s earl warren s office ronald reagan s office pat brown not just jerry brown it s the best job in the world newsom s bliss a recycling plant over the past 11 months newsom has kept up a busy travel schedule within the state often away from sacramento at least one or two days a week he has visited those displaced by fires up north comforted shooting victims down south and talked about water scarcity with farmers in the central valley what little free time he has back in the capital he dedicates to his wife filmmaker jennifer siebel newsom and their four kids all under 10 to unwind the governor says he likes to take his kids to the local fish hatchery and his favorite the recycling plant i m not sure what it is about seeing tens of thousands of things bouncing around but you get into that space and relax and zone out newsom says laughing but those who know him best suggest the governor relishes negotiating california s many vexing issues gavin s the happiest in the eye of the storm and that s where he s been all year long says nathan ballard founder of the press shop media relations firm and newsom s former mayoral press secretary he recalls the heat newsom happily took for allowing same sex couples to marry in 2004 a stand that anticipated a national movement the longtime friend and informal adviser says that while it s not in gavin s nature to relax ballard and a small group did manage to take newsom away from sacramento in october hauling him off to a rustic marin county restaurant to celebrate the governor s birthday that was fun but he knows that now it s time for him not just to survive a crisis but to make this state a better place to live says ballard and the proof will be on the streets simple as that newsom a self confessed policy wonk says he plans to get results over the coming years by learning everything he can about as many thorny california issues as possible governing is all about nuance the details he says simple program passing isn t problem solving when everyone else is running off to the next thing i have to dig into it all to be sure we can implement changes effectively i m accountable that approach has critics like mathis the visalia assemblymember shaking his head newsom seems like he s trying to solve every problem in the state by himself says mathis whose fellow state republican party officials recently endorsed long shot efforts to get newsom recalled as governor he needs to step up and start to delegate authority out and do so by stepping across the aisle governor swings at many pitches for anthony rendon who has been california s state assembly speaker since 2016 newsom stands apart from his predecessor brown who was uniquely not interested in many issues precisely because he cares about more newsom matter of factly says he is not capable of not trying to solve a problem so if today s critique is we re swinging at a lot of pitches absolutely that is fair criticism but he adds do i tell a senior citizen sorry i can t help with your prescription because my team says i just need to focus on a couple of things do you tell kids preschool can t be a priority because my communications staff think i should stay on wildfires do you tell wildfire folks listen we did some polling and it looks like this year it s got to be housing and homelessness newsom s eyebrows arch my point is he says when you look at those trade offs as governor you just know it all has to somehow be on the agenda one thing is certain with a 2020 to do list as high profile as newsom s start building new affordable housing shelter the homeless across the state fix a broken gas and electricity utility engage the republican president in battle it will be easy for voters here to keep score but what would he say to someone who has given up on california s golden dream and isn t willing to wait for newsom to polish it i would tell those folks i have a sensitivity to that they re not wrong the median price of a home is comically high in california he says veering off into details on his team s deep dives on housing solutions with city officials in vancouver and singapore but then newsom resets i m empathetic and sympathetic and it s disturbing to me he says but that said i feel for them you re missing the opportunities this state can provide we had a historic decade in venture capital investment a historic decade of job creation there is no trump economy without california s success this is florence in its golden age sure there are costs associated with that success yes but if we can balance those out boy the sky s the limit follow usa today national correspondent marco della cava marcodellacava
the 3 most important changes in the new nafta and why they matter president donald trump and democratic leaders agreed on a deal to pass a new trade agreement between the u s mexico and canada that will update nafta passing the new trade accord known as the u s mexico canada agreement would be a substantial win for both trump given it s one of his campaign promises and democrats who want to show they re legislating even as they prepare to impeach the president so how is the usmca different from the north american free trade agreement and why should you care although the final revised text of the usmca has not yet been released the deal as detailed in may contains numerous tweaks from its predecessor both big and small as an agriculture economist who studies trade i believe three changes are especially noteworthy please pass the butter since 1994 the u s and canada have dropped tariffs and other trade restrictions on most agricultural products but there were a few exceptions most notably dairy dairy was a particularly problematic sticking point in year long negotiations between the three countries the u s and canada both have long histories of protectionist policies such as subsidizing dairy farmers and setting import quotas on milk canadian tariffs on some products can be as high as 300 the new usmca begins to change that representing a small but important win for both countries especially the u s under the new accord canada will curb some of the ways it protects its dairy industry such as allowing more american milk butter cheese and other dairy products to enter canada duty free with reciprocal treatment for canadian dairy exports to the u s made in north america the new agreement also made big changes for auto manufacturers in hopes of ensuring more vehicles and parts are made in north america starting as early as 2020 to qualify for zero tariffs when crossing borders a car or truck must have 75 of its components manufactured in canada the u s or mexico up from 62 5 currently even more noteworthy negotiators agreed to a new requirement that 40 to 45 of a vehicle s components must be made by workers earning at least us 16 per hour which is about three times more than the average wage currently earned by mexican auto workers this change is huge particularly for low paid workers in mexico but it may lead to challenges over the enforcement of labor laws and increase the cost of cars made in all three countries keeping up with the times society has experienced significant technological changes since nafta was implemented in 1994 back then the internet was still in its infancy while smartphones and self driving cars were barely imaginable that s why modernization updating rules and standards to keep up with the times is a critical and positive update to the trade deal tying the north american continent together while nafta was the first trade treaty to include intellectual property protections the high pace of innovation has made modernization of its provisions imperative the new agreement includes stronger protections for patents and trademarks in areas such as biotech financial services and domain names all of which have advanced considerably over the past quarter century it also contains new provisions governing the expansion of digital trade and investment in innovative products and services separately negotiators agreed to update labor and environmental standards which were not central to the 1994 accord and are now typical in modern trade agreements examples include enforcing a minimum wage for autoworkers stricter environmental standards for mexican trucks and new rules on fishing to protect marine life apart from the changes there is one important thing about the original nafta that will stay thanks to the insistence of canada chapter 19 is the dispute settlement mechanism that allows countries to seek remedies for breaking the rules it s like trade court and makes it much easier to challenge another country s policies although mexico s senate ratified the usmca earlier this year the deal still needed approval from canada and the u s congress democrats and labor unions insisted on revisions to the text to address enforcement of labor and environmental provisions and intellectual property protection the newly revised text agreed to by trump and the democrats addresses these issues and is now ready for approval by all three countries all in all i believe the new nafta is definitely a modern and updated version of its important predecessor which the u s department of agriculture characterized as one of the most successful trade agreements in history this is an updated version of an article originally published on oct 2 2018 amanda m countryman associate professor of agricultural economics colorado state university this article is republished from the conversation under a creative commons license read the original article image reuters
donald trump speaks during a white house meeting with paraguay president mario abdo benítez december 13 2019 jabin botsford washington post facing impeachment this week donald trump cuts the losses from his trade war with china the white house said friday that it has reached a phase 1 agreement with beijing 23 months after donald trump imposed his first set of tariffs on china the european union india canada mexico and other countries the administration immediately tried to frame an amazing and historic deal but was soon checked by a counter narrative from china and by the reality of the agreement whose details have still not been made public beijing refused to confirm washington s announcement for several hours and then in a rare news conference focused on their supposed victory that meets the growing needs of the chinese people then news established that the deal is more of a pause in any escalation of trump s trade war rather than a settlement us and chinese officials said trump had suspended a sharp increase in tariffs due december 15 in return for china buying more us agricultural products and other goods and offering entry to some us financial firms limiting some but not all damage us officials said china will buy 32 billion of agricultural products surpassing a previous high of about 26 billion in 2012 trump has asserted that the purchases will probably hit 50 billion beijing is not confirming an amount although they have said they will increase imports the measure could save american farmers from collapse before trump s tariffs farm bankruptcies are up 24 from 2018 and farm debt is projected to reach a record high us shops and consumers will be spared the shock of trump s december tariffs which would have been slapped on products such as cellphones laptops and toys and september s duties on items such as clothing and shoes were halved from 15 to 7 5 apple was among the companies whose stock rose on friday it is unclear yet how much money will be recouped by the companies from trump s partial step back the tax foundation says the bill has been 88 billion so far with firms passing some of the cost to consumers through increased prices us financial institutions will be hoping to benefit from beijing finally allowing banks and credit card companies to enter china without a partnership a local chinese company jpmorgan chase had already started the preliminary work this summer to open in china but far from suffering defeat china gave up little in the phase 1 measures in mid 2018 after trump s initial tariffs beijing had offered the increase in purchases that it projected on friday the chinese did make a token commitment to penalties if it doesn t fulfil the agreement but the trump administration has to go through a lengthy process before imposing punitive duties and without any phase 2 deal many american businesses still endure heavy burdens trump still has tariffs on about 370 billion of chinese imports more than half the annual total to the us these include 25 duties on many parts used in manufacturing especially for automobiles the core issues between the us and china such as beijing s alleged theft of intellectual property are not addressed by the phase 1 arrangements a north american deal the white house spin is of a successful president getting business done despite impeachment on tuesday trump and house democrats announced agreement on a revised trade deal with mexico and canada the us mexico canada agreement updates the north american free trade agreement it was reached by the three countries in september 2018 amid trump s threat of punishing tariffs on north american partners but while the white house tried to portray a sweeping victory most of the revisions fulfilled canadian and mexican ambitions the white house and trump tried to frame tuesday s announcement as democrats giving way to their political skill the president wants victories i m not going to say he doesn t but the timing of it is far more about the democrats feeling pressured because a lot of these things the president negotiated long ago said marc short chief of staff to vice president mike pence but democrats noted that they obtained nearly every concession sought from the administration including strong enforcement mechanisms over provisions such as labor standards house speaker nancy pelosi told democratic legislators just before announcing the agreement we ate their lunch some republicans agreed one leadership aide explained the only reason pelosi moved on usmca is because she took lighthizer flipped him upside down and shook all the money out of him and destroyed him democrats won on substance trump won on the politics of usmca and that s because trump doesn t care about substance
the trade war between the us and china may never be settled experts fear even after the two sides agreed on an outline phase one deal economists and investors have been poring over the weekend s announcement which appeared to end a dispute that has roiled financial markets for 17 months according to washington s trade negotiator robert lighthizer china has agreed to buy up to 200bn in additional goods and services over the next two years on top of the amount it purchased in 2017 the agreement would also require china to make structural reforms and other changes to its economic and trade regime in the areas of intellectual property technology transfer agriculture financial services and currency and foreign exchange in exchange washington would roll back some tariffs on chinese goods which donald trump hailed as an amazing deal neither side offered any detail on what the chinese reforms might be leading to fears that the deal will fail to resolve the key underlying conflict between the two superpowers us democratic senator chris murphy called the agreement a total capitulation beijing confirmed that a deal had been made but its reaction was more muted this is the fifth time that a resolution to the us china trade dispute has been declared and pointedly official chinese responses did not contain a commitment to a specific target on new agricultural purchases that trump promised would hit 50bn also there are more rounds of talks to go before an official signing of this phase one deal beijing emphasised that the text needed to be legally vetted and translated into chinese suggesting that the terms were still not totally agreed upon a limited deal is recognition that a broad deal is impossible both realise that phase one is all they can get brad setser financial markets also betrayed unease that things could fall apart stocks on wall street and elsewhere were initially buoyed by the announcement but slipped back when details were not forthcoming the glacial progress on the so called phase one deal shows neither side wants to compromise and has exposed growing fault lines threatening what one prominent economist calls the deglobalisation of the world economy it is now not only a battle over trade and intellectual property but also one about the future of the rules based system of international trade and which economic model will prevail sharp us criticism of china over human rights in xinjiang and hong kong washington s fears about technology company huawei acting as a trojan horse in western economies plus ongoing military tensions in the south china sea have added volatile layers to the conflict mohamed el erian chief economic adviser to the insurance giant allianz said the mini deal announced on friday was expected by the markets and should be seen more as a temporary and reversible truce as opposed to a comprehensive resolution it would now come down to whether the two sides press play or rewind on the playbook that has dominated the global economy since the fall of the berlin wall 30 years ago it s no longer just about economic issues el erian said it speaks to a bigger question as to what follows this period where the pause button has been pressed on the multi decade process of economic and financial globalisation will the play button be pressed again as markets currently expect or instead rewind marking a period of secular deglobalisation both sides have talked up the benefits of the phase one deal since it was outlined in october the dow jones average on wall street has rallied more than 6 since then to multiple all time highs prompting similar gains around the world but despite trump agreeing to reduce the 15 tariffs on 160bn worth of goods due to start on sunday and halving the 15 tariffs on another 120bn it is still not clear if the agreement will lead to a second phase deal christopher balding an expert on the chinese economy and professor at fulbright university in vietnam also sounded a sceptical note because neither side had conceded very much ground i would still say one had to put the odds of this whole thing blowing up at 50 he said adding that the us rollback was minimal and easy to get out of if china did not fulfil its side of the bargain on agricultural purchases brad setser a former us treasury economist and now a fellow at the council of foreign relations thinktank in new york said an impasse had been reached amid a growing sense in the us that china does not want a deal within the existing framework china won t get a rollback of all tariffs and the us knows china is not going to moderate its economic model he says a limited deal is recognition that a broad deal is impossible both realise that phase one is all they can get but there is growing friction china is no longer seen as on a trajectory that favours the us it s not going to evolve to bring closer integration with the us and others from a chinese perspective there is growing anger at us criticism of internal matters such as treatment of the uighurs and hong kong in a speech hours before the announcement on friday china s minister of foreign affairs wang yi ignored the trade issue and excoriated the us for having seriously damaged the hard won mutual trust between the two countries his remarks indicate that the decoupling of the us and chinese economies was reaching the point of no return despite promising to open up china is not dismantling its state led economy and is using state resources to help companies expand globally through the belt and road initiative and

neighborhoods where few grocers offer healthy produce a cornucopia of subsidized fruits and vegetables for hundreds of families in san juan county where more than one in 10 residents is diabetic personalized classes to help participants reduce their risk of developing the disease by incorporating physical activity and healthy eating into their daily lives and in santa fe county where dozens of people die each year of drug overdoses a facility where anyone with a substance abuse disorder can walk in to get sober and then hopefully move on to treatment and recovery what connects these otherwise disparate public health initiatives and others around the state is that they are supported in part by millions of dollars from the state s nonprofit hospitals it s not simple generosity that motivates the largesse to maintain their tax exempt status nonprofit hospitals are required to invest in initiatives that respond to the needs of the population they serve so called community benefit tackling poor nutrition chronic illness and addiction are just a few examples of how hospitals can do this but there is no requirement for how much hospitals must spend to maintain their nonprofit status and in new mexico where community leaders seeking scarce public health funding are understandably grateful for what hospitals currently spend tax records indicate that some major nonprofit hospitals spend substantially less than similar institutions nationwide and much less than the tax exemptions they receive hospitals fall into three categories government run hospitals like those operated by the university of new mexico and the indian health service for profit hospitals like lovelace medical center and nonprofit hospitals like those run by presbyterian healthcare services and christus st vincent the state s nonprofit hospitals together rival the size of the private hospital sector tax exemptions for hospitals date back to the 19th century when many were affiliated with churches and primarily offered charity care to the poorest patients but times have changed and the business of medicine with it with the advent of medicare and medicaid in the 1960s the federal government took a growing role in health care reimbursing hospitals for care they might once have provided patients at a loss in more recent years passage of the affordable care act and the expansion of medicaid drove down even further the number of patients receiving charity care over those same years nonprofit hospitals have grown into some of the country s biggest businesses with billions of dollars of assets they don t look anything like they did when they were awarded tax exemption said john colombo a professor of law emeritus at the university of illinois at urbana who has testified about hospitals before congress but lawmakers have allowed them to retain their tax exempt status by expanding the types of expenditures that meet the community benefit requirement in addition to charity care hospitals can write off services they charge medicaid beneficiaries for which they aren t completely reimbursed training for hospital staff and direct spending to improve public health medicaid is a federal program that pays for healthcare of very low income people colombo criticized the practice hospitals want to throw in all sorts of stuff i find crazy they may also sponsor health fairs and outreach programs out of self interest he said as they are relatively inexpensive and make for good public relations you do that kind of stuff because it expands your patient base while new mexico doesn t have requirements about how much nonprofit hospitals must spend on community benefit to receive state and local tax breaks officials in other states have wrestled with their local hospitals over the matter a handful of states require nonprofit hospitals to meet a minimum amount of spending to benefit the community in utah and illinois hospital spending must meet or exceed the tax liability they avoid through their nonprofit status since 1993 texas has required hospitals to provide a minimum of 4 of net patient revenue as community benefit though research suggests that even as the law spurred less generous hospitals to increase their spending those that were spending over the threshold reduced their contributions leaving total community benefit unchanged in light of this oregon lawmakers who passed legislation this year will allow the oregon health authority to tailor a minimum threshold for each hospital massachusetts has taken a more collaborative approach rather than requiring hospitals spend a specific amount of community benefit the attorney general s office worked with hospitals and health plans across the state to update a set of voluntary guidelines in a departure from the irs definition of community benefits their guidelines encourage hospitals to invest in approaches targeting root causes of illness like housing instability unemployment and violence and to be transparent about the spending we ve been really successful here in massachusetts without legislative intervention said sandra wolitzky an assistant attorney general it just requires getting the right people at the table and coming up with reporting principles and an accountability framework in other places discord over the role nonprofit hospitals play has broken into all out warfare in new jersey the town of morristown sought to revoke the property tax exemption of a local hospital on the grounds it failed to operate as a nonprofit and in 2015 a tax judge ultimately decided in the town s favor spurring other cities in that state to seek property taxes from their own healthcare entities colombo agrees with the viewpoint that some hospitals may not actually operate as nonprofits my general view is that these modern hospitals are businesses not charities and we need to treat them as businesses nonprofit hospitals in new mexico have plenty of options for providing the community benefit their tax status requires the state s health ranks among the poorest in the country by a number of indicators injury substance use and mental illness are what sets new mexico s health status apart from that of the u s according to the latest state health department report which also highlighted the challenges created by the state s high poverty rate usda data in 2015 show that more than a quarter of new mexican census tracts are food deserts and one in four new mexico children don t have consistent access to sufficient food hospitals current community benefit spending reflects some of those priorities in partnership with bernalillo county public health authorities and community based organizations presbyterian health services helps fund the healthy here initiative which includes a mobile farmer s market that brings organic fruits and vegetables to albuquerque s international district and south valley neighborhoods during the summer months walking trails to promote physical activity and a wellness referral center to connect patients with free exercise classes public health leaders praise the program state rep micaela cadena d mesilla who is research director for the nonprofit young women united said she appreciates how presbyterian has created opportunities to exercise and eat healthy food rather than simply shaming unhealthy behaviors i think they are a fantastic example about how that can be done well in the northwest corner of the state san juan regional medical center reported spending 166 000 on diabetes prevention in 2017 more than a third of the hospital s direct spending on community benefit in addition to participating in local health fairs the hospital offers community members classes about diabetes that encourage them to incorporate healthy eating and exercise into their daily lives a hospital spokesperson estimated the program had served more than 1 200 people in the past year in may 2019 a nurse from the hospital also recorded a five minute public service announcement in navajo that ran all month on a local radio station one in three county residents is navajo a population with an elevated rate of the chronic illness in santa fe christus st vincent s has prioritized substance abuse between 2017 and 2019 it gave nearly 1 4 million to the santa fe recovery center the only residential treatment provider in the county that takes clients who can t afford to pay sylvia barela the recovery center s ceo since 2015 said the hospital provides about one third of the funding for the detox center and its support for wraparound services like food assistance transportation and housing is also crucial without the grant funding we wouldn t be able to provide those services barela said she nevertheless acknowledged that demand for the services vastly outstrips supply the recovery center s wait times run up to six weeks long we are able to take maybe one to two clients from the emergency department on a daily basis as opposed to maybe the 10 or 15 or 20 that are coming in how much is enough while hospitals investments in community health are widely heralded it s also clear they are insufficient to meet the state s needs but whether they should be doing more to maintain their tax exempt status is hard to answer they are required to document community benefit expenditures in their tax forms but the information is often so convoluted that even the hospitals themselves don t know how much they are spending the state and the hospitals need to find a way to make that information more available to folks said russel toal who spoke to nmid while deputy secretary of the human services department to make sure that hospitals are holding their own and also that they re not making excessive profits marsha willis is a senior policy analyst at the hilltop institute at the university of maryland baltimore county which monitors community benefit practices nationwide she said that judging how much hospitals should be spending is difficult the requirements for reporting are so bad at the national level hospitals can kind of do however they want but a comparison between the community benefit spending new mexico hospitals report on their tax returns and that of hospitals elsewhere suggests new mexico may be getting shortchanged nationwide overall community benefit spending by nonprofit hospitals in 2014 averaged 8 1 of operating expenses according to research published in the journal health affairs gary young director of the northeastern university center for health policy and healthcare research and the lead author of the study said there was a lot of variation among hospitals but that figure could be used as a benchmark a review of the last four years of available tax returns of new mexico s largest nonprofit hospitals shows that some have reported substantially lower levels of community benefit spending than is typical of hospitals nationwide in response the hospitals attributed the low figures to differences in accounting practices or changes in state and federal policy that are out of their hands presbyterian reported barely half the national average for 2014 2016 between 4 13 and 5 02 which young described as on the lower end of the national data sara rosenbaum chair of the health policy department at george washington university and another expert on this topic said the hospital s community benefit spending was unbelievably low clay holderman chief operating officer of presbyterian healthcare services attributed the hospital s low levels of spending in 2014 2016 to new mexico s expansion of medicaid under the affordable care act which reduced the uninsured population and with it charity care for which the hospital wasn t fully reimbursed a large share of presbyterian s overall community benefit spending is attributable to write offs for charges they don t recover in full which makes it sensitive to changes in the population s insurance coverage in 2017 when the state cut rates of reimbursement that doctors hospitals and dentists received for treating medicaid patients their community benefit spending rose to 8 24 holderman said presbyterian likes to keep its community benefit spending above 7 of operating revenue there s not a magic number but we do try to stay in line with what the needs of our community are he said we think we re doing a very good job christus st vincent gave even less community benefit as a share of operating expenses it reported 3 94 in 2014 and a lower share in each year since after reviewing the data ceo lilian montoya concluded that the figures were influenced significantly by internal accounting decisions for example she said her team had been incredibly conservative in what they claimed as subsidized health services and would be reevaluating that approach in future years writing off debt doesn t buy good health changes in insurance coverage should not affect some subcategories of community benefit spending such as direct expenditures on public health and grants to partner organizations like those supporting healthy here and the santa fe recovery center and willis of the hilltop institute said these types of spending are more important for public health than a hospital writing off debts for unreimbursed medical care if you re really trying to incentivize hospitals to do more to improve community health just covering charity care and medicaid shortfall doesn t really get you there she said nationwide hospitals report spending 0 5 of operating expenses on direct spending and grants to outside organizations according to young s research although hospitals in poor areas tend to report giving larger amounts of charity care likely because the populations they serve have less insurance coverage and worse health they report fewer direct expenditures and grants aimed at population health it becomes a sort of a vicious cycle there because those are communities where more investment in community health improvement and disease reduction would be really beneficial young said by the numbers taos holy cross hospital appeared to be surpassing the state s other hospitals by a large margin reporting nearly 2 of its operational expenses in the years 2014 2017 as direct expenditures on community health but upon inquiry chief financial officer steve rozenboom said that due to an accounting error the hospital had failed to report outside grants it had received to offset the cost of the programs and the hospital s own direct expenditures were considerably lower we don t know when we refile those particular returns what the result will be but it will be substantially reduced presbyterian reported over 2 7 million in direct expenditures and grants aimed at community health in 2017 but as a share of the hospital s 1 6 billion in operating expenses this amounted to 0 17 one third the national rate of 0 5 for these subcategories our goal is to significantly increase that in 2019 holderman said christus st vincent exceeded the national average averaging 0 77 of operating revenue over the past four years montoya pointed out that between 2014 17 the hospital doubled the grants it made to community organizations from 840 000 to 1 7 million but over that same time the hospital s direct expenditures on community health fell from 2 7 million to 846 000 so overall investments in population health that were attributable to the hospital declined what hospitals get in return another way to gauge hospitals level of community benefit spending is in comparison to the benefits they receive as nonprofit organizations while a complete accounting of their tax exemptions is not possible public records show they are worth tens of millions of dollars between them nonprofit hospitals hold tens of millions of dollars in real estate that are exempt from annual property taxes and their partial exemption from state gross receipts tax and total exemption from the local portion are estimated to be worth over 100 million a year nonprofit hospitals are exempt from both state and federal income tax the term nonprofit is something of a misnomer as they can and do accumulate profit which they may then plow back into employees salaries their executives are some of the best paid people in the state and new buildings and equipment presbyterian healthcare services for example reported net assets in 2016 of nearly 1 5 billion their properties are also generally tax exempt which means each year counties forgo property taxes that other landholders would have paid presbyterian s main hospital and its kaseman hospital both in albuquerque and its rust medical center in rio rancho had taxable values in 2018 of 30 million 15 million and 58 million respectively and are all fully exempt according to county assessors in santa fe christus st vincent s medical offices and parking lot alone are exempt from a taxable value of 6 3 million the county hasn t appraised the value of the hospital itself but said it could be around 100 million last july for the first time new mexico s nonprofit hospitals began paying the state gross receipt tax at 40 the rate paid by for profit businesses which should raise around 55 million in new revenue this fiscal year plus another 40 million from government and for profit hospitals my general view is that these modern hospitals are businesses not charities and we need to treat them as businesses professor of law emeritus john colombo university of illinois but the episode actually illustrates how hospitals wield their clout in new mexico in fact the tax increase was the hospitals idea because it was paired with a measure that infused the hospitals with additional resources the same week the measure passed the legislature also increased the rates that clinicians can bill medicaid for their services one of the legislature s leading tax experts rep jason harper r rio rancho said of the two measures they weren t directly coupled but it was understood that this would happen and that s why the hospital association supported it those clinical services which are jointly paid for by the state and federal government are worth 200 million to the hospitals this year richard anklam executive director of the new mexico tax research institute explained the idea is to increase the amount of money in the system available to the hospitals and its providers not the other way around and even after this year s changes in tax law the hospitals still do not pay any gross receipts taxes to municipalities state sen john arthur smith d deming who was involved in crafting the agreement in his role leading the senate finance committee said he was surprised albuquerque and santa fe didn t take the opportunity to advocate that hospitals pay them those taxes i really don t know why they didn t surface to say that just as nonprofit hospitals influence in the legislature is real so too is their significance for the health of new mexicans a simplified universe in which hospitals bear no special public obligations and reap no benefits from that status might be alluring but it isn t realistic those who want to improve community health must engage with them said gary young hospitals are central institutions in our healthcare system and if we re really going to do better in terms of keeping people well not just treating them when they get sick they need to be a part of that shift in paradigm ted alcorn is a writer whose work has

to engage local stakeholders guyana s oil and gas sector is one step closer to realisation with oil traders heading to the world s newest petrostate to engage local stakeholders and bid on the first oil cargoes this week according to a report from bloomberg at least half a dozen traders from houston geneva and london will land in guyana this weekend to bid on some of the first oil cargoes produced here the bloomberg report further said guyana is poised to produce more oil than neighbouring venezuela but the country has no experience in trading oil and is looking to learn the basics from its very first buyer just last week government sent a letter to refiners around the globe inviting them to bid for 3 million barrels of liza blend crude the light sweet oil it will start exporting next year the catch is that the buyer must take the unusual role of handling all operating and back office responsibilities related to exporting the crude according to a document seen by bloomberg on top of that the bids must be offered face to face in the country s capital of georgetown starting monday such a voyage is rare for traders who do most of their business on instant message platforms and by phone said bloomberg according to the report the liza field is scheduled to start production this month and will reach 120 000 barrels a day next year by 2025 it is expected to ramp up to 750 000 barrels daily at that rate guyana is set to produce as much oil as venezuela in five years guyana s output boom comes at a trying time for global oil markets the u s brazil and norway are all growing production even as the organisation of the petroleum exporting countries and its allies cut their own output in a bid to curb a global supply surplus guyana s liza blend has similar characteristics to grades produced by nigeria and angola and is also seen as an alternative to u s oil said bloomberg in its report local online media oil now had reported that fitch ratings one of the big three credit rating agencies in the us sees oil prices averaging 65 per barrel towards the end of 2019 and into 2020 around the time the south american country of guyana is expected to begin producing oil fitch ratings senior director dmitry marinchenko told reuters in an interview that a faltering global economy may start eating into demand for oil as early as this year pushing prices lower this is against the backdrop of brent crude guyana s likely benchmark currently trading at around 70 per barrel its highest so far for the year according to the report the rating agency expects global economic growth to slow to 2 8 per cent in 2019 2020 from 3 2 per cent in 2018 it sees 2019 oil prices averaging around 65 per barrel falling to 62 50 in 2020 and 57 50 by 2022 it reported that exxonmobil found more than 5 5 billion barrels of recoverable oil in guyana and as production draws close the us oil giants exxonmobil and its partners are conducting the final testing of systems and equipment onboard the liza destiny floating production storage and offloading fpso vessel in preparation for first oil still possible in december 2019 the risers have been hooked to the liza destiny so we re now in the commissioning phase which includes testing the equipment pressure testing and ensuring that everything is working smoothly public and government affairs adviser janelle persaud told reporters on thursday risers are pipes which connects an offshore fpso or a drilling rig to a sub sea system for production purposes they connect the flowlines to the surface facility and transport fluids exxonmobil and its partners are meticulous when it comes to safety and the go ahead for oil production will not be given until they are sure all that are needed are in place first oil will be determined when a formal decision is given for the go ahead and oil flows through the choke up to the surface which could take a matter of hours meanwhile guyana has already started to make preparations for the incoming revenue from the sector just last week finance minister winston jordan and the governor of the bank of guyana bog dr gobind ganga entered into an operational agreement for the management of the natural resource fund nrf the memorandum of understanding mou was handed over to the governor at the ministry of finance in accordance with sections 11 and 12 of the nrf act 2019 the bank of guyana has been mandated by the nrf act to ensure that the nrf is managed prudently other countries that have similar funds managed by their central banks include norway chile and botswana the inflows to the nrf will be in united states of america dollars which will be deposited in us bank accounts held by the bank of guyana the finance minister stated he continued it is important to note that most central banks and swfs manage reserves by holding them in foreign denominated currencies outside of their jurisdiction in preparation for its role as operational manager of the nrf the bank of guyana has begun building additional capacity supported by the world bank s reserves advisory and management programme ramp with whom an agreement was signed on october 1 2019
business news of sunday 15 december 2019 source theafricareport com africa s future is urban rising population growth and rapid urbanisation are both contributing to the rise of megacities on the continent by 2050 africa will be home to 10 megacities with 156 million residents similarly by 2050 africa s total population will double and the global share of african urban residents will grow to 20 2 up from 11 2 in 2010 because cities are centres of commercial activity 18 major african cities will have a combined spending power of 1 3 trillion over the next decade in fact megacities are expected to drive 15 of the world s gdp it is therefore no surprise that african investors and policymakers are gradually recognising the economic power of cities and ramping up investments in new city developments as these projects emerge here are three key trends that will shape the future of africa s new cities 1 private developers will largely fund new cities total investment in african new cities is almost 115bn with the majority of investment coming from the private sector over 75 of new cities across africa are privately funded private investors are acutely aware of the challenges facing cities such as poor infrastructure overcrowding and noise and air pollution by building new cities from scratch private developers can ensure the residents of their cities have access to good infrastructure low pollution and a safe environment by catering to the emerging african middle class new cities can serve as foundational blocks for economic development for private banks investment firms and multinational corporations new city developments are a lucrative investment lagos s eko atlantic dubbed africa s answer to dubai is a 6bn project funded by south energyx nigeria a lagos based business conglomerate privately funded city projects are found across the continent from mauritius s beau plan smart city to drc s kiswishi city to zambia s nkwashi city many of these cities are expected to host at least 200 000 residents these new private cities aren t just residential they often include industrial parks and commercial centres by catering to the emerging african middle class they can serve as foundational blocks for economic development 2 new cities are transforming into special economic zones sezs poor governance and corruption have stunted the growth of many african cities and made it difficult to attract needed foreign and domestic investment but special economic zones sezs are a promising solution across the globe countries most notably china have created sezs to generate wealth create jobs and attract investments serving as significant tools for economic development special economic zones can serve as significant tools for economic development because sezs typically operate under higher transparency rules and effective governing systems new city developers are looking to locate their cities in sezs sezs often include free trade zones industrial parks high tech parks tourist and recreational zones and business service parks in 2017 kenya s 18bn tatu city acquired sez status and was recently named a special planning area such a provision will improve governance by enabling developers to fast track city construction and cut encumbering bureaucratic processes roma park in zambia under construction is another city project with sez status and has already welcomed big businesses like mtn to its prime location right in city centre of lusaka many other new cities across the continent including kenya s konza technopolis nigeria s enyimba economic city senegal s diamniadio lake city mauritius s mon trésor and rwanda s kigali innovation city possess sez status these cities can offer businesses cost efficient trade facilities and serve as gateways to international markets 3 new city developments are tapping into the commercial value of higher education colleges and universities are economic engines not only do higher education institutions serve as research and technology centres they also produce a skilled and educated workforce that can grow businesses and develop industry clusters the united states with its numerous college towns has demonstrated how these cities support innovation and enhance regional economic development for example boston nicknamed america s college capital is home to over 346 000 students and 29 higher learning institutions including prestigious universities like harvard and mit over the years boston has cemented its position as a global hub for business medicine and research and continues to support hundreds of thousands of jobs in the area african countries need the enhanced productivity that cities bring to fuel economic growth african countries are now learning from america s success and are developing cities with higher learning institutions in mind in rwanda kigali innovation city kic is powering national economic growth through technology by attracting top tier universities and tech firms to the city kic has set ambitious economic goals to create over 50 000 jobs generate 150m in annual ict exports and attract more than 300m in fdi over the course of the project us based carnegie mellon university has already announced plans to locate its first african satellite campus to kic this move will undoubtedly facilitate collaboration and innovation between industries and academia in the region creating a strong talent pipeline for employers another example is zambia s nkwashi city designed especially for the knowledge economy nkwashi is set to host a 130 acre research focused us university an international school and nine primary and secondary schools these two examples of cities transitioning into university towns provide a model for other african countries to replicate as these trends continue they will support the development of africa s higher education landscape unleashing human capital in the process african countries need the enhanced productivity that cities bring to fuel economic growth translating africa s new cities into economic prosperity will require collaboration between african investors and policymakers to enable these cities to thrive additional investments in new city projects paired with well thought out urban policies are sure to play a fundamental role in fostering innovation job creation and wealth generation across the continent

the limited trade deal that the trump administration and beijing announced friday means americans will avoid a holiday tax increase on imported toys clothing and smartphones u s farmers can sell more soybeans and pork to china and american companies should face less pressure to hand over trade secrets to beijing but what the administration gained from the so called phase 1 deal that president donald trump celebrated falls well short of the demands the president issued when he launched a trade war against beijing 17 months ago further rounds of negotiations will be required to achieve a more significant agreement still friday s preliminary agreement managed to at least defuse a conflict that had put investors on edge and slowed economic growth entering an election year in which trump plans to campaign at least in part on america s prosperity under the agreement the trump administration dropped its plan to impose new tariffs on 160 billion of chinese imports beginning sunday a tax that would have likely led to higher prices on many consumer goods the administration also agreed to reduce its existing import taxes on about 112 billion in chinese goods from 15 to 7 5 in return u s trade representative robert lighthizer told reporters china agreed to buy 40 billion a year in u s farm products over two years even though u s agricultural exports to china have never topped 26 billion a year in addition beijing committed to ending a long standing practice of pressuring companies to hand over their technology as a condition of gaining access to the chinese market lighthizer said china also agreed to lift certain barriers to its market for such products as beef poultry seafood pet food and animal feed in all the u s expects a 200 billion boost in exports over two years as a result of the deal we expect the trade deficit to go down for sure lighthizer said adding that the agreement will likely be signed the first week in january and take effect 30 days later everything is written he said everything is completely finished yet the administration released no detailed paperwork on the agreement and it said the text was still being translated between chinese and english in the past the two sides had appeared to be close to firm agreements only to see negotiations fall apart at the same time the phase 1 agreement leaves some major issues unresolved notably complaints that beijing unfairly subsidizes its own companies to give them a competitive edge in world markets many trade analysts said the agreement amounted to a mixed bag this deal should go a long way in reversing the downward spiral in bilateral trade relations and increasing certainty for u s businesses said wendy cutler a former u s trade negotiator who is now vice president at the asia society policy institute but she cautioned it s unclear on how far the phase 1 agreement goes in addressing the key structural issues that brought the u s to the negotiating table 17 months ago other analysts were harsher with only limited concessions china has been able to preserve its mercantilist economic system and continue its discriminatory industrial policies at the expense of china s trading partners and the global economy said scott kennedy a china specialist at the center for strategic and international studies trump could reverse course and renew tariffs but beijing has bought itself a likely respite from the daily uncertainty for at least a few months and perhaps for the remainder of trump s current term trump had first announced a phase 1 deal back on oct 11 but negotiations continued for two more months the president who announced the latest agreement via twitter said that work on a follow up phase 2 agreement would begin immediately his announcement came minutes after the house judiciary committee approved impeachment charges of abuse of power and obstruction of congress leading the white house to argue that the president never stops working and continues to make successful deals that benefit this country in beijing officials said at a briefing that if the trump administration reduces its tariffs china will lower its trade penalties on american goods and also scrap plans for new tariffs sunday the world s two biggest economies are battling over the industries of the future and the way china does business an unorthodox mix of capitalism and state control the administration accuses china of cheating in its drive to develop such advanced technologies as driver less cars and artificial intelligence the administration alleges and independent analysts generally agree that china steals technology forces foreign companies to hand over trade secrets unfairly subsidizes its own firms and throws up bureaucratic hurdles for foreign rivals beijing rejects the accusations and contends that washington is simply trying to suppress a rising competitor in international trade since july 2018 the trump administration has imposed a series of trade sanctions on china sometimes changing or delaying planned tariff rates friday s announcement means the u s will still continue to impose 25 import taxes on 250 billion in chinese goods and will halve the tariffs on a separate 112 billion to 7 5 it will drop plans to target an additional 160 billion that step would have extended the tariffs to just about everything china sells the united states and would have hit consumer items such as toys and smartphones that have so far largely been spared beijing has retaliated by taxing 120 billion in u s exports including soybeans and other farm products that are vital to many of trump s supporters in rural america rob atkinson president of the information technology and innovation foundation said the agreement represents progress but said the united states must still comprehensively address china s rampant innovation mercantilist practices mary lovely a trade economist at the peterson institute for international economics said it s unlikely that friday s deal delivers enough benefits for the u s to outweigh the costs of the trade fight so far u s farmers lost billions of dollars in income companies paid billions in tariffs and in many cases shifted their supply chains and consumers saw some prices increase many of us are highly skeptical that the agreement will be enough to outweigh these other costs lovely said the u s didn t move the needle very much still the agreement should help smooth some of the uncertainty surrounding global trade lovely said we have a cease fire we have some roll back that is very significant she said we were kind of on a brink here and we saw the negotiators pull us back lighthizer said the phase 1 agreement addressed one of the key u s concerns ensuring that a deal can be enforced the trump administration and other critics say china has a long history of violating its promises friday s deal establishes a dispute resolution process if a complaint isn t resolved the aggrieved party can impose sanctions including tariffs a skeptic would say we ll see lighthizer said and that s probably a wise position to take but our expectation is that they ll keep their obligations and in any event they re enforceable repeated rounds of negotiations had failed to achieve a substantive deal the prolonged uncertainty over trump s trade policies curtailed u s business investment and likely held back economic growth many corporations have slowed or suspended investment plans until they know when how or even whether the trade standoff will end a far reaching agreement on china s technology policies will likely prove difficult it would require beijing to scale back its drive to become a global powerhouse in industrial high technology something it sees as a path to prosperity and international influence this deal would amount to a modest de escalation of trade hostilities but hardly resolves the fundamental trade and economic tensions that are dampening business sentiment and investment in both countries said eswar prasad an economist at cornell university and former head of the international monetary fund s china division efforts to acquire foreign technology are a theme that runs through chinese law and government security researchers have asserted that beijing operates a network of research institutes and business parks to turn stolen foreign technology into commercial products the trump administration has been seeking a way to enforce any significant trade agreement with china reflecting its contention that beijing has violated past promises one way to do is to retain some tariffs as leverage associated press
dow jones dax 30 ftse 100 forecasts the dow jones had a turbulent week gyrating wildly as trade headlines crossed the wires the dax 30 will enjoy the removal of risks in both the united states and the uk meanwhile the ftse 100 could finally enjoy relative stability after the uk general election revealed an outright conservative majority dow jones fundamental forecast outlook neutral the dow jones experienced considerable volatility last week as trade war headlines brexit related deadlines and monetary policy came to a head eventually a widespread removal of risk saw the dow jones close higher for the week despite friday s tumultuous session nevertheless statements from both president trump and various chinese officials revealed an apparent phase one us china trade deal on friday a prospect that was hinted at throughout the week and responsible for much of the gains while the trade deal is a welcome development for many traders some harbor doubt under the reported terms the united states has agreed to roll back tariffs on china in phases while cancelling the prospective december 15 duties on consumer goods in return china has supposedly agreed to increase agricultural purchases allow greater access to their financial services sector and expand intellectual property protection yet nobody has seen the deal in writing and it is rumored neither side has actually signed a document affirming the details further still the released terms are largely devoid of trackable metrics exceedingly vague language was used by chinese officials in their press conference where they declined to comment on specific figures consequently wall street expressed apprehension on friday as the shocking lack of detail became apparent to be sure the trade deal has had positive impact on the dow jones and stock sentiment in the short term but further clarity may be required to solidify recent gains and see them translate into longer term growth dow jones price chart hourly time frame november 2019 december 2019 chart 1 day trading the dow jones strategies tips trading signals thus it would be prudent to monitor risk exposure during this time as the two sides attempt to put pen to paper because as it stands an agreement where neither party has revealed specifics and nobody has actually signed amounts to very little with that in mind it looks as though trade headlines will continue to arrest control of the dow jones heading into the holidays as traders await the next steps dax 30 fundamental forecast outlook bullish in the meantime the dax 30 may look to capitalize on a relatively stable backdrop and a dovish european central bank alongside the dow jones the dax 30 enjoyed a boost from the possible trade deal while also receiving clarity on the brexit situation with the conservative party winning an outright majority in the december 12 general election coupled with christine lagarde at the head of the european central bank where she alluded to fiscal stimulus the dax 30 could employ newfound stability and growth prospects as an excuse to continue higher dax 30 price chart hourly time frame november 2019 december 2019 chart 2 how to trade dax 30 trading strategies and tips taking stock of the fundamental backdrop the dax 30 may be slated for a period of outperformance compared to the dow jones with the european central bank expressing a willingness to ease further whereas the fed is currently on pause looser monetary policy will look to offer one growth driver further germany is tied more closely to brexit than the us while also being less beholden to the us china trade war therefore the relative certainty on monetary policy and brexit against the potential unraveling of the trade deal could see the dax 30 close the gap to the dow jones in the coming weeks ftse 100 fundamental forecast outlook bullish shifting focus to the ftse 100 a landslide victory for prime minister boris johnson s conservative party saw the british pound spike in response as the likelihood of the uk leaving the eu rocketed higher the decisive victory will likely strengthen mr johnson s hand abroad at home and in subsequent trade talks to that end president trump took to twitter early friday morning promising to move quickly on talks for a new us uk trade deal with the january 31 2020 brexit deadline fast approaching it seems as though the uk has finally entered a position where an exit will take place while trade negotiations will likely drag on for months thereafter the terms of the initial exit will allow for uk businesses to expend capital against a relatively stable backdrop ftse 100 price chart hourly time frame november 2019 december 2019 chart 3 in turn the ftse 100 may enjoy a boost akin to the british pound s as business spending picks up

sacramento gavin newsom the 40th governor of the state of california emerges from the door to his private office with a sigh sorry i m late says newsom 52 i was watching the impeachment hearings for newsom president donald trump is often unavoidable these days he and the president continue to be at loggerheads in fact newsom s position as leader of the so dubbed california resistance helped him get elected on nov 7 2018 but some critics contend the governor s first year in office has been diluted by this feud resulting in a lack of progress on huge issues a mushrooming homeless population astronomical housing prices a dangerous electrical grid that have led pundits to write eulogies for the age old california dream newsom is resolute the dream will live on in spite of trump california gov gavin newsom 52 met recently with usa today to discuss his first year in office and how he has plans to tackle some of the state s most pressing problems from homelessness to a broken electricity grid one of the biggest stories that hasn t gotten full media attention is the assault by the president on the american people who happen to be residents of the largest state of our union newsom says in an exclusive year end interview with usa today but california is thriving despite him so far polls say most californians like the job newsom has done since being sworn in jan 7 with 44 approving and 32 disapproving according to a survey by the public policy institute of california but while newsom campaigned last fall on the enduring attraction of the mythic and potent california dream egalitarianism upward mobility natural beauty that postcard image has taken a hit homelessness is soaring 25 of the nation s 600 000 homeless live in california in san francisco alone apps have sprouted up to track human waste on sidewalks people with mental illnesses have attacked other residents and some companies most recently oracle have canceled downtown convention plans housing costs are driving away the middle class the median home price in california is 550 000 twice the national average according to zillow more than 28 190 people departed california in the second quarter of 2019 almost double 2017 s rate according to a regular migration report from real estate brokerage redfin and california s already prevalent wildfires now have an added menace this year s days long pacific gas electric power grid shutdowns wreaked havoc particularly on seniors and the poor along with fires they cost the state s economy 11 5 billion according to bank of the west chief economist scott anderson to newsom s constituents taking on trump is one task governing the state is another altogether he ran as a leader of the trump resistance and he s been all in there and gets full marks says thad kousser chair of the university of california san diego political science department and author of the power of american governors so the next step will be to really get a coherent policy agenda set and implemented california s duel with trump leading that resistance has been time consuming and trump is fighting back in ways that affect the state s policies over the past year trump has threatened to withhold federal aid for wildfire recovery on grounds that the state isn t managing its forests has suggested federal oversight is needed to fix the state s homelessness epidemic and has vowed to revoke the state s authority to set strict auto emissions standards most recently trump has ordered that federal lands in california be open to fracking style oil drilling just as newsom halted all fracking permits so that their ecological impact could be studied first meanwhile lawmakers in newsom s overwhelmingly democratic legislature passed a bill requiring trump to turn over his tax records if he wanted to be on the ballot in 2020 that chess move was overturned by the california supreme court but the jab landed california is a disgrace to our country trump told a cincinnati crowd days after the bill was passed in july president donald trump talks with california s then gov elect gavin newsom during a visit to a neighborhood destroyed by the wildfires in paradise california on nov 17 2018 the two have had an ongoing feud over issues such as forest management homelessness and immigration a duel that at times seems personal some state lawmakers are concerned about newsom s slow pace of progress on the traditional parts of his job newsom has a democratic majority in the legislature and what has he done with it says assemblyman devon mathis a republican from the central valley agricultural town of visalia conditions have gotten worse and gorgeous cities like san francisco and los angeles are cesspools he says and many of us are trying to take care of our families praying to god we don t have a mishap and end up in the poverty line you re the governor you have the ability to do something not just talk newsom says he is well aware of the criticism and he asks for time we expect to be held accountable we expect people to demand more they want to see evidence of change he says all i can say is we got here 11 damn months ago and in the next few years if they don t see change they can make a change at the ballot box and they should if we don t produce real results although newsom doesn t offer a specific timeline he says this coming year should bring progress as a result of steps taken over the past year these include releasing 650 million to municipalities to address homelessness fining cities that push back against affordable housing initiatives and signing 22 wildfire related bills while increasing oversight over bankrupt utility pg e whose aging and faulty lines have sparked some of the deadly fires newsom also points out that in his first year he has signed numerous laws that are in keeping with california s progressive political track record these include a ban on facial recognition software in police body cameras granting sexual assault victims more time to sue and expanding gun seizure rules plan for 3 5 million new homes now a stretch housing newsom admits is perhaps his greatest challenge since it affects both the poor and the middle class the engine of the state s massive economy which totaled 3 trillion in 2018 during his inauguration speech newsom promised a marshall plan for affordable housing referencing u s aid to post world war ii europe he vowed to build 3 5 million new housing units by 2025 but in the first half of 2019 california cities approved 11 fewer residential building permits than the same period in 2018 according to a july report from the california department of finance this recent santa barbara fire was determined to be caused by pacific gas electric power lines coming into contact and sparking during high winds california s fire season is beginning to extend year round as a result of climate change as well as housing developments that are in area indefensible by firefighters gov gavin newsom is appropriating millions from the current budget to reassess the state s approach to mitigating such disasters he now calls the 3 5 million unit figure a stretch goal still newsom says the coming years should see growth in new affordable housing the housing issue which is so key to that california dream we have to hit that one head on newsom says so we have 4 5 billion from the private sector including 2 5 billion from tim cook at apple in the form of land for affordable housing first time homebuyer assistance and more he says we put in 1 75 billion in state money we re suing cities we also putting up money to help cities plan for housing we re looking at land use policies i hope in the next year or so we ll see movement but there s no silver bullet nothing happens overnight as mayor of the southern california surf hub of huntington beach erik peterson isn t so sure about newsom s housing strategy i m not a fan says peterson whose city newsom sued early in his tenure as governor for failing to permit enough new housing under him we re getting a more authoritarian sacramento says peterson the state says everyone will do what we say you need to rezone your suburban neighborhoods to be urban centers well we get pushback on that from our residents instead peterson says newsom should worry more about infrastructure and education which are falling apart and let s make california business friendly again if you have jobs people can afford the houses in the northern california town of chico mayor randall stone an affordable housing developer applauds newsom for being the first governor in recent memory to put money and emphasis on housing stone said he pulled newsom aside when the governor visited earlier in the year to check on the recovery of nearby paradise which was decimated by fire in 2018 stone told him the reason there s no building of affordable housing is we re disincentivized to blame stone says are property and sales tax rates that only go up 2 a year and do not keep pace with employee salaries and other municipal costs that often results in city halls being more likely to approve commercial building projects like shopping malls and auto dealerships because they bring in more tax revenue but i m not sure he can snap his fingers and fix that stone says they re longstanding systemic issues newsom cautions that if a not in my backyard attitude persists at a municipal level state initiated housing assistance is moot all this nimby ism society becomes how we behave he says this can t be i got mine why don t you focus that over there we ve got to own it we have to transfer that energy of angst toward a real follow through and i m just getting started newsom white house dreams some wonder where newsom wants to end up an entrepreneurial stint running his plumpjack winery company aside newsom has been in politics since becoming a san francisco city supervisor at 29 he became mayor at age 36 and lieutenant governor at 42 many california political observers consider newsom s presidential ambition to be one of the state s worst kept secrets both the bust of john f kennedy that sits on his desk as well as the photo of his smiling late father william newsom a state appeals court judge with former u s attorney general robert f kennedy seem to draw an invisible line between the photogenic governor and camelot but newsom consistently shoots down the speculation that he is preparing for a white house run later this decade honestly no interest he says indeed with its 40 million residents one in eight u s citizens calls california home newsom presides over nothing short of a nation state despite trump administration efforts california still sets its own climate change goals brokers its own deals with some of the world s leading automakers on tailpipe emissions and puts stakes in the ground when it comes to immigration policies such as its recent ban on privately run immigration detention centers our role is potent and powerful substantively so at this moment says newsom but while insisting that 1600 pennsylvania ave is not on his radar newsom said he feels confident about democratic chances to take the white house in 2020 we ve offered a lot of different flavors from progressive to conservative and we ll be well positioned to unite around somebody at a time when we need to do so to take out one of the worst presidents in american history he says newsom was supportive of longtime friend and sometime political rival sen kamala harris including planning an iowa trip to tout her candidacy before it was scratched when harris ended her campaign dec 3 of her withdrawal he says simply she had the burden of high expectations that she set herself after outperforming many people who have had far more years on the national stage whether it was watching harris soar then nosedive or simply tacitly acknowledging success in his first term as governor is key to any presidential run he says california has all his attention this is the office of the governor of california the fifth largest economy in the world he says looking around the room it s earl warren s office ronald reagan s office pat brown not just jerry brown it s the best job in the world newsom s bliss a recycling plant over the past 11 months newsom has kept up a busy travel schedule within the state often away from sacramento at least one or two days a week he has visited those displaced by fires up north comforted shooting victims down south and talked about water scarcity with farmers in the central valley what little free time he has back in the capital he dedicates to his wife filmmaker jennifer siebel newsom and their four kids all under 10 to unwind the governor says he likes to take his kids to the local fish hatchery and his favorite the recycling plant california gov gavin newsom takes the oath of office from state supreme court chief justice tani gorre cantil sakauye as his wife jennifer siebel newsom and children look on during his inauguration monday jan 7 2019 in sacramento california newsom has been out of sacramento touring the state an average of a day or two a week since taking office which often leaves him little time for his family i m not sure what it is about seeing tens of thousands of things bouncing around but you get into that space and relax and zone out newsom says laughing but those who know him best suggest the governor relishes negotiating california s many vexing issues gavin s the happiest in the eye of the storm and that s where he s been all year long says nathan ballard founder of the press shop media relations firm and newsom s former mayoral press secretary he recalls the heat newsom happily took for allowing same sex couples to marry in 2004 a stand that anticipated a national movement the longtime friend and informal adviser says that while it s not in gavin s nature to relax ballard and a small group did manage to take newsom away from sacramento in october hauling him off to a rustic marin county restaurant to celebrate the governor s birthday that was fun but he knows that now it s time for him not just to survive a crisis but to make this state a better place to live says ballard and the proof will be on the streets simple as that newsom a self confessed policy wonk says he plans to get results over the coming years by learning everything he can about as many thorny california issues as possible governing is all about nuance the details he says simple program passing isn t problem solving when everyone else is running off to the next thing i have to dig into it all to be sure we can implement changes effectively i m accountable that approach has critics like mathis the visalia assemblymember shaking his head newsom seems like he s trying to solve every problem in the state by himself says mathis whose fellow state republican party officials recently endorsed long shot efforts to get newsom recalled as governor he needs to step up and start to delegate authority out and do so by stepping across the aisle governor swings at many pitches for anthony rendon who has been california s state assembly speaker since 2016 newsom stands apart from his predecessor brown who was uniquely not interested in many issues precisely because he cares about more newsom matter of factly says he is not capable of not trying to solve a problem so if today s critique is we re swinging at a lot of pitches absolutely that is fair criticism but he adds do i tell a senior citizen sorry i can t help with your prescription because my team says i just need to focus on a couple of things do you tell kids preschool can t be a priority because my communications staff think i should stay on wildfires do you tell wildfire folks listen we did some polling and it looks like this year it s got to be housing and homelessness california gov gavin newsom pictured here in his office in sacramento has been at the helm of state for 11 months he says he understands critics who say he is trying to tackle too many issues and hasn t gotten enough done to date but he counters that as governor he is obliged to listen to the issues of all constituents and vows that change on key issues will come during the rest of his first four year term newsom s eyebrows arch my point is he says when you look at those trade offs as governor you just know it all has to somehow be on the agenda one thing is certain with a 2020 to do list as high profile as newsom s start building new affordable housing shelter the homeless across the state fix a broken gas and electricity utility engage the republican president in battle it will be easy for voters here to keep score but what would he say to someone who has given up on california s golden dream and isn t willing to wait for newsom to polish it i would tell those folks i have a sensitivity to that they re not wrong the median price of a home is comically high in california he says veering off into details on his team s deep dives on housing solutions with city officials in vancouver and singapore but then newsom resets i m empathetic and sympathetic and it s disturbing to me he says but that said i feel for them you re missing the opportunities this state can provide we had a historic decade in venture capital investment a historic decade of job creation there is no trump economy without california s success this is florence in its golden age sure there are costs associated with that success yes but if we can balance those out boy the sky s the limit follow usa today national correspondent marco della cava marcodellacava this article originally appeared on usa today gavin newsom trump war with

thousands of retail stores are on track to close by the end of the year as consumers embrace online shopping but one company continues to rapidly expand its physical footprint and rake in profits year over year dollar general the goodlettsville tennessee based company announced its third quarter earnings on thursday revealing that it is on track to open 975 stores this year and 1 000 by the end of 2020 or 20 stores each week that s in addition to the more than 16 000 locations it already has which is more than mcdonald s in the u s and more than walmart globally we have a great group of individuals that work for this company that work hard every day to make sure we execute at a very very high level and that s what really gave us the notion to move a little faster here ceo todd vasos told investors thursday noting that sales rose 8 9 percent to nearly 7 billion over the last three months compared to the same time last year as retail companies such as macy s gap and walgreens slough off expensive store space dollar general has only added more locations the company s rapid expansion is only expected to continue as economic trends squeeze the middle class and economists warn of a looming recession the economy is continuing to create more of our core customer vasos told the wall street journal in 2017 we are putting stores today that perhaps five years ago were just on the cusp of probably not being our demographic and it has now turned to being our demographic dollar general was created out of the recession since the company went public in 2009 it has staked its claim in rural america most dollar general stores are located in towns with populations of fewer than 20 000 residents and miles away from grocery stores or big box retailers its core customer brings in less than 40 000 per household an estimated three quarters of u s residents live within five miles of a dollar general store in comparison just over one third of people live a five minute drive to a walmart according to the company research firm globaldata retail the stores are strictly no frills stocked with only the most popular consumer brands the company has also rolled out a line of private label products which allows it to control manufacturing and price it is able to offer such cheap prices in part because items are sold in smaller packaging which means that shoppers may be paying more per ounce compared to full size products dollar general s competitive edge goes beyond what it stocks on a shelf the company is also expanding its fleet of carrier trucks from 80 to 200 and plans to bring fedex drop off and collections to more than half of its stores by the end of 2020 there is also a dollar general app which enables customers to scan their items and check out on their phone reducing in store wait time and minimizing the number of workers required in some stores customers can also use the app to calculate the cost of their cart before they check out at the register these developments have wall street analysts and shareholders optimistic about how the company will grow even or perhaps especially in a recession when you have more challenging times value oriented retailers generally outperform the rest of retail robert ohmes an analyst with bank of america told nbc news depending on the type of recession it does outperform they understand their store model extremely well said simeon gutman an analyst with morgan stanley they know how much they need to pay in rent and they know their customer base really well the risk is clear and simple overbuilding where you can t compound that growth the way they have historically but they re well aware of that as income disparities widen more people in the u s choose dollar stores over grocers such as whole foods for their shopping grocery sales at dollar general and dollar tree neared 24 billion in 2018 compared with whole foods roughly 15 billion according to market data to meet that need dollar general rolled out fresh food departments and expects 650 stores to offer produce by the end of 2019 but the company s dominance in serving low income people in the grocery market has raised concerns among local officials and nonprofit community advocacy organizations such as the institute for local self reliance which argues that local grocers can t compete with dollar general as a wall street company we re seeing severely diminished small business lending from those same banks and investors said charlie thaxton a researcher with the organization access to capital is vital in order for small businesses to get off the ground this funding drought means that entrepreneurial local grocers who want to provide fresh foods to their community really don t even have a chance to compete some towns and cities have even adopted bans on stores such as dollar general arguing that these businesses create food deserts others such as kansas city oklahoma city and metro atlanta have introduced zoning changes that would limit the number of dollar stores in their towns new orleans city councilwoman cyndi nguyen who represents the district that includes the ninth ward ordered a planning commission study over the summer to investigate the impact of small box retail stores on the local economy there are a total of 36 small box dollar stores across the city and 12 in east new orleans which nguyen represents we re literally saturated she said my community my district is ready for big development and small box retailers but we want to make our economic area very diverse so it attracts different types of families because i want to continue to grow families yet even backlash from local officials has not stopped dollar general growth nationwide same store sales continue to increase every quarter they re becoming the rural convenience store said gutman
president donald trump s rhetoric towards china blows hot and cold depending on his daily mood but trump s overriding goal for 2020 is a glowing economy without that his re election prospects will take a dive the economy is far more important to trump s political future than impeachment yet the trade war s economic toll has largely offset stimulus from the 2017 tax cut the tax cut and jobs act of 2017 increased the federal budget deficit by almost us 800 billion annually and cut the corporate tax rate to 21 per cent in line with other advanced countries but unfortunately trade wars fostered business uncertainty worldwide and eliminated the investment boost that the lower tax rate would have generated trump can scold federal reserve chairman jerome powell but he cannot command negative interest rates what trump can do is dial back his trade wars accordingly the near term outlook is no escalation instead partial rollback of existing tariffs in exchange for assured us agricultural exports seems possible but trump s near term trade war tactics are a mere blip in the second cold war whether trump is re elected in 2020 or a democrat prevails makes little difference trump and his democratic rivals have all convinced themselves and a majority of americans that china is the threat of our era but there are differences of degree some us political leaders like republican and democratic senators marco rubio and charles schumer respectively characterise china as an existential threat others like republican senator rob portman favour targeted responses to specific trade and investment grievances henry kissinger s calming voice and warning that the united states and china have reached the foothills of a cold war find much less resonance in today s political environment during 2020 and beyond bilateral us china trade seems destined to stagnate or shrink but technology will be the lead weapon of decoupling a soft description of the second cold war the united states has already severely restricted us tech companies from selling to huawei not surprisingly huawei is already making smart phones without us components for a short period enhanced technological deprivation will slow china s industrial aspirations but this will not last instructive is the first soviet atomic bomb explosion in 1949 a mere four years after hiroshima to be sure soviet scientists were aided by spies at los alamos but china is no slouch when it comes to commercial espionage and chinese scientific and technological talent and capacities today are far better than those of the russians in the 1940s while the united states is busy decoupling china has mounted an economic charm offensive at a time when openness to trade has become too toxic for most world leaders to swallow president xi jinping has repeated a plea for china to welcome more imports speaking at the second china international import expo ciie hosted in shanghai over november 5 10 xi not only called for china to import more he extolled the world trade organization wto and likened globalisation to a mighty river unstoppable despite many shoals american sceptics will scoff at xi s speech but they should ask what other leader of a major economic power is calling for enhanced imports not president donald trump not chancellor angela merkel of germany not prime minister shinzo abe of japan the second cold war confronts asian leaders with challenges akin to those european leaders faced in the first cold war asian countries nearest china are clear targets of its geopolitical ambitions chinese influence travels alongside the belt and road initiative together with less obvious and less expensive covert measures but china is already a much bigger economic partner for asia than the united states unless china s ambitions take overt military shape or china s response to hong kong or the uyghurs becomes visibly bloody few asian countries are going to join washington s decoupling crusade trump has yet to take measures familiar in the arena of economic sanctions using secondary trade or financial restrictions to deter third countries from doing business with the adversary a looming question in 2021 and beyond is whether trump or his successor will take such measures to deter technologically advanced countries in asia and elsewhere from sharing technologies with chinese firms a taste of this option was the largely unsuccessful us diplomatic effort to deter european countries from buying huawei s wares stay tuned gary clyde hufbauer is a non resident senior fellow at the peterson institute of international economics piie this article is part of an eaf special feature series on 2019 in review and the year ahead
the perspective atlanta georgia posted december 15 2019 the diaspora dual citizenship bill is similar to apartheid south africa segregation policy historically liberia is a country of dual citizens with the exception of the original tribes who became citizens on january 4 1904 based on president arthur barclay s native plan according to the plan original inhabitants of the land had to apply for citizenship on the following grounds the willingness of applicants to qualify for liberian citizens by adopting the christian faith western living conditions and western standards of conduct dress and general appearance an african in effect would have to detach himself from his own customs by completely accepting the americo liberian set of values citizenship and voting rights might then follow yekutiel gershoni black colonialism the americo liberian scramble for the hinterland 1985 pp 37 38 president arthur barclay who established the native plan parents were immigrants from the west indies the fourteenth president of liberia arthur barclay was born on july 31 1854 in bridgetown barbados to anthony barclay and sara ann bourne barclay the barclays immigrated with their ten children to liberia in 1865 while arthur was then eleven years old the good guy role senator varney g sherman gave liberians in the diaspora hope with his double messaging saying one thing and meaning a totally different thing for example during the kicked off the debate on the act which called for amendment in the alien and nationality law and dual citizenship senator sherman as chairman of the senate committee on judiciary human rights described the laws as inhumane cruel and is contrary to the new terms of nationality concepts and practices he added most liberians who have taken united states citizenship did not do so out of hatred for their motherland liberia but due to circumstances that were beyond the reach of some these are his words he explained further due to the country s civil war many people including youth migrated to other countries in search of peace security economic opportunities and some had to obtain the citizenship of these countries in order to fully enjoy the peace security and economic opportunities for which they fled liberia for example if you are a citizen of the united states and you are a resident of a state to enter a university especially a university of that state the fee is 75 percent to 80 percent less than the person who is not an official resident or citizen so some of these young people assumed dual citizenship because that was the only way to go to school since they could not afford the high fees as non citizen sen sherman said why should we punish them by the law of the liberian citizenship which i submit is inhumane cruel and is contrary to the new terms and nationality concepts and practices because our constitution says that no law should be made which is inhumane which is cruel i don t think we are treating these people our fellow citizens some of whom are our children fairly sen sherman argued the bldg that massacred the dual citizen bill sen varney g sherman who proposed the bill according to the senator it is the generally accepted practice which is done in almost all of the west african countries except liberia research has shown that dual citizenship enhances social harmony and stimulates economic development through the participation of the dual citizen in the economy of the lesser developed country whose citizenship he or she holds based on senator sherman s earlier arguments i agreed when he said liberia should nullify these laws against dual citizenship and assume the modern term by giving dual citizenship to liberians but now i disagreed with the limitation he placed on diaspora dual citizens especially for not to be eligible to hold the office of the president vice president chief justice speaker senate pro tempore minister of justice minister of finance development planning among others the diaspora liberians dual citizenship proposal submitted by senator varney g sherman failed miserably to take into consideration liberia s history of immigration instead he proposed an apartheid style dual citizenship for diaspora liberians senator sherman s dual citizenship proposal is disingenuous at best tautology and can be described as apartheidor taxation without representation in other words liberians in the diaspora can become dual citizens but cannot enjoy full rights and privileges accorded citizens in the country of their birth even if they are the most qualified such citizenship reminds me of montgomery alabama where african americans were allowed to ride public transportation but must sit in a certain area the back of the bus even when there are empty seats in the front liberian citizenship is our birthrights therefore the liberian legislature cannot deny us these rights because they feared us we were born liberians therefore we are prepared to see to its restoration we take our strengths from the profound statement made by tony lawrence too many people are only willing to defend rights that are personally important to them it s selfish ignorance and it s exactly why totalitarian governments are able to get away with trampling on people freedom does not mean freedom just for the things i think i should be able to do freedom is for all of us if people will not speak up for other people s rights there will come a day when they will lose their own in support of lawrence s statement another unknown author wrote there are three kinds of people in the world those who make things happen those who watch things happen and those who wonder what happened we in the diaspora fall in the first category we make things happen it has been our position in this journey of life the october 2 2019 edition of the african star reads critics say the bill went too far in imposing harsh restrictions on dual citizens who are mostly in the diaspora from participating and directing the political affairs of their country vice president jewel taylor said during a press conference from her office inferred that the country cannot trust dual citizens who hold loyalty in other countries to occupy key positions in the liberian government she provided an example in which she indicated that dual citizens who are americans will leave liberia each year to file their taxes in the united states i find it difficult how any diaspora organization will accept senator sherman s apartheid bill why would anyone accept a bill that makes dual citizens ineligible to occupy the positions of president vice president speaker deputy speaker pro tempore of the senate minister of foreign affairs deputy minister of foreign affairs minister of justice deputy minister of justice minister of state for presidential affairs minister of finance deputy minister of finance head and deputy head of autonomous commissions and agencies as well as executive governor and deputy governor of the central bank of liberia however mr emmanuel s wettee chairman of the conference for dual citizenship told the african star on sunday september 1 2019 that he welcomes the bill because it represents an important start he explained that his conference of liberians for dual citizenship feels that they have worked hard to reach this point he stressed that those who disagree with the current bill should start their advocacy what an insult but mr toto former national chairman of ulaa told the african star on sunday september 1 2019 that the bill went too far with the limitations it imposed on dual citizens he added that the new bill is designed to protect the interests of the liberian legislators who view diaspora liberians as a threat to their power mr toto stressed that when the legislature passed the bill and the president signs it in its current form we will campaign to have the dual citizenship amendment defeated in a referendum according to the african star mr dahn dennis president of the united nimba citizen council unicco asserted that the bill is worthless and does not measure to a good work product to unite the diaspora community to support liberia s recovery the bill is discriminatory and seeks to further divide liberians who are supposed to rally their efforts to improve the living standards of the liberian people it is unfortunate for our country to deny its citizens participation in the governance of their country proponents of dual citizenship contend that the automatic loss of citizenship violates due process rights as provided for by the 1985 liberian constitution and negates the factors that created the diaspora liberian population the dual citizenship arguments reached the supreme court of liberia in the case alvin teage jalloh versus government of liberia jalloh a dual citizen who was born in liberia and acquired u s citizenship filed a petition with the west african nation s supreme court to declare chapter 22 sections 22 1 and 22 2 loss of citizenship of the 1974 alien and nationality laws of liberia unconstitutional jalloh argued that chapter iv article 28 of the 1985 constitution of liberia indicates that no citizen of the republic of liberia shall be deprived of citizenship or nationality except as provided by law and no person shall be denied the right to change citizenship or nationality this writer applauds attorney alvin teage jalloh for his tireless advocacy on behalf of diaspora liberians thomas jefferson one of the founding fathers of american reminds us that when the people fear their government there is tyranny when the government fears the people there is liberty unrestricted dual citizenship for diaspora liberians is good for example the world bank s report of 2012 relevant to global remittances pointed out that liberians in the diaspora out beat per gdp other africans living abroad by remitting 378 million in 2012 an increase of 18 million from 2011 remittance of 360 million a more than 31 of global remittances and third of liberia s gdp in 2012 the new dispensation 6 february 2013 in addition the usd explorer also provided its statistical information relevant to the remittances received by liberia during the period of 2011 through 2015 liberia accordingly received 360 million in 2011 516 million in 2012 383 million in 2013 495 million in 2014 and 693 million in 2015 as remittances from other countries these statistics demonstrate and show that liberia as a nation has benefited economically from its nationals in the diaspora the august 11 2019 edition of globe afrique states there are several individuals in several governments in africa that hold u s nationality while serving in the legislature and policy oriented appointed positions countries where many such individuals are found include but limited to nigeria kenya liberia sierra leone senegal ghana the gambia zimbabwe benin the ivory coast and cameroon in a strongly worded reaction to senator varney g sherman s dual citizen bill cllr frederick a b jayweh international affairs director of the us based africa center for law and human rights wrote that the bill bars native born liberians from holding the posts of president vice president chief justice speaker of the house of representatives minister of justice attorney general r l and president pro tempore among other provisions of his bill now before the senate is totally repugnant and patently un constitutional and unlawful at best the bill is suspect and when enacted into law and signed by the president of liberia his organization will immediately and forthwith challenge the bill in the supreme court of liberia for being wicked immoral unconstitutional and violation of human and peoples rights there is a zulu proverb that says kushayw edonsayo meaning when farmers plow the fields usually using four or six oxen they choose a lead cow the lead cow is in the front so she can make sure that the rest follow her and that everything is done just right the farmers watch her the most and if anything goes wrong she and not so much the rest always gets the whipping among many traditional african societies the ideals of mutuality and reciprocity were important aspects that shaped the daily social relations among them in all human societies it is rare not to have social tensions there were occasions when mistrust among members of a group or society emerged the zulu proverb kushayw edonsayo is intended to underscore the relations among people under circumstances of mistrust that later creates social tensions this proverb is used to capture the early symptoms of potential conflict when all norms regulating social behavior are thrown out of the window and the ideals of mutuality and coexistence ignored the proverb thus serves to show how adversaries create disharmony and tensions among individuals seeking to achieve the same ultimate results for their people the kushayw edonsayo proverb serves as a hint to the wise because when push comes to shove the so called advisors of president weah who are against dual citizenship for diaspora liberians will desert him to save their own necks because he is the leaders all of the blame will fall on his shoulders therefore president weah should be wise and learn from the observation made by mr kusi boafo head of public sector reforms in ghana on his recent visit to rwanda according to mr boafo i admit that as a public sector boss from ghana i drive a better car than their finance minister they ve more ambulances than we have ambulances even placed farms there s so much serenity in the country i saw a methodist church in a village shut down because the building looked weak the church was told to put it in good shape before they can get a permit to reopen they don t want to wait for it to collapse before they blame god a minister told me that in 2008 kagame gave loans to an equal number of men women to do business they d account after 5yrs the women had increased their profit in folds but most of the men didn t survive this explains why women receive 10 higher salaries in rwanda than men rwanda is a country that had one of the worse civil wars genocide to be exact another observation that mr boafo made that i feel those against granting full dual citizenship rights to diaspora liberians are missing saw a lot of big plantations like coffee tea and others to my amazement there were ambulances following farmers to the plantations in case there s an injury these small villages had hospitals with very young efficient working medics i was in awe i was stunned to learn that their minister of public sector reforms schooled at the univ of ghana biz sch a lot of them actually school in ghana their free education ends at the junior high school level the sec schools are only subsidized i was there with a 7 member delegation we stepped out to find food in fact there was no seller on the streets and everything was in order when president paul kagame was asked why he hasn t selected a successor his response to the question was the person who will succeed me will have to earn it president kagame s leadership example should be emulated by all african leaders especially liberia where the country congau divide is so divisive despite its ugly history i won t mind if the next president of liberia is either congau or country as much as the person is patriotic and sincere and we the citizens are honest to talk and write about our ugly history which will serve as a reminder that it will not be repeated to some degree i sympathized with those who since 2001 began advocating for the passage of liberians in the diaspora dual citizenship bill for them and their children i commend attorney alvin teage jalloh of the conference of liberians for dual citizenship in the u s and europe of which mr immanuel s wettee now chaired also the union of liberian associations in the americas ulaa the umbrella organization of liberians in the americas deserves credit for its undaunted support for liberians in the diaspora moreover the conference of liberians for dual citizenship in the u s and europe has worked tirelessly on the dual citizenship bill to become a reality to appeal to the all liberian conference on dual citizenship alcod to come up with a resolution at its december 6 7 2019 conference in silver spring maryland the resolution should ask president george manneh weah to support the diaspora dual citizenship bill because the conditions attached to the approved diaspora dual citizenship bill disenfranchised us many of us disagreed with individuals in the liberian diaspora who feel it is something to hold onto for now the sherman bill this justification reminds me of a story about a slave named toby and his master charlie toby had been master charlie s slave since he was a boy but when he became of age a young man he decided to obtain his freedom so he planned to ask his master to grant him his freedom one evening after he had done his work he said to his master master charlie having i been a good boy the master freedom through gradualism responded oh yes toby you been very obedient not like our neighbors slaves why are you asking me this question to which toby said master i want my freedom master charlie wasn t expecting such answer he was shocked his response to toby was boy give me some time for me and my family to think over it after several weeks master charlie called toby boy come here i want to talk to you about the thing you asked for some time ago my family and i are looking into it and we will give the answer after the cotton picking season toby was encouraged so he was happy to wait but when the day of the decision arrived master charlie said toby my faithful servant my family and i agreed to give you your freedom upon the following conditions we want you to work for us for three 3 more years five 5 days per week after you have done so we will consider giving you your freedom for good the freedom through gradualism proposed by master charlie and his family caused big palava in toby s family toby and ma jamima his wife agreed to the conditions they said to their children some freedom is better than no freedom in fact on those two 2 days saturday and sunday we free to rest and on sunday all of we will attend pastor leroy s first baptist heavenly bound church fbhbc but their children were not only opposed to the freedom on conditions they were in opposition to attending pastor leroy s all day church service the story about master charlie and toby is similar to the diaspora dual citizenship disenfranchised bill as liberians we must speak the truth even if it hurts the people we care about and admire we must be united and speak with one voice as we fight for our birthrights as citizens of liberia we refuse to accept second class citizenship in the country of our birth in short i am reminded of the profound statement made by ahmed sekou toure the late president of the republic of guinean i don t know what people mean when they call me the bad child of africa is it that they consider us unbending in the fight against imperialism against colonialism if so we can be proud to be called headstrong our wish is to remain a child of africa until death gwei feh kpeh the struggle continues about the

biodiesel blenders that create cleaner than diesel fuel from recycled cooking oil soybean oil and animal fats face an existential threat as they wait to see if congress will include reinstatement of a tax credit that lapsed two years ago the biodiesel blender credit expired at the end of 2017 companies that make the fuel and the truck plazas where it is sold both hope the credit will be reinstated but the biodiesel credit was not initially included as part of the dozen bills that make up a 1 4 trillion federal spending agreement reached dec 12 backers hope to get it added but call the chances slim the house and senate are under pressure to get an overall budget agreement before a temporary spending resolution expires dec 20 biodiesel production supports over 60 000 jobs across the united

biodiesel equipment and infrastructure and we think it is vital that the legislation be passed if not the biodiesel industry as we know it is going to disappear endangered industry there are signs that is already happening idling or curtailed production at 10 biodiesel plants in nine states has cost 265 jobs this year according to the national biodiesel board a trade association that represents producers feedstock suppliers and fuel distributors we expect more announcements in january if the tax credit is not renewed soon paul winters a national biodiesel board spokesman told freightwaves blended in amounts from 5 20 depending on the time of year biodiesel reduces smog and other pollutants from diesel powered engines the tax break puts its price on par with petroleum based diesel the idlings and curtailed production wiped out reductions of 2 35 million tons of co2 and 1 26 million pounds of particulate matter emissions according to the national biodiesel board biodiesel subsidizes the agriculture industry by creating a secondary use for soybean oil demand for 163 million bushels of soybeans generating 1 850 million pounds of soy oil that would have been used in biodiesel was lost this year because of lower production incentive driven the 1 per blended gallon credit encourages travel center operators like travel centers of america nasdaq ta love s travel stops and country stores and pilot flying j to blend more biodiesel absent government incentives nobody would sell biodiesel david fialkov vice president government affairs legislative and regulatory counsel for natso the association of truck stop and service plaza operators told freightwaves travel center operators are selling biodiesel at an artificially low price because they expect to recover the cost fialkov said ta said in its third quarter earnings report that restoring the credit would reduce its fuel cost of goods sold by approximately 35 million for 2018 and 28 9 million for the first nine months of 2019 ta projects it would take six to eight months to get the money while we remain optimistic that lawmakers will come up with a compromise before the end of the year to make businesses whole if they are unable to do so retailers and the entire biodiesel supply chain will need to re evaluate the long term viability of this policy said ta spokeswoman tina arundel broader legislation congress has never voted directly on the biodiesel tax credit it is part of broader legislation dozens if not hundreds of policy positions that become law by riding a bigger piece of legislation also are sidelined fialkov said skirmishes over funding of a border wall that president donald trump wants to prevent illegal immigration delayed passage of appropriations bills and led to the longest government shutdown in the nation s history temporary spending resolutions cover primarily basic needs and leave out tack ons like the blender credit that is fundamentally why the tax credit has not passed in the last couple of years fialkov said biodiesel blenders get some financial help through the federal renewable fuel standard rfs and states that offer blending incentives there is no rfs mandate to blend biodiesel that means it has to be cheaper at the pump to encourage use a renewable energy proposal released nov 19 included retroactive reinstatement of the blender credit for 2018 and would keep the 1 per blended gallon tax incentive through 2021 after that the incentive would gradually be reduced settling at 33 cents a gallon by 2024 multi state support for the first time legislators from states other than those that directly benefit from biodiesel support the tax incentive forty democrats signed a nov 6 letter to house speaker nancy pelosi and house ways and means chairman richard neal to push for the tax credit like the agreement reached nov 10 on a revised free trade agreement between the u s canada and mexico reinstatement of the biodiesel tax credit would give democratic legislators elected in 2018 in conservative districts an additional accomplishment to offset criticism of the house focus on impeaching trump it never got to the point where these guys had to get involved because usually the support of the ag community combined with flexibility on the part of leadership to put extraneous policy measures into an appropriations bill resulted in the credit coming through fialkov said
seventeen months and a long list of punitive tariffs after the u s china trade conflict began negotiators announced friday they have agreed to a phase one preliminary agreement that would provide significant but limited relief chinese officials and the office of u s trade representative robert lighthizer announced the pact if approved the first stage of the deal would include rollbacks on certain tariffs and purchases of u s agricultural products officials said u s president donald trump said a 25 percent tariff on 250 billion worth of chinese imports will remain in place but taxes on 120 billion worth of other goods will be cut to 7 5 percent the agreement however is preliminary and must still be approved by both governments chinese vice commerce minister wang shouwen also said the agreement will lift tariffs on 360 billion in goods sent to the united states on a phase by phase basis and that the united states agreed to exempt more chinese products a timetable was not specified friday s agreement also includes structural reforms and other changes to china s economic and trade regime in the areas of intellectual property technology transfer agriculture financial services and currency and foreign exchange lighthizer s office said as well as a commitment by beijing to make substantial buys of u s goods and services in the coming years a key element of the pact is a strong dispute resolution system that ensures prompt and effective implementation and enforcement officials said han jun china s vice minister of rural affairs did not specify the dollar amount of the agricultural goods china will buy but did say the next phase of negotiations will begin immediately instead of after the 2020 u s presidential election trump has indicated he could wait until after the vote next november to strike a deal a position that negatively influenced u s financial markets this month this article has been adapted from its original source
by colin morton vice president portfolio manager uk equity team franklin local asset management as widely expected the conservative party emerged victorious in the uk general election our colin morton anticipates uk equity markets will welcome the outcome but cautions that some uncertainties remain a conservative victory in the uk general election would seem to be the easiest result for equity markets to digest still our experience during past election periods is that markets tend to overreact in the immediate aftermath of a given result we re hoping that sort of knee jerk reaction will allow us to identify some potential opportunities over the coming weeks the market hates uncertainty and the general consensus among observers is that the conservative victory will preserve the status quo we re not expecting any increase in income tax or value added tax and corporate taxes should remain stable in light of this result we would anticipate a likely rally in the pound we think domestic uk stocks will likely do better than uk listed international names as sterling strength tends to weigh on export oriented multinational companies incidentally that s the trend we ve seen since prime minister boris johnson unexpectedly agreed to the withdrawal deal with the european union eu back in october an outperformance of the more domestically oriented stocks brexit uncertainty continues this latest election result still presents some uncertainty around the brexit resolution however in large part investors seem to have a better understanding of the implications of a tory win versus a labour victory or another hung parliament prior to the election johnson promised he d successfully conclude the free trade negotiations with the eu before the end of the year most people including us are skeptical that he can deliver on that some observers believe a strong conservative majority could lead johnson to play hardball with the eu as his government negotiates a trade deal in that regard a no deal brexit remains on the table a likely shadow on the market s medium term outlook however our view is that johnson s election campaign has centered on the withdrawal deal he negotiated so it would be hard for him then to finally submit to no deal at the end of the year there is a counterargument to those predicting his strong majority could presage a no deal brexit his strong numbers in parliament mean he is no longer reliant on support from those with more extreme views he may be able to seek a deadline extension without suffering too much damage to his political capital a robust uk economy the uk domestic economy appears to be in pretty good shape interest rates are very low average earnings are rising at 3 5 and inflation stands at 1 5 a rallying pound could exert downward pressure on inflation this conservative majority potentially makes increases in uk interest rates a bit more likely if the economy improves but we re not expecting large movements we do however expect government spending to grow at a faster rate than it has for several years which could provide a boost to the uk domestic economy in an environment of higher fiscal spending financial stocks could do quite well financials is quite a volatile sector and tends to be impacted negatively when people are bearish about equities generally by contrast we think that as the pound rallies and people are more optimistic they may be less keen on defensive names and we could see these types of companies underperform heightened interest from international investors according to our analysis many investors have been what we d consider to be underweight uk equities in light of the political uncertainty this election result might prompt a reversion to a more neutral position and we could potentially see substantial flows coming into uk equities from both international and domestic investors even though a rallying pound is likely to put some pressure on overseas earners at the same time we think a proportion of the potential assets coming back into the uk market could find its way into ftse 100 index companies because of the liquidity that index has historically offered 1 of course uk investors can t overlook what s going on internationally around two thirds of uk earnings come from overseas so international political machinations can have a significant impact on the uk market overall the recent escalation of trade tension not just between the united states and china but also encompassing other countries is causing lots of uncertainty eking out opportunities ahead of the uk election result we knew that there would be a knee jerk market reaction whatever the outcome remember markets over reacted in the aftermath of the eu referendum in 2016 and the market selloff then resulted in quite a few investment opportunities within a few days of the brexit vote we saw a chance to buy housebuilding stocks that had suffered badly because of an expectation that the uk economy would grind to a halt we didn t know precisely what would happen but we felt that the uk housebuilders were already undervalued and saw this event as an opportunity to buy with the conservative victory we d again consider using a knee jerk reaction as an opportunity to optimize our portfolios for example we think housebuilders could rally sharply on top of the recent rebound we saw in the months leading up to the election many housebuilders have net cash and pay an attractive dividend but a boost in uk domestic stocks could push prices up to a level where we might consider selling at attractive levels a brexit neutral approach throughout the political uncertainty that s dominated uk equity investing discourse since june 2016 we have tried to take a brexit neutral approach with our uk equity portfolios we expect this latest election result to prompt some dislocation in uk equity markets but over the coming weeks we will remain primed and ready to identify potential opportunities that may surface as a result what are the risks all investments involve risk including possible loss of principal the value of investments can go down as well as up and investors may not get back the full

ally bernie sanders warren backs a single payer medicare for all plan that would put an end to private insurance and enroll everyone on the government health care system her 20 5 trillion plan to provide every american with health care without raising taxes on the middle class has faced questions about whether the plan to pay for it is realistic it would tax employers 8 8 trillion about what they currently spend on health insurance double the wealth tax on billionaires add new taxes on stock trades and investment gains create new fees on big banks and increase taxes on companies that make more money abroad the plan also relies on 400 billion less spending on immigration and 800 billion in military spending cuts the plan also counts on 6 1 trillion in funding from states which would pay the federal government the amounts they spend now to cover insurance for state workers and low income residents on medicaid 2 wealth tax in addition to taxing income warren wants the federal government to start taxing the wealth accumulated by the nation s richest families warren would place an annual 2 tax or as she frequently refers to it two cents on family wealth more than 50 million she would charge an additional 1 for wealth of more than 1 billion such wealth would cover investments real estate holdings and other possessions raising questions about how the irs would implement the tax critics also have raised questions about whether such a policy would be constitutional ensuring an all but certain legal battle if warren managed to get the proposal passed into law 3 break up big tech warren wants to break up some of silicon valley s largest firms including amazon apple facebook and google her argument is that the companies have become monopolies and she would appoint federal regulators to undo some of the companies mergers such as google s acquisition of waze facebook s purchase of whatsapp and instagram and amazon s purchase of whole foods warren also would pass

expand photography by matt marcinkowski world wide technology business is booming in st louis even national publications are taking notice seek business capital recently ranked st louis as a top city for women entrepreneurs business insider credits the startup scene as one of the fastest growing in the country the penny hoarder and redfin named st louis as the top city for millennials and the most affordable and the council for community and economic research credits st louis as having one of the lowest costs of living among the nation s 20 largest metro areas today st louis is home to nine fortune 500 companies last year edward jones enterprise holdings and emerson all of which give back to the community like so many other st louis companies landed on forbes list of best employers for women and bunge and bayer are expanding their footprints here the city also has been long recognized as a leader in plant sciences with more than 1 000 plant science ph d s the largest concentration in the world and with construction underway on the 97 acre next nga west campus in north st louis the city is expected to become a leader in geospatial technology at the same time the cortex innovation community t rex and 39 north are creating programs and initiatives to fuel technology and innovation but all of this growth didn t happen overnight expand photography by kevin a roberts cortex innovation community start me up in the early 2000s the 200 acres where the cortex innovation community is now located between washington university s medical campus and saint louis university was largely desolate it was a tired industrial area with vacant lots says cortex president and ceo dennis lower it was really the hole in a donut of fairly decent infrastructure so a group of civic leaders gathered to create a road map their goal to develop an innovation district that would bring high paying tech jobs to the city generate new tax revenue and become the most inclusive innovation district in the country this has been a very intentional effort lower says we have been growing this now for almost two decades and now we are getting to the place where we are getting traction by 2018 a study showed that cortex companies and employees generated a direct impact of 1 billion when looking at the indirect impact that number jumped to more than 2 billion today there are approximately 6 000 employees in the district and that number s expected to more than double next year at inception there were 2 million square feet of office space in 2020 1 2 million square feet will be added the new construction will provide a hotel a 244 unit residential building and three parking garages the goal is to move to a 24 7 environment we want people to come early and stay late says lower a research building in conjunction with washington university school of medicine will provide a designated location for neuroscience labs neuroscience research is one of the strongest departments in the school of medicine explains lower and we re looking to leverage that with commercial tenants who want to be close to that research forging partnerships washington university chancellor andrew d martin moved away from st louis five years ago when he returned in 2018 he noticed a palpable change the energy around entrepreneurship innovation and the tech community changed remarkably he says it s this energy that s fueling growth across the region perhaps it s st louis manageable size or neighborly demeanor but one reason the business community is thriving is because the institutions are invested in each other there s a shared understanding that businesses are stronger if they work together one of our unique strengths are the partnerships between our public and private institutions says martin the business community the higher ed community and other leading nonprofits and government all work together to focus on growth in the region these partnerships can be found all across town ann marr vice president of global human resources at world wide technology says the company looks much different from when she first started twenty two years ago she recalls the company had about 130 employees and 120 million in revenue it s since grown to more than 6 000 employees spread across 11 global locations marr credits this growth to the constant evolution of technology and innovation as well as the thriving tech community here we have branded ourselves the silicon valley in st louis she says a lot of startups started here square and twitter growth requires more than space it requires programming and an environment where people feel supported so cortex opened venture café in 2014 as a way to connect innovators downtown t rex provides a technology incubator and an entrepreneur resource center as well as a co working space and 39 north is bringing together ag tech researchers and innovators across the region but all of this work doesn t happen in a bubble executives at world wide have led sessions to help newly established startups the company also offers a stem student forum for area high school students with the winning project receiving a grant it s so much fun just to see the creative ideas and the passion for technology says marr there are many instances in which genome technology and information technology work together we are not just one technology sector says lower we believe that innovation happens a lot of time where the tech sectors overlap these partnerships extend to universities the donald danforth plant science center for instance works with washington university slu and the university of missouri when you look at the quality of the universities in the region it s a vitally important resource says sam fiorello chief operating officer at the donald danforth plant science center and president of the center s affiliated bio research development growth park brdg park we have to continue working with these partners to figure out ways to help leverage them even more expand photography courtesy of the donald danforth plant science center donald danforth plant science center mapping growth in 2016 the national geospatial intelligence agency announced it would build its new western headquarters in north st louis the nga project is more than a new federal facility said mayor lyda krewson it is the opportunity to transform the neighborhoods around the site with businesses housing development and opportunities for residents the 1 75 billion headquarters is projected to employ 3 100 employees and help position st louis area as a global geospatial leader organizations are currently looking for ways to leverage that investment taking a collaborative approach similar to cortex a new initiative called geofutures aims to create a framework in which to drive investment in location intelligence technology the advisory committee composed of nearly 30 businesses and academic leaders meets monthly it s an opportunity that our area is leveraging for inclusive economic development that will be sustainable over the long run says t rex president and executive director patricia hagen the downtown tech incubator s entire fourth floor is being redesigned as geosaurus a resource for encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship in the geospatial sector we are focusing on geospatial because we have a lot of great partners in the field and we believe st louis can really stand out as a leader in geospatial expertise and innovation says hagen so much so that we want to be the international hub for innovation and entrepreneurship in the geospatial world at the same time the st louis metro area continues to grow as a global ag tech leader at the heart of the ag and food innovation ecosystem is the donald danforth plant science center the largest independent plant science research institution in the world with state of the art specialized facilities including research grade greenhouses and wet lab space the center s reputation attracts researchers from around the globe currently there are 320 full time employees from 24 countries talent is the real currency says fiorello it s relatively easy to get capital and access to great science but you have to find and recruit the talent and then get folks to stay here every year the danforth plant science center hosts an investor conference that brings together businesses venture capitalists and other funders for many of the companies in the nearby helix center this conference was their first time in st louis but that s just the beginning leaders at the danforth plant science center helix center brdg park bayer the st louis economic development partnership and more are partnering on a 600 acre space called 39 north the district will be geared toward science professionals lifestyles with mixed retail residential and office space connected by trails and green space having 39 north and what cortex is doing with the live work play is critical says fiorello location location location st louis affords a number of advantages over silicon valley and new york not all great technology happens on the east and west coast says marr you can access things easily and the cost of living is better hagen concurs it s becoming more and more expensive to be an entrepreneur and an innovator on the west and east coasts so the cost differential here is significant you can get office space downtown for around 18 per square foot there is no way you could replicate that on the east or west coast then there s the variety in high quality housing stock you can live in an urban neighborhood or on a farm and still work in the city says martin that diversity is something that the places we compete against don t offer st louis is also a comfortable place to live work and raise a family one feature has to do with its size we re not too big or too small says martin the metro region s large enough to make a significant impact but small enough that companies can benefit from partnerships and relationships with other institutions there s also something to be said for midwestern friendliness it s the people says hagen it s just wonderful to have a community of support here at the end of the day it all comes down to people martin agrees people are going to do their very best work in places which are livable newly revitalized neighborhoods are also attracting more professionals to the city talent doesn t want to come and live in the middle of nowhere says jason archer vice president of business development and workforce innovation at the st louis economic development partnership they want restaurants they want vibrancy they want energy st louis has long been known for its family friendly draws including affordable cultural attractions the recently renovated arch and kiener plaza as well as the st louis aquarium are adding to those options the restaurant scene s also evolved with such nationally recognized restaurants as vicia balkan treat box and cinder house such neighborhoods as the central west end midtown tower grove shaw and botanical heights are some of the hottest real estate markets in the entire region says lower as marr observes the city is trying to constantly reinvent itself to make sure it can attract and retain talent but also provide these things for people who already live here building community there is a true sense of community in st louis and with that a commitment to making sure everyone in the community has access to opportunities if we don t have inclusion then i think we ve failed says fiorello it s on us to continue to look for ways to increase our partnerships for example the danforth center partners with st louis community college to offer a technician training program it s turned out to be one of the great amenities that we offer to recruit and build companies says fiorello world wide technology also has several initiatives to ensure that the company has a diverse talent pool a new online resource stl works connects skilled job seekers with quality jobs spearheaded by the regional business council and st louis civic pride foundation the initiative focuses on health care manufacturing tech and the trades the st louis mosaic project a regional initiative through the st louis economic development partnership and world trade center works to support regional prosperity through immigration and innovation we want to become the most welcoming community for foreign born residents who want to come here and grow says archer we have to try to give everyone an opportunity to advance and be part of the fabric of our community it s an exciting time for economic development in the st louis region says st louis economic development partnership ceo rodney crim we are proud to work together with our economic development partners each playing a key role on the team to facilitate business growth in our region working together we are seeing some big wins
