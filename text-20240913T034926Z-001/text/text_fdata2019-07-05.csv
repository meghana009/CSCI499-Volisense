tweet the biggest recipient of chinese foreign direct investments in the philippines these days is the online or offshore gambling industry since duterte assumed the presidency real estate companies tours hotels and entertainment as well as services across metro manila cebu and the major cities have drawn the bulk of chinese fdis after wholesale and retail the fourth state visit to china of president rodrigo r duterte just two weeks ago is said to have yielded business deals worth a total of us 12 165 billion and a grant of one billion renminbi about us 148 5 million the duterte administration has also said that the deals alone could generate more than 21 000 jobs so far however there seems to be little enthusiasm from the filipino public over these supposedly laudable results from the president s latest china trip a possible reason for this is the public perception that the duterte administration has been complicit to chinese activities in the south china west philippine sea in exchange for deals such as these this perception in fact is already affecting the public s reaction to the increasing presence of chinese nationals in the country which is being met with wariness if not outright hostility and yet academics are in dispute on whether or not chinese foreign direct investment or fdi has actually increased under duterte my own research shows that fdi has surged since duterte took office but it also shows that chinese investment was still coming in during the presidency of benigno noynoy s aquino iii who had taken china to the international arbitration court at the hague on the matter of the south china west philippine sea the inflow of chinese fdi during aquino iii s term indicates that chinese firms are capable of overlooking beijing s differences with another government and put their money where they think it will be worth the effort in other words chinese firms act not with emotion but with practicality they do business for profit and to serve their own interests they do not necessarily bother themselves with the question of whether or not their presence or monies benefit the people of the country in which they invest in the real world that should actually be the lookout of the recipient nation s officials and business executives lower amounts for ph chinese foreign capital fdi development finance and other forms of finances in the philippines actually lags behind comparable low to high middle income states in southeast asia while the numbers could change in the next few years the philippines currently has one of the lowest amounts of chinese fdi and official development assistance o this lack of chinese foreign capital should be examined in the context of the philippines development strategy which has been on the upward trajectory in the past few years but has remained slowed stagnant and short sighted indeed the main comparative advantage of the country the business process outsourcing bpo sector is bound to decline due to the expansion of artificial intelligence and new innovations the sector cannot keep up with the number of fresh graduates that the philippines produces every year apart from the bpo sector the country has been kept afloat due to the reliance on exporting labor to generate foreign remittance inflows and bolster domestic consumption but this strategy encourages brain drain or outmigration and relies on servitude in other states in the meantime our middle income southeast asian neighbors have made it a crucial policy to actively tap chinese fdi culminating in developmental ventures that stress technology transfer value chain upgrading and skills transfer while the aquino iii administration was lauded for its economic reforms the development strategy during its term was short sighted and did not build up the state s real economic foundations in 2009 at the tail end of the arroyo era international capital markets experienced a huge influx of hot money due to the u s federal reserves quantitative easing in this context philippine national corporations or pncs capitalized on the influx of hot money in capital markets to fund their commercial ventures the aquino iii administration later relied on public private partnership ppp that empowered the pncs to spearhead philippine infrastructure construction but the pncs were overly cautious which resulted in institutional paralysis and painfully slow progress leading to the completion of only a few large scale projects aquino iii s ppp thus failed to lay down the foundations for a sustainable and competitive philippine economy when quantitative easing ended in 2015 much of the hot money placed in capital markets left in favor of the recovering u s stock market at the end of aquino iii s term numerous philippine cities with surging populations needed even more infrastructure services to support their quality of life infrastructure was also necessary to offset the cost of production which would have attracted more fdi into the country but aquino iii s overly cautious and pnc friendly strategy constrained the infrastructure buildup that the philippines needed to take the next step in economic development diversifying the economic portfolio sustaining long term growth and improving quality of life cannot occur without the massive infrastructure investment and fdi to generate jobs most of the philippines foreign direct investments come from japan the united states the netherlands and singapore china however has emerged to be one of the biggest sources of fdi in the world jumping from a few hundred million u s dollars to us 1 3 trillion in 2015 which necessitate our policymakers to attract chinese investments to bolster philippine development hong kong has also become the major offshore gateway for many chinese firms in 2015 hong kong s fdi stock amounted to us 1 4 trillion attracting fdi long term managerial control of assets in the host state via greenfield investments joint ventures and acquisition of controlling stakes is extremely necessary for developing countries since the 1980s countries across the globe have competed for fdi in order to achieve their developmental goals such as revenue generation employment and skills transfer the rise and rise of china money across philippine presidents 1990 to 2017 eye on profits still when it comes to chinese fdi however there have been growing concerns about its inherent differences from more normal usual fdi a popular notion is that that every chinese firm is fully control and funded by the chinese communist party ccp this is empirically misleading many chinese firms go to hong kong to create subsidiaries in order to acquire financing from international syndicate loans which usually come from western and global private institutions this goes back to how the chinese government tempers the amount of fdi that goes to the developing world while the conditions of the loans vary largely one common feature is the weight assigned to commercial considerations and financial returns these conditions make chinese fdi behave closer to western and conventional foreign investments the philippines china pivot came later compared to its southeast asian neighbors it began in 2016 shortly after duterte became president within months after his presidential inauguration he went on a trip to beijing and brought home an earmarked us 24 billion worth of fdi construction contracts and oda but many have argued that even after two whole years chinese investments have not yet reached these amounts notwithstanding the wrong expectations on both sides this issue brings about a crucial question how much is chinese fdi in the philippines in order to overcome data limitations i used the security exchange commission s firm registration to create a dataset on the annual number of new firms with chinese fdi which is defined as china money having more than 10 percent of shares figure 1 shows that the number of new firms with chinese fdi across six different philippine presidents from corazon aquino to rodrigo duterte chinese investments in the post marcos era initially began in the early 1990s the figure also shows though that the number of firms vastly increased from 2002 onward jumping from an average of 309 and 541 during the arroyo and aquino administrations respectively to 1 092 during the first two years of the duterte presidency in the early 1990s the dataset shows there were very few firms with chinese fdi until arroyo came into power this lack of investments however cannot be attributed to china s lack of willingness to invest after all in the early 1990s chinese oda increased in sub saharan africa while thailand vietnam and zambia were some of the first states to received substantial chinese fdi chinese fdi initially expanded in the natural resource industry enabling chinese state owned enterprises or soes to import minerals to supply china s export sector which sent manufactured goods to the west the uptick of chinese fdi during the arroyo administration however can be explained by arroyo s foreign policy and development strategies which wanted to bring the philippines closer to china and also china s go out policy or 走出去战略 which encouraged chinese enterprises to invest outside in the mid 2000s legal reforms in china allowed chinese soes and private enterprises to pursue mergers and acquisitions previously this had not been permitted by beijing more under aquino notably the dataset demonstrates that despite aquino iii s firm stance in the south china sea west philippine sea which had angered beijing the number of firms with chinese shareholders almost doubled those of gloria macapagal arroyo s time this only indicates that the disputes did little to interrupt the economic relationships between chinese and philippine business partners the increasing number of firms with chinese investments after 2010 or during the aquino iii presidency can be explained by the philippines economic growth after 2008 the financial crisis limited western manufacturing consumers and forced china to diversify its investment portfolio thus chinese investments after the financial crisis started to expand in information technology the entertainment industry and finance there were several variables that also mattered to this broader macroeconomic trend the falling rate of profitability and shift of the chinese economy from export manufacturing to consumption the steady growth of the philippine economy and arroyo and aquino iii s institutional reforms another way of putting it is that the economic relations and motivations between filipino and chinese citizens perceived improved philippine economy during the aquino iii administration and inertia of economic reforms since the 1990s accounted for the rise of chinese fdi nonetheless aquino iii s conflictual relations with china in the west philippine sea and his somewhat negative treatment of some chinese investments affected potential investments in truth one can argue that chinese investments increased not because but in spite of aquino s policies far bigger under duterte duterte s pivot to china though clearly led to the massive rise in the annual number of new firms with chinese investments as the data show the number of firms with chinese fdi increased by leaps and bounds under duterte jumping from around 500 to 600 during aquino to 1 257 in 2017 these increases across presidents can be seen in aggregate via the bangko sentral ng pilipinas dataset which shows that during the aquino iii administration 2010 q3 2016 q2 china s fdi inflows amounted to us 51 321 million while that of hong kong aggregated to us 1 180 75 million similarly within two years duterte s term 2016 q3 2018 q3 china s inflows reached us 211 million but those of hong kong aggregated to us 984 51 million while these amounts seem to disappoint china s inflows during the second year of the duterte administration already make up more than 83 percent of comparable inflows of the entire aquino iii administration and surpassed theentirety of chinese and hong kong investment received under president gloria arroyo us 828 million it is possible that chinese fdi would have been higher had aquino reconciled and negotiated with beijing by pursuing a middle ground solution with china about the dispute aquino may have been able to acquire chinese fdi at a higher rate without giving up the south china sea claim similarly however there would have been no need for duterte to give up the legal claim in practice but pursued a different solution chinese fdi would have been forthcoming anyway so long as beijing perceived the conditions on the ground as beneficial to it how good how bad but how beneficial have chinese monies been to the philippines to be clear about it chinese capital is available external capital apart from the conventional financial sources that can be targeted toward critical and strategic economic sectors that can raise the quality of life in the philippines for instance chinese loans and aid can supplement japanese capital which has been our largest source of financing for infrastructure apart from western commercial loans chinese foreign investors can put their money in critical sectors that conventional foreign investors see as too costly the biggest problem for foreign investors in the philippines is the lack of infrastructure and the high cost of basic goods which make labor and operations artificially expensive while aquino iii managed inflation well and the recent price increase can be attributed to duterte s build build build push compared to other middle income southeast asian states the average cost of basic goods such as food energy and yes internet service remains high while the quality can be low the philippines can use chinese loans and aid to invest in critical sectors build infrastructure for quality of life issues and keep up with its southeast asian neighbors but these fdis must be targeted toward carefully managed sectors that could generate jobs and instigate a multiplier effect across industries for loans development finance or aid these must be carefully managed and targeted toward infrastructure and connectivity oriented projects the case of kl jakarta my recent fieldwork in malaysia s pahang province and central sulawesi in indonesia reveals that both these countries have been able to strategically channel chinese fdi toward economically least developed provinces generating jobs for thousands and spurring economic growth in the regions in pahang the malaysia china kuantan industrial park mckip produces high carbon steel and h shaped steel the park has a 51 percent investment from the malaysian government and 49 percent from alliance steel m sdn bhd a subsidiary from of guangxi beibu gulf iron and steel co ltd from china strategically located in malaysia s eastern seas this park employs thousands in the area provides social services in the province and renders revenue to the government similarly the indonesia morowali industrial park imip houses multiple investors from australia korea china and indonesia china s tsingshan holding group and indonesia s pt bintang delapan the main investors created a consortium to mine nickel and process steel in the island the consortium purchases primary nickel ore from miners across indonesia and processes the ore within the park imip employs 30 000 local workers 3 000 temporary chinese expats and 10 000 contractual workers while the park could still be improved imip provides jobs to the greater morowali area and sulawesi as a whole and pays an enormous amount of revenue to the indonesia government the consortium has invested in free clinics which people across sulawesi can use built a vocational school to train the locals and improved infrastructure in the area inside the park there are eight mosques that workers can use during the day pointing to these two examples is not meant to glorify chinese investments for sure in sulawesi there are hundreds of artisanal small scale mining companies owned by western indonesian or indonesian chinese that focus on mineral extraction and disregard the socio environmental ramifications at the same time however for large scale mines there are chinese and non chinese companies in sulawesi that do not seem as socially oriented as imip while the chinese nationality of these firms point to some common processes such as access to capital markets and chinese technologies these examples provide proof that we cannot just subsume the organizational logic social impact and behavior of firms using nationality figure 2 in which regions of the philippines are chinese investments located ncr big cities get bulk so in the philippines where do firms with chinese fdi open their offices figure 2 illustrates the number of firms with chinese investments across regions in the philippines demonstrating that metro manila central luzon calabarzon central visayas and the davao del sur region received the highest shares the dataset shows that 57 percent or 4 445 of the 7 755 firms with chinese investments are in the national capital region or in the 16 cities of metro manila in these cities the three major central business districts cbds have the greatest number of firms with chinese fdi disaggregating the cbds further makati s ayala has 79 firms and taguig s bonifacio global city showcases 41 firms and ayala has 59 firms in pasig and mandaluyong area ortigas center has 268 and eastwood has 71 makati city as the nation s business capital has 426 of these firms in quezon city the largest city in the philippines in terms of land area and population size there are 645 firms and the binondo district the historical chinese neighborhood comprise 520 firms chinese investments outside metro manila are concentrated in regions where investment promotion agencies ipas exercise jurisdictional prerogative to invite verify and approve foreign investments foreign investors in the philippines do not need to primarily go through the department of trade and industry s dti board of investments boi which receives foreign investment applications across the country in non ipa administered zones the philippine economic zone authority peza manages all the special economic zones sezs that give economic incentives tax holidays and exemption from certain laws to firms with a substantial share of foreign investments there are several examples of ipas that stand out for chinese fdi the clark economic zone authority ceza and subic metropolitan authority sbma located in former u s military bases in central luzon have become major industrial zones for electronic chip assembly apart from these two smaller sezs across cavite and laguna have become major conduits of manufacturing or chip assembly factories for foreign capital figure 3 which sectors of the economy are drawing chinese money which sectors in the philippines have the greatest number of chinese firms figure 3 shows the number of firms with chinese investments across sectors the dataset shows that the top five sectors in terms of chinese investments are wholesale and retail business activities real estate light manufacturing and financial holdings while sezs in central luzon calabarzon and davao del sur comprise light manufacturing all of the other sectors typically operate outside of the sezs substantial amounts of chinese investments can be found in wholesale and retail and targeted toward the domestic market wholesale and retail are conventionally dominated by middle and upper middle class businessmen local firms with ties to domestic elites and small and medium enterprises that sell food items clothing motor vehicles and all sorts of necessities to filipinos business activities which consist of services and auxiliary activities are the second most targeted sector both sectors are also prime targets of espionage from security services since it is not difficult to set up fronts for these organizations gambling top drawer now since duterte assumed the presidency however real estate companies tours hotels and entertainment as well as services across metro manila cebu and major philippine cities have received the most amount of chinese fdi after wholesale and retail offshore gambling small hotels and resorts have reportedly been acquired to target the broader chinese consumption class and tourists this shows that apart from the major real estate companies of the sys ayalas and villars smaller business elites with the help of chinese investments also participate in the expansion of land housing and real estate many of the offshore gambling firms which started in the sezs have relocated to the cities and belong to these three categories the biggest recipient of chinese fdis in the philippines these days is the online or offshore gambling industry this sector however does not largely benefit filipinos and has spurred unintended socioeconomic spillovers still banning the sector would be too harsh because of the positive economic multiplier that the sector provides to the construction and real estate industry the better alternative seems to be to directly tax and regulate the offshore gambling sector some observers have said that chinese fdi and aid are debt inducing corrosive or simply dangerous yet these criticisms simply do not look at the statistical evidence that chinese fdi and aid have generated positive economic growth across the world other observers have said as well that we can simply rely on japan due to the low interest rates and due diligence of the japanese but the japanese agencies cannot fund everything because of limits on their end more importantly in some situations japanese projects are simply more expensive than the chinese japanese companies are also not as aggressive as chinese companies japan has been investing and sending aid to the philippines since the 1950s similarly the philippines has been actively and seeking japanese aid and yet results show that project completion and targeting have been slow resulting in the rollover of one project to another and that our economy has remained stagnant japanese investors are well connected and know how to play philippine politics as such they would not invest in financially and politically risky yet economically important sectors that could generate growth the chinese would do that but the key is to have a strong host state coalition that can renegotiate with china and investors many small m as there is no doubt that chinese fdis have been expanding in the philippines since the arroyo administration but these have been far smaller mergers and acquisitions that do not generate the same effects as a large scale investment a few deals involve bigger chinese investments in joint ventures with philippine national corporations which do not really generate new jobs for filipinos these investments may have contributed to growth but their real impact has been to allow philippine large and small capital to diversify their funders and invest elsewhere for chinese aid and financing duterte could have done better in two ways first duterte could have leveraged his newfound friendship with china to acquire better deals recent reports on the philippines contractual obligations on the approved deals such as commodity base payments and china driven arbitration have spurred intense domestic opposition against these projects comparatively these projects are not terrible per se rather they are comparable to many bri belt and road initiative a beijing brainchild that is supposed to improve relations with other countries through infrastructure projects and non bri chinese projects across the world but these issues could have been prevented had the duterte government bargained for better terms indonesian president joko widodo s jakarta bandung high speed railway project which has generous terms demonstrates that china can be flexible malaysia s kuantan and indonesia s morowali industrial parks in malaysia and indonesia have become the models for the newly planned mindanao steel plant and the chinese ayala industrial park in central luzon unlike mergers offshore gambling or real estate these plans appear to target productive sectors of the economy generate revenues and create jobs for filipinos the state and civil society however need to limit the possible socio environmental consequences of these projects second the duterte government could have used bri to fund new projects rather than choose ones that already had a slated budget at the start of duterte s term philippine funding for the kaliwa dam and the chico river pump finally became available yet the duterte government canceled the ppp financing of these projects opting to instead for bri financing which delayed the implementation process current events point to forthcoming major projects with china money even as the sec s firm registration data confirm that the number of chinese companies in the philippines has already surged during the first three years of rodrigo duterte s administration given these academics and the press should stop focusing on whether or not chinese foreign capital has increased in the philippines rather the focus should be on the developmental quality of the investments who benefits and who loses and the compliance of foreign capital to philippine national laws alvin camba is a china initiative fellow at the global development policy center and a ph d candidate at johns hopkins university in baltimore maryland he works on the political economy of chinese foreign capital and

lenders in three years read imf approves 6 billion loan for pakistan speaking at a hurriedly called news conference pm s adviser on finance and revenue dr abdul hafeez shaikh said the approval of 39 month reform programme by the imf executive board without opposition from any member would provide stability to pakistan the board has given us trust to prove ourselves good partners and deliver on reform promises he said he said this had improved the country s standing and other institutions had also started extending their financial support he said the asian development bank would disburse about 2 1bn out of 3 4bn agreed funds to pakistan this year and the world bank had also agreed to additional assistance purely for budgetary support discussions with the world bank were in progress for assistance only for the purpose of government expenditure he said giving a breakdown of 38bn expected financial support from lenders other than imf dr shaikh said about 8 7bn funds had been lined up against project loans 4 2bn for programme loans about 14bn of rollover loans and up to 8bn in commercial loans he did not go into details and sources of these loans fund s new boss hopes that pakistan s reforms programme could bring economic stability responding to a question he said pakistan s outflows for debt servicing amounted to 9 5bn during the last financial year and projected at 11 8bn during the current fiscal year the adviser said there had been different exaggerations and unfair comments about imf conditions while the government was in talks but it would also become clear as to what are the conditions when the imf releases full details of the programme he said the government decision to enter into the imf programme was a message to the world and other lending agencies that pakistan was serious and ready to prove its responsibility towards managing expenditures enhancing revenues and taking difficult decisions while protecting the vulnerable segments dr shaikh said there was also no condition or imf demand in the programme about the privatisation as it would become clear from the documents to be released by the fund instead pakistan has to develop a comprehensive programme to decide which loss making entities could be improved and run in the public sector which can be better run by the private sector and which require liquidation pakistan has said this programme will be completed by september 2020 but there was also a possibility that we finalise the restructuring plan before this target this is because these entities are a direct burden on the public finance and should be tackled at the earliest and if the pakistan state oil and pakistan international airlines are not being run in an efficient manner then this is not in the interest of our people the adviser said what should matter to all was that the imf was an international institution from whom pakistan could secure financial support and by taking benefit from this fiscal space set the stage for sustainable reforms in the long term interest of the people and the country and ensure how to learn lesson from the past and not to repeat mistakes he said the government had given independence to the state bank of pakistan so that it emerged as a strong institution like others in the world reading the imf programme dr shaikh said the imf would release about 1bn to pakistan by july 8 and roughly around 1bn every year envisaging an interest rate of about 3 per cent he said the government now wanted to build a platform on the basis of which the country could return to sustainable growth trajectory he said it was important for pakistan to tackle the energy sector bleeding as circular debt had gone beyond rs1 200bn he said build up of this debt was being addressed and had already been reduced from rs38bn per month to rs28bn and would be eliminated by the end of 2020 in a statement the imf s new boss david lipton hoped that pakistan s reforms programme could bring economic stability and catalyse international financial support for the country the programme aims to tackle longstanding policy and structural weaknesses restore macroeconomic stability catalyse significant international financial support and promote strong and sustainable growth in pakistan he said mr lipton an american economist was made the imf s interim leader on wednesday replacing christine lagarde who was nominated to head the european central bank pakistan is facing significant economic challenges on the back of large fiscal and financial needs and weak and unbalanced growth said mr lipton while explaining why did the imf board endorse the bailout package for pakistan noting that the adoption of the fy 2020 budget was an important initial step towards reforming the pakistani economy he said that a decisive fiscal consolidation was key to reducing the country s large public debt and building resilience achieving the fiscal objectives will require a multi year revenue mobilisation strategy to broaden the tax base and raise tax revenue in a well balanced and equitable manner he said it will also require a strong commitment by the provinces to support the consolidation effort and effective public financial management to improve the quality and efficiency of public spending the imf also released a brief assessment of the current economic situation in pakistan along with a summary of the imf programme for the country noting that the pakistani economy was at a critical juncture the legacy of misaligned economic policies including large fiscal deficits loose monetary policy and defence of an overvalued exchange rate fueled consumption and short term growth in recent years but steadily eroded macroeconomic buffers increased external and public debt and depleted international reserves the imf observed structural weaknesses remained largely unaddressed including a chronically weak tax administration a difficult business environment inefficient and loss making state owned enterprises amid a large informal economy it added the imf warned that without urgent policy action economic and financial stability could be at risk and growth prospects will be insufficient to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population mr lipton however assured in his statement that protecting the most vulnerable from the impact of adjustment policies will be an important priority of the imf programme this will be achieved by a significant increase in resources allocated to key social assistance programs supporting measures for the economic empowerment of women and investment in areas where poverty is high he said mr lipton said that a flexible market determined exchange rate and an adequately tight monetary policy will be key to correcting imbalances rebuilding reserves and keeping inflation low he also suggested strengthening the sbp s autonomy and eliminating central bank financing of the budget deficit which he said will enable the sbp to deliver on its mandate of price and financial stability mr lipton said that the government s ambitious agenda to strengthen institutions and remove impediments to growth will allow pakistan to reach its full economic potential he also underlined the need to address structural weaknesses in the energy sector and improving the governance of state owned enterprises to ensure efficiency and better services thus boosting economic activity improving the business climate strengthening efforts to fight corruption and enhancing the aml cft framework will create an enabling environment for private investment and job creation he added the imf chief noted that the strong financial support to the authorities policy efforts by pakistan s international partners was essential to meet the large external financing needs in the coming years and allow the programme to achieve its objectives the imf also released a summary of the programme its board approved on wednesday which includes a decisive fiscal consolidation to reduce public debt and build resilience starting with the adoption of an ambitious fy 2020 budget the adjustment will be supported by comprehensive efforts

most impacted by the trade war with china the next couple of weeks could be key for this group as industrial production numbers across the globe continue to decline thereâ s a sense that the fedâ s

dollar spurs rally the dollar continues to retreat towards 2019 lows which has been good news for emerging markets equities given that sovereign debt rates are already negative in many countries and have little room to fall further a tumbling fed funds rate could mean the dollar has further to fall in 2019 while a global recession would cause equities around the world to fall emerging markets

sectorâ s fundamentals remaining relatively attractive consumer staples xlp â a laggard no matter what defensive sectors continue to take a back seat thanks to the fedâ s loose money policy but consumer staples may be a laggard even if defense comes back into favor consumer companies will be impacted by trade policy and investors wishing to take a defensive tone may find domestic oriented utilities to be a better bet this group may be a sector to avoid whether itâ s a risk on or risk off market utilities xlu â the yield trade utilities have grown more highly correlated to treasuries

chart small caps have set lower highs in each of the past five short term peaks itâ s a very bearish sign when every short term spike in share prices is followed up by fresh lows at this point thereâ

stocks got a bump from the dollar this week but have failed to gain much traction on the s p 500 for most of 2019 many of the economic indicators coming out of the region suggest a recession is

tlh â volatility wanes bullish narrative intact itâ s not often that we see large caps return 17 and intermediate term treasuries return 7 and investment grade corporates return 11 in the same 6 month time frame but thatâ s exactly what weâ ve got in 2019 while lagging equities treasuries continue to reflect the declining economic environment a narrative that doesnâ t appear ready to go away

june spike to confirm the rally it didnâ t and now itâ s looking like lumber is trading more based on global economic weakness than the prospect of lower rates a big miss in may new home sales

move heading into the end of the first half of 2019 volume and breadth were also healthy as the s p 600 small cap index topped the s p 500 by more than 2 is this the sign of a robust move higher for equities not so fast part of the reason for small cap outperformance this week was due to the annual rebalancing of the russell indices a phenomenon which can result in many small company stocks trading many times their normal volumes and see temporary price spikes it was a nice week for a group that has spent much of the past year losing ground to large caps but this doesnâ t have the look of a sustainable fundamental based move european stocks led the way this past week as the ecb intimated that it was ready to pump additional stimulus into the region to help provide an economic boost german equities ewg not surprisingly received the biggest boost tacking on more than 1 the rally in the japanese yen is one of the bigger stories of the past month it just hit year to date highs from

traders to the sidelines the temporary trade truce between the u s and china should be welcome news for chinese equities mchi and those countries impacted by trade tensions of note was president trumpâ s willingness to back off the huawei ban at this point the desire to avoid recession will be deemed more important than an unwillingness to budge on trade demands this could be good news for emerging markets looking for a combination of easing trade tensions low interest rates and plenty of central bank stimulus to extend whatâ s been a solid bounce during the latter half of june macro observations yes negative rates can be ok in some circumstances as the s p 500 continues to trade near all time highs and the fed stands ready to slash the target fed funds rate multiple times over the next 12 months itâ s important to remember that what is happening in the united states is not happening around the world in fact itâ s happening almost nowhere else around the world investors may complain about the measly 2 yields being paid on most u s treasury maturities but the sovereign debt from many countries currently carry negative interest rates there is now more than 11 trillion in negative yielding government debt around the world accounting for roughly 30 of total debt issued the implications for the overwhelming presence of negative yielding debt are pretty clear the global economy is getting weaker investors are flocking to safe assets to protect their capital and are thereby driving rates lower and lower central banks are slashing their benchmark rates in order to make cash equivalents less attractive and motivate consumers to purchase and lend pushing interest rates all the way down to zero in these scenarios at least makes sense but negative yielding debt seems like a paradox why would investors put their money in a bank account or a bond that promises to use their cash for their own business purposes and charge them for the privilege in the process the answer is complicated but there are circumstances in which taking on negative yielding debt makes sense in rare circumstances it can even be a good thing and we may be seeing those very circumstances playing out in the european union right now the most common scenario in which negative rates might be warranted is when an economy slips into deflation where the inflation rate actually goes negative in a deflationary economy the prices of goods and services are declining and are indicative of low consumer demand this can lead to companies cutting production and laying off employees as more workers become unemployed and cut back on their personal spending companies may be forced to cut prices even further to stoke demand and this vicious circle results in a deflationary spiral that can be difficult to pull out of but interest rates must also be viewed in the context of the inflation rate while negative interest rates are less than ideal from an economic growth standpoint real purchasing power can still rise as long as interest rates remain ahead of inflation for example if a government bond yield is 0 5 but the countryâ s inflation rate is 1 real purchasing power is still increasing in a situation like this investors could feel that the safety of government debt despite its negative yield is worth more than the cost of losing money the other situation where accepting negative rates might be ok is more dire banks are threatening to become insolvent in many countries deposit insurance works similarly to how it does in the united states balances are protected up to a certain point for high net worth and institutional investors however this can become a problem if that insurance amount doesnâ t fully cover their total asset balance if theyâ re unable to sufficiently spread their exposure around shifting their assets out of an at risk bank and into negative yielding government debt may be the preferable option after all a 1 yield is a lot better than a 100 loss of principal bank insolvency risk is particularly high right now over in the eurozone european banks are especially reliant on interest income for profitability and negative rates are making these institutions exceptionally vulnerable the stock prices of banks such as barclays and credit suisse are down 40 from just a year and a half ago while deutsche bank and its 49 trillion in derivatives exposure is down 63 looking more and more like a house of cards waiting to topple for buyers of these bonds believing that the negative yield means that they will lose money on the investment recent history shows that this is not necessarily true as has been the case with u s treasuries low yielding bonds have posted decent returns because rates have managed to go even lower negative yielding government bonds have performed roughly on par with the bloomberg barclays global aggregate bond index a collection of government corporate and securitized bonds from around the world since the end of 2016 the 10 year german bund which is often used as the poster child for the negative yielding government debt crisis has seen its price rise from 100 at the beginning of the year to 105 60 as of thursdayâ s close a negative yield can be a burden to the total return of a government bond investment but itâ s also the price paid for safety in an uncertain economic environment make no mistake though negative yields are not a â goodâ thing with benchmark interest rates so low to begin with the ecbâ s overnight deposit rate is already at 0 4 it gives governments few resources with which to combat deflation and stagnant growth as i discussed in the sector view above european banks have struggled mightily compared to their better capitalized u s bank counterparts for most of the past two years if europe financial institution balance sheets continue to deteriorate as they have been lately negative sovereign debt interest rates could actually begin looking attractive conclusion the holiday shortened week will likely help temper any significant market volatility but fridayâ s release of june employment data should keep investors on their toes initial jobless claims rose unexpectedly last week and could add a new layer of interest to the report given all of the twists and turns itâ s been impossible to profit consistently from the trade war and this weekâ s g 20 truce announcement will be no different i expect the markets will initially react positively before settling in trying to figure out what comes next keep an eye on tech and emerging markets stocks as well as industrials for their reaction to the news the major narrative however remains central bank activity weâ re a month away from the july fed meeting in which just about every pundit expects at least a quarter point cut european and asian central banks are ready to move at the first sign of further global weakness attempts to keep asset prices inflated despite an economic slowdown further raise the risks of a potential sharp decline that iâ ve discussed several times over the past couple months
source imf welcomes monetary reforms the herald july 5 2019 business reporter the international monetary fund imf says the latest reforms announced by both the ministry of finance and economic development through si 142 of 2019 and the reserve bank of zimbabwe through exchange control directive ru102 2019 are welcome as they seek to address economic distortions that have impaired macroeconomic stability last week government introduced a raft of changes that saw the country finally abandoning the multicurrency regime that had been in place since 2009 through si 142 of 2019 government outlawed the use of any foreign currency in local transactions but still allowed the buying and selling of foreign currency on a willing buyer willing seller basis the zimbabwe dollar shall with effect from june 24 2019 be the sole legal tender in zimbabwe in all transactions reads si 142 the british pound united states dollar south african rand botswana pula and any other foreign currency whatsoever shall no longer be legal tender alongside the zimbabwe dollar in any transactions in zimbabwe commenting on the changes minister of finance and economic development professor mthuli ncube said what was happening in the market was that the market was self us dollarising it was uncontrollable and we felt that we needed to bring the situation under control quite clearly it became an untenable situation and it became necessary for government to move a lot faster and introduce a mono currency regime in favour of a domestic currency this marks the end of the multi currency he said the latest measures the imf says are welcome we welcome the reforms announced in the february 20 monetary policy statement and june 24 press release which seek to address economic distortions that have impaired macroeconomic stability imf representative to zimbabwe mr patrick imam told business weekly in an interview as part of monetary policy measures the rbz adjusted the interest rate on the reserve bank overnight window upwards from 15 percent per annum to 50 percent per annum in line with inflation trends it also removed administrative limits on the operation of bureaux de change and on the cap on margins for banks for interbank foreign exchange transactions to increase supply of foreign currency into interbank foreign market the rbz said it will ensure that at least 50 percent of the surrender portion of foreign currency is sold to the interbank market such moves were supported by mr imam who said hiking interest rates to 50 percent removing administrative limits on the bureau de change and relaxing the surrender requirements in a bid to stabilise the exchange rate are welcomed mr imam however said more needed to be done we encourage the authorities to continue ongoing efforts to implement a coherent monetary policy framework to pursue policies that preserve financial stability and ensure the orderly operation of payment systems and stop monetary financing of fiscal deficits to stabilise inflation and the exchange rate he said as part of this effort more transparency in monthly data statistics on the execution of the budget but especially on the evolution of money and credit will be important imam reiterated his earlier assertions that economic policies under the transitional stabilisation programme tsp if fully implemented under the watch of the imf s staff monitored programme are comprehensive enough to deal with the country s macroeconomic imbalances the economic policies of the new administration under the tsp constitute a comprehensive stabilisation and structural reform programme to address zimbabwe s deep macroeconomic imbalances a staff monitored programme smp that can support the authorities reform efforts has been approved by our management to cover the period may 15 2019 to march 15 2020 said mr imam the economic policies under the smp are anchored on the tsp and the smp is expected to help the authorities establish a track record of policy implementation in turn this will support efforts to re engage with the international community and move towards a comprehensive normalisation of relations with creditors he added that so far in 2019 the authorities policies appropriately focus on reducing the fiscal deficit to restore public debt sustainability whilst protecting investment in infrastructure and priority social spending including reconstruction and humanitarian support to respond to the drought and cyclone idai the reform programme also stopped the monetary accommodation of the fiscal deficit to stabilise inflation and the exchange rate at the same time the authorities are implementing foreign exchange reforms to maintain financial stability and improve the functioning of the market
the belief that wealth subsists not in ideas attitudes moral codes and mental disciplines but in identifiable and static things that can be seized and redistributed is the materialist superstition it stultified the works of marx and other prophets of violence and envy it frustrates every socialist revolutionary who imagines that by seizing the so called means of production he can capture the crucial capital of an economy it is the undoing of nearly every conglomerateur who believes he can safely enter new industries by buying rather than by learning them it confounds every bureaucrat who imagines he can buy the fruits of research and development the cost of capturing technology is mastery of the knowledge embodied in the underlying science the means of entrepreneurs production are not land labor or capital but minds and hearts whatever the inequality of incomes it is dwarfed by the inequality of contributions to human advancement as the science fiction writer robert heinlein wrote throughout history poverty is the normal condition of man advances that permit this norm to be exceeded here and there now and then are the work of an extremely small minority frequently despised often condemned and almost always opposed by all right thinking people whenever this tiny minority is kept from creating or as sometimes happens is driven out of society the people slip back into abject poverty this is known as bad luck president obama unconsciously confirmed heinlein s sardonic view of human nature in a campaign speech in iowa we had reversed the recession avoided depression got the economy moving again but over the last six months we ve had a run of bad luck all progress comes from the creative minority even government financed research and development outside the results oriented military is mostly wasted only the contributions of mind will and morality are enduring the most important question for the future of america is how we treat our entrepreneurs if our government continues to smear harass overtax and oppressively regulate them we will be dismayed by how swiftly the engines of american prosperity deteriorate we will be amazed at how quickly american wealth flees to other countries those most acutely threatened by the abuse of american entrepreneurs are the poor if the rich are stultified by socialism and crony capitalism the lower economic classes will suffer the most as the horizons of opportunity close high tax rates and oppressive regulations do not keep anyone from being rich they prevent poor people from becoming rich high tax rates do not redistribute incomes or wealth they redistribute taxpayers out of productive investment into overseas tax havens and out of offices and factories into beach resorts and municipal bonds but if the 1 percent and the 0 1 percent are respected and allowed to risk their wealth and new rebels are allowed to rise up and challenge them america will continue to be the land where the last regularly become the first by serving others george gilder knowledge and power the information theory of capitalism the ideas of economists and political philosophers both when they are right and when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood indeed the world is ruled by little else practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences are usually the slaves of some defunct economist john maynard keynes the general theory of employment interest and money nothing is more dangerous than a dogmatic worldview nothing more constraining more blinding to innovation more destructive of openness to novelty stephen jay gould dinosaur in a haystack reflections in natural history i think lord keynes himself would appreciate the irony that he has become the defunct economist under whose influence the academic and bureaucratic classes now toil slaves to what has become as much a religious belief system as an economic theory men and women who display appropriate skepticism on other topics indiscriminately funnel facts and data through a keynesian filter without ever questioning the basic assumptions some go on to prescribe government policies that have profound effects upon the citizens of their nations and when those policies create the conditions that engender the income inequality they so righteously oppose they often prescribe more of the same bad medicine like 18th century physicians applying leeches to their patients they take comfort that all right minded people will concur with their recommended treatments this is part of an ongoing series of a discussion between ray dalio and myself today s installment adapted from a letter i wrote several years ago addresses the philosophical problem he is trying to address income and wealth inequality last week i dealt with the equally significant problem of growing debt in the united states and the rest of the world the keynesian tools much of the economic establishment wants to use are exacerbating the problems ray would like to solve it with a blend of monetary and fiscal policy what he calls monetary policy 3 let s start with a classic definition of keynesianism from wikipedia so that we can all be comfortable that i m not coloring the definition with my own bias and yes i admit i have a bias emphasis mine keynesian economics or keynesianism is the view that in the short run especially during recessions economic output is strongly influenced by aggregate demand total spending in the economy in the keynesian view aggregate demand does not necessarily equal the productive capacity of the economy instead it is influenced by a host of factors and sometimes behaves erratically affecting production employment and inflation the theories forming the basis of keynesian economics were first presented by the british economist john maynard keynes in his book the general theory of employment interest and money published in 1936 during the great depression keynes contrasted his approach to the aggregate supply focused classical economics that preceded his book the interpretations of keynes that followed are contentious and several schools of economic thought claim his legacy keynesian economists often argue that private sector decisions sometimes lead to inefficient macroeconomic outcomes which require active policy responses by the public sector in particular monetary policy actions by the central bank and fiscal policy actions by the government in order to stabilize output over the business cycle keynesian economics advocates a mixed economy predominantly private sector but with a role for government intervention during recessions before i launch into a critique of keynesianism let me point out that i find much to admire in the thinking of john maynard keynes he was a great economist and taught us a great deal further and this is important my critique is simplistic a proper examination of the problems with keynesianism would require a lengthy paper or a book we are just skimming along the surface and don t have time for a deep dive central banks around the world and much of academia have been totally captured by keynesian thinking in the current avant garde world of neo keynesianism consumer demand consumption is everything federal reserve policy is clearly driven by the desire to stimulate demand through lower interest rates and easy money and keynesian economists of all stripes want fiscal policy essentially government budgets to increase consumer demand if the consumer can t do it the reasoning goes then the government should step into the breach this of course requires deficit spending and borrowed money including from your local central bank essentially when a central bank lowers interest rates it is encouraging banks to lend money to businesses and telling consumers to borrow money to spend economists like to see fiscal stimulus at the same time as well they point to the numerous recessions that have ended after fiscal stimulus and lower rates were applied they see the ending of recessions as proof that keynesian doctrine works this thinking has several problems first using leverage borrowed money to stimulate spending today must by definition reduce consumption in the future debt is future consumption denied or future consumption brought forward keynesian economists argue that bringing just enough future consumption into the present to stimulate positive growth outweighs the future drag on consumption as long as there is still positive growth leverage just equalizes the ups and downs this has a certain logic of course which is why it is such a widespread belief keynes argued however that money borrowed to alleviate recession should be repaid when growth resumes my reading of keynes does not suggest he believed in the unending fiscal stimulus his disciples encourage today secondly as has been well documented by ken rogoff and carmen reinhart there comes a point at which too much leverage becomes destructive there is no exact way to know that point it arrives when lenders typically in the private sector decide that borrowers whether private or government might have some difficulty repaying and begin asking for more interest to compensate for their risks an overleveraged economy can t afford the higher rates and economic contraction ensues sometimes the contraction is severe sometimes it can be absorbed when accompanied by the popping of an economic bubble it is particularly disastrous and can take a decade or longer to work itself out as the developed world is finding out now every major economic miracle since the end of world war ii has been a result of leverage often this leverage has been accompanied by stimulative fiscal and monetary policies every single miracle has ended in tears with the exception of the current recent runaway expansion in china which is still in its early stages and this is why so many eyes in the investment world are laser focused on china forget about a hard landing or a recession a simple slowdown in china has profound effects on the rest of the world i would argue along i think with the austrian economist hayek and other economic schools that recessions are not the result of insufficient consumption but rather insufficient income fiscal and monetary policy should aim to grow incomes over the entire range of the economy that is best accomplished by making it easier for entrepreneurs and businesspeople to provide goods and services when businesses increase production they hire more workers and incomes go up without income there are no tax revenues to redistribute without income and production nothing of any economic significance happens keynes was correct when he observed that recessions are periods of reduced consumption but that is a result and not a cause like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here first name this is required email this is required subscribe for free recaptcha entrepreneurs must be willing to create a product or offer a service in the hope there will be sufficient demand for their work there are no guarantees and they risk economic peril with their ventures whether we re talking about the local bakery or hairdressing shop or elon musk trying to compete with the world s largest automakers if government or central bank policies hamper their efforts the economy stagnates many politicians and academics favor keynesianism because it offers a theory by which government actions can become decisive in the economy it lets governments and central banks meddle in the economy and feel justified it allows 12 people sitting in a board room in washington dc to feel they are in charge of setting the most important price in the world the price of money interest rates of the us dollar and that they know more than the entrepreneurs and businesspeople who are actually in the market risking their own capital every day this is essentially the platonic philosopher king conceit the hubristic notion that a small group of wise elites is capable of directing the economic actions of a country no matter how educated or successful the populace has been on its own and never mind that the world has multiple clear examples of how central controls eventually slow growth and make things worse over time it is only when free people are allowed to set their own prices of goods and services and yes even interest rates that valid market clearing prices can be determined trying to control them results in one group being favored over another in today s world savers and entrepreneurs are left to eat the crumbs that fall from the plates of the well connected crony capitalists and live off the income from repressed interest rates the irony of using cheap money to drive consumer demand is that retirees and savers get less money to spend and that clearly drives their consumption down why is the consumption produced by ballooning debt better than the consumption produced by hard work and savings this is trickle down monetary policy which ironically favors the very large banks and institutions if you ask keynesian central bankers if they want to be seen as helping the rich and connected they will stand back and forcefully tell you no but that is what happens when you start down the road of financial repression someone benefits so far it has not been main street as george gilder said those most acutely threatened by the abuse of american entrepreneurs are the poor if the rich are stultified by socialism and crony capitalism the lower economic classes will suffer the most as the horizons of opportunity close high tax rates and oppressive regulations do not keep anyone from being rich they prevent poor people from becoming rich high tax rates do not redistribute incomes or wealth they redistribute taxpayers out of productive investment into overseas tax havens and out of offices and factories into beach resorts and municipal bonds those who were forced to endure economics 101 may remember that savings investment in any real world economic system you must have savings in order to have investment in order for the economy to grow generally savings are actually leveraged to produce more investments and thus eventual production and consumption than if the profit recipients had simply spent the money themselves this will become critically important next week this idea that consumption is better than savings is the heart of the keynesian conceit yes i know i ve written many a time about keynes s paradox of thrift it is a good thing for individuals to save but if everybody saves then there is less consumption that seems true on the surface and makes a great sound bite but it has an inherent flaw it assumes that savings don t become investments that increase productivity which in turn leads to the production of more goods and services which ultimately creates income which then creates more demand without savings nothing happens nothing there has to be capital of some kind from somewhere in order for economic activity to happen productivity growth is ultimately a product of savings and it is productivity growth that will generate an increase in income for the country as a whole there are consequences to the fact that savings are close to an all time low and when those limited savings go to purchase government bonds it takes money away from more productive and income producing endeavors a static economy does not raise overall income or wealth only an economy that is growing as a result of a healthy level of savings and investment can produce the results keynesian economists want increased incomes for everyone your typical keynesian economist isn t willing to wait for savings to become investment they and the politicians they serve want results today and the only way to get results today is to get people to spend today while the process of saving and investing takes time neo keynesian economists are ultimately teenage children who want the pleasure of consuming today rather than thinking about the future and i won t even go into the burden we are placing on future generations by borrowing money to goose our current economy and expecting them to pay that money back we are building toward a future intergenerational war that is going to be very intense once our children learn how we misspent their future but that s yet another letter early august sees me in new york for a few days before the annual economic fishing event camp kotok then maybe another day in new york before i meet shane in montana and spend a few days with my close friend darrell cain on flathead lake after a long day spent in airports i arrived at my home in puerto rico shane is in california in the early evening with the full intent of writing and finishing a much different letter than the one above then i realized i did not have the key to the house shane and i had talked about dealing with such a contingency but we never actually did it that will shortly change and while the key did materialize some six hours later the new time constraints forced me to go back to previous material to address what is a serious obstacle to resolving the problems ray and i see next week we will look at policies that not only increase savings and investment but will restart economic growth and put us back on track to more equitable distribution of the economic pie and with that i will hit the send button and wish

spread the love the international monetary fund imf says the latest reforms announced by both the ministry of finance and economic development through si 142 of 2019 and the reserve bank of zimbabwe through exchange control directive ru102 2019 are welcome as they seek to address economic distortions that have impaired macroeconomic stability last week government introduced a raft of changes that saw the country finally abandoning the multicurrency regime that had been in place since 2009 through si 142 of 2019 government outlawed the use of any foreign currency in local transactions but still allowed the buying and selling of foreign currency on a willing buyer willing seller basis the zimbabwe dollar shall with effect from june 24 2019 be the sole legal tender in zimbabwe in all transactions reads si 142 the british pound united states dollar south african rand botswana pula and any other foreign currency whatsoever shall no longer be legal tender alongside the zimbabwe dollar in any transactions in zimbabwe commenting on the changes minister of finance and economic development professor mthuli ncube said what was happening in the market was that the market was self us dollarising it was uncontrollable and we felt that we needed to bring the situation under control quite clearly it became an untenable situation and it became necessary for government to move a lot faster and introduce a mono currency regime in favour of a domestic currency this marks the end of the multi currency he said the latest measures the imf says are welcome we welcome the reforms announced in the february 20 monetary policy statement and june 24 press release which seek to address economic distortions that have impaired macroeconomic stability imf representative to zimbabwe mr patrick imam told business weekly in an interview as part of monetary policy measures the rbz adjusted the interest rate on the reserve bank overnight window upwards from 15 percent per annum to 50 percent per annum in line with inflation trends it also removed administrative limits on the operation of bureaux de change and on the cap on margins for banks for interbank foreign exchange transactions to increase supply of foreign currency into interbank foreign market the rbz said it will ensure that at least 50 percent of the surrender portion of foreign currency is sold to the interbank market such moves were supported by mr imam who said hiking interest rates to 50 percent removing administrative limits on the bureau de change and relaxing the surrender requirements in a bid to stabilise the exchange rate are welcomed mr imam however said more needed to be done we encourage the authorities to continue ongoing efforts to implement a coherent monetary policy framework to pursue policies that preserve financial stability and ensure the orderly operation of payment systems and stop monetary financing of fiscal deficits to stabilise inflation and the exchange rate he said as part of this effort more transparency in monthly data statistics on the execution of the budget but especially on the evolution of money and credit will be important imam reiterated his earlier assertions that economic policies under the transitional stabilisation programme tsp if fully implemented under the watch of the imf s staff monitored programme are comprehensive enough to deal with the country s macroeconomic imbalances the economic policies of the new administration under the tsp constitute a comprehensive stabilisation and structural reform programme to address zimbabwe s deep macroeconomic imbalances a staff monitored programme smp that can support the authorities reform efforts has been approved by our management to cover the period may 15 2019 to march 15 2020 said mr imam the economic policies under the smp are anchored on the tsp and the smp is expected to help the authorities establish a track record of policy implementation in turn this will support efforts to re engage with the international community and move towards a comprehensive normalisation of relations with creditors he added that so far in 2019 the authorities policies appropriately focus on reducing the fiscal deficit to restore public debt sustainability whilst protecting investment in infrastructure and priority social spending including reconstruction and humanitarian support to respond to the drought and cyclone idai the reform programme also stopped the monetary accommodation of the fiscal deficit to stabilise inflation and the exchange rate at the same time the authorities are implementing foreign exchange reforms to maintain financial stability and improve the functioning of the market share this share twitter facebook email linkedin reddit pinterest whatsapp like this like loading
authored by dagny taggart via the organic prepper blog we are living in precarious times and if you haven t prepared for an economic collapse yet it is time to start taking action despite what some experts would like you to believe the us is on shaky financial ground several indicators suggest things are far worse than many think let s take a look at them now more than half of families in the us live in asset poverty a recent study found that more than 63 percent of american children and 55 percent of americans live in asset poverty this means they have few or no assets to rely on in the event of a financial emergencysuch as a job loss a medical crisis recessions or natural disasters in a press release study co author david rothwell an assistant professor in osu s college of public health and human sciences explained that when families lack assets such as vehicles homes savings accounts or investments surviving a financial crisis is very difficult this is a dimension of financial security that we don t think about that much and it s pretty high the findings highlight the extent of financial insecurity among american families these shocks ripple through the family and down to the children rothwell said the study was published in the journal children and youth services review earlier this year co authors are timothy ottusch of the university of arizona and jennifer finders of purdue university living in poverty can have devastating impacts on children as the press release explains rothwell studies poverty and its impact on families and children experiencing poverty in childhood can have lifetime impacts for those children past research has shown that children who grow up in poverty are more likely to struggle in school have lower job earnings throughout life and experience family instability as adults a growing body of research suggests that parents asset levels also predict academic achievement educational expectations and the likelihood of college enrollment and graduation families with assets that can be used when income is disrupted are also likely to experience less financial stress and strain yet asset poverty is higher than income poverty for children and families in a 2018 study of canadian families researchers including rothwell found that asset poverty was two to three times more prevalent than income poverty families can have adequate day to day funds but be asset poor and would likely struggle during a financial shock source rent is becoming unaffordable for many americans according to the national low income housing coalition renting is becoming increasingly unaffordable for many americans in its latest out of reach report the organization explains that the struggle to find affordable housing is not limited to those earning minimum wage or the unemployed the report s central statistic is the housing wage which is an estimate of the hourly wage a full time worker must earn to rent a home without spending more than 30 percent of income on housing costs for 2019 the housing wage is 22 96 and 18 65 for a modest two and one bedroom apartment respectively based on the fair market rent the average renter s hourly wage is 1 08 less than the housing wage for a one bedroom rental and 5 39 less than a two bedroom rental that means that an average renter in the u s has to work a 52 hour week to put this in perspective a median wage worker in eight of the country s largest ten occupations does not earn enough to afford a one bedroom apartment an employee earning the federal minimum wage 7 25 per hour would have to work 127 hours every week equivalent to more than two full time jobs to afford a two bedroom apartment this is not just a regional issue there isn t a single state metro area or county in the u s where a full time employee earning the minimum wage can afford to rent a two bedroom property to explore data for your area enter your zip code in the box below the map on this page out of reach 2019 according to the report the ten jobs that are expected to see the biggest growth over the coming decade are those that pay less than the wage needed to afford housing and that is likely to result in an even greater disparity between wages and housing costs by 2026 as this infographic from statista illustrates food is about to become more expensive massive damaging floods in the midwest have been occurring since this past march to make a bad situation worse the potential for more floods in key agricultural states looms in front of us as more rain is predicted for the rest of this spring so far heavy flooding has impacted important agricultural states including nebraska iowa illinois and missouri the economic impacts of the flooding are likely to be devastating as cat ellis explained in midwest flooding will cause shortages of these foods we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us bottom line our modern food supply is largely dependent upon grains and soy with major producers losing at least one harvest this year the cost of manufactured food and livestock feed will skyrocket meat and dairy will be doubly impacted while many farms lost animals to floodwaters and farmers lost money due to both lost animals and damage to property the cost to feed those remaining animals is going to go through the roof add to this livestock disease and tariffs and trade war with both mexico and china the two countries from whom we import the most food both consumers and farmers are in deep financial trouble whatever your situation is start thinking about what you eat and how to store those items ellis wrote here s how to get started building that stockpile americans are losing purchasing power purchasing power is the value of a currency expressed in terms of the amount of goods or services that one unit of money can buy in other words it is how much your money buys you purchasing power is important because all else being equal inflation decreases the amount of goods or services you are able to purchase inflation reduces the value of a currency s purchasing power in the article america s concealed crisis fifty years of economic decline 1969 to 2019 charles hugh smith explains how the loss of purchasing power has pushed the middle class into the working class the keys to understanding the concealed crisis of decline are purchasing power relative to wages earnings how many goods and services can wages buy for the average american household wages have risen modestly while the purchasing power of those wages has plummeted furthermore the quality of goods and services has in many cases declined sharply so that even if prices have dropped what you get for your money has fallen even further effectively reducing the purchasing power of your wages source smith also discusses how planned obsolescence impacts purchasing power case in point appliances were once designed and built to last a generation or longer refrigerators washers and dryers lasted for decades now the average appliance fails within a few years and the electronic board costing roughly a third of the entire appliance price fails and must be replaced with labor the cost of the repair is so high consumers often send the almost new appliance to the landfill and buy a new and soon to fail appliance net net low quality reduces purchasing power even if price has declined source although our income is higher than it was 40 years ago we can t buy much with it smith says bottom line how much housing higher education and well being does the average wage buy now compared to decades past not much the statistics are bleak wages are basically unchanged from the high water mark 50 years ago which coincidentally was also the high water mark of u s energy production until very recently adjusted for purchasing power and quality the average paycheck buys far less than it did 50 years ago source evidence that the economy has already entered a downturn is mounting a few days ago michael snyder summed up some of the signs the us economy is starting to deteriorate rapidly in the article the pain of this new economic downturn is starting to show up all over the country on tuesday we got some more new numbers and they were just as bad as we thought they might be but even before today s numbers all of the data were telling us the exact same thing the new york fed s empire state manufacturing index just suffered the worst one month decline in u s history morgan stanley s business conditions index just suffered the largest one month decline that we have ever seen global trade numbers are the worst they have been since the last recession and just last week i detailed the complete and utter bloodbath that we are witnessing in the u s trucking industry right now so considering what we already knew it shouldn t have been a surprise that new home sales in the u s were down a whopping 7 8 percent during the month of may source in addition an economic indicator that has preceded every recession over the past five decades occurred a few days ago reports npr it is known among economists and wall street traders as a yield curve inversion and it refers to when long term interest rates are paying out less than short term rates that curve has been flattening out and sloping down for more than a year raising worries among some analysts that investors long term view of the market is not positive and that an economic downturn is looming but on sunday an inauspicious milestone was achieved the yield curve remained inverted for three months or an entire quarter which has for half a century been a clear signal that the economy is heading for recession in the next nine to 18 months according to campbell harvey a duke university finance professor who spoke to npr on sunday his research in the mid 1980s first linked yield curve inversions to recessions that has been associated with predicting a recession for the last seven recessions harvey said from the 1960s this indicator has been reliable in terms of foretelling a recession and also importantly it has not given any false signals yet source the economy has not recovered much since the 2008 recession many refer to stock market valuation and the official unemployment rate as indicators of an improving economy but the truth is that they paint a deceiving picture of the true state of the american economy as economist antony p mueller outlines in phony economic growth stats conceal deep problems on main street alternative calculations of the employment data which include long term discouraged workers and chronically unemployed indicate that the labor market is much slacker than the official statistics indicate profits recovered in the first few years after the crisis of 2008 but over the past five years they have been flat stock prices in turn as measured by the s p 500 index have risen by over 50 percent since 2012 the recovery after the crisis of 2008 was brought about by the stimulus packages and later on by the monetary policy of quantitative easing the expansion that followed does not constitute genuine economic growth while the financial asset markets indicate wealth creation the economy s productive capacity tends to remain weak over the past ten years the congressional budget office had to lower its estimate of potential output year by year and productivity growth has stayed below the trend of the time before the crisis of 2008 source in the conclusion of that piece dr mueller states policymakers ignore the main lesson of the crisis of 2008 that monetary and fiscal stimulus policies do not bring about a solid recovery but manufacture a phony economic growth that distorts the economy s structure of production instead of a v shaped recovery that would occur if government abstained from intervention policymakers produce an l shaped agony as if a prolonged stagnation wasn t already bad enough the interventionists also act as the undertakers of capitalism policy intervention distorts the economy and drives a wedge between wall street and main street the majority of the people do not attribute the discrepancy between the growth of financial wealth and the stagnation of the real economy to the policy of the authorities but accuses capitalism of this evil source here s what you can do to prepare for a financial crisis if you are skeptical about the warning signs of the impending economic disaster that i have outlined in this brief article here s a great resource to refer to as you monitor current events 10 recession warning signs you need to know as much as one would like to believe that the american economy has bucked the cycle of boom and bust that has defined every market economy since the dawn of time that s probably not the case in spite of a booming stock market and rock bottom unemployment history would dictate that the good times will be coming to an end probably sooner rather than later writer joel anderson warns in the article he describes economic behaviors that point to the possibility of a looming recession here is a list of resources to help you prepare while the fate of the us economy is out of our hands there are things we can do to prepare for an economic downturn and eventual crash the preparation is completely in our hands those who choose not to prepare are going to be in for a very hard time what do you think do you think an economic collapse is inevitable or do you think the economy is going to stabilize what are you doing to

george osborne the former uk chancellor of the exchequer is touting himself as the next head of the international monetary fund he is hoping to fill the forthcoming vacancy as the current managing director christine lagarde has been nominated to be the next president of the european central bank according to the financial times osborne told friends that the imf requires a skilled political communicator and operator not a technocrat but osborne s interest in running one of the world s most powerful international organisations has been met with widespread criticism from across the political spectrum and among professional economists over his record at the helm of the uk economy for example danny blanchflower a former member of the bank of england s monetary policy committee described osborne as the worst uk chancellor in 300 years well qualified on a superficial level osborne is well qualified to lead the imf first as a european he passes the nationality test the world bank and the imf stitch up their top jobs so that the president of the bank is decided by the united states and the managing director of the imf is a european it s one of the traditions of international economic governance second osborne s economic philosophy as shown in his role as the architect of austerity in the uk is closely aligned with the imf s the fund s traditional core belief is that there should be minimal state intervention in the economy and that countries that receive financial help are required to implement privatisation deregulation and other pro market policies epa efe fazry ismail digging deeper into osborne s job application however shows that he does not tick all the boxes according to the imf s selection criteria the successful candidate for the position of managing director will have a distinguished record in economic policymaking at senior levels the main distinguishing feature of osborne s policy record was presiding over the worst economic recovery in british history since the industrial revolution osborne was a passionate advocate of austerity policies which led to a retrenchment of the state at exactly the time when the uk economy needed a fiscal boost read more fact check has austerity held back economic growth masked by the need for prudence osborne s uncompromising approach to cutting public spending in an ideological bid to reduce the deficit and national debt led to depressed output and stagnant real wages it was the bank of england that tried to pick up the slack an aggressively loose monetary policy including quantitative easing has helped the economy stagger along but extremely low interest rates and readily available cash for investors has had the knock on effect of inflating assets such as house prices ironically despite his austerity policies and focus on balancing the budget osborne consistently overshot his public borrowing targets this is because slow growth leads to lower than expected tax revenues plus osborne s austerity damaged the long term growth potential of the economy due to a lack of investment in infrastructure skills and innovation time for a new direction it is not just economic competence that lets osborne down his economic philosophy is becoming out of kilter with the direction of travel of the imf slowly but surely the imf is moving away from its strict adherence to orthodox pro market policies as it recognises the damage they have caused to many economies economists at the imf have criticised neoliberal policies that they recognise have increased inequality in turn jeopardising durable expansion even outgoing chief christine lagarde has called for greater public spending by governments to boost growth the last things that the imf needs now is a skilled political communicator and operator it needs someone to accelerate the use of more pluralist policies which distributes power among more groups instead of dictating policies from the top it must completely jettison its historic one policy fits all approach that has so often failed countries that the fund exists to help from greece to argentina it is also about time that the european monopoly on leadership of the imf comes to an end the balance of world economic power is shifting from west to east with china already the largest economy if measured in purchasing power parity the major international institutions must embrace this new global reality instead of taking a step backwards and hiring a candidate like george osborne
source xinhua 2019 07 05 20 50 57 editor xuxin video player close by tichaona chifamba harare july 5 xinhua there have been mixed feelings over the imposition of a law on june 24 which banned the use of foreign currencies as legal tender in zimbabwe and the re introduction of the zimbabwe dollar now rtgs dollar some locals fear that some basic goods will soon disappear from the shelves of retail shops while others have welcomed the move saying that it will contain runaway prices caused by continued use of the united states dollar as a parallel unit of trade the country had abandoned the zimbabwe dollar in 2009 amid hyper inflation and the currency was officially demonetized in 2015 statutory instrument 142 si 142 of 2019 otherwise known as the reserve bank of zimbabwe legal tender regulations 2019 rattled the economy in the past week to such an extent that the u s dollar parallel market fell from a high of 1 16 rtgs dollars to as low as 1 7 rtgs dollars prompting panicky citizens to quickly dispose of their greenbacks at low rates individuals earning their salaries in foreign currency can still withdraw it but must first change it into local currency before making any transactions the government has since warned that it is now a criminal offence for storekeepers to price their goods in u s dollars or any other foreign currency and for anyone to use foreign currency rather than zimbabwe dollars in any transaction carried out in the country apart from the u s dollar other currencies that were banned were british pound euro australian dollar chinese yuan japanese yen indian rupee south african rand and the botswana pula one of the reasons why the government decided to impose the foreign currency ban was that some retailers and suppliers had begun pegging their prices mainly in u s dollars yet the majority of zimbabweans earn their salaries in local currency the pegging of prices in u s dollars had also resulted in prices of basic commodities rising every week which had led to discontent among lowly paid government workers and many others in the private sector prices of some commodities except bread meat beef pork and chicken and milk have been falling since the imposition of the new policy and also amid fears of reprisal following a stern warning from president emmerson mnangagwa that those who continued to increase prices would be punished some imported goods such as potato crisps have since disappeared from the shelves as they can no longer be replaced using local currency leading retail chain ok zimbabwe limited welcomed the new law saying that it would stabilize prices which had continued to rise as they chased the parallel exchange rate movement we welcome the new si 142 which we believe will stabilize prices and allow us to deliver the good prices and value you have always expected and enjoyed from us we have always received good support from our supplier partners accordingly we have engaged them and some have started to moderate prices in response to si 142 the retail chain said in a statement friday a manager with another leading retail chain said that suppliers had promised to start reviewing their prices downwards in the coming week after disposing of goods they had acquired using the previous parallel rate regime other retailers under the banner of the confederation of zimbabwe retailers czr have welcomed the government pronouncement adding that they also support measures taken by the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz to stabilize the interbank foreign currency market the pricing distortions arising from the inflated and stage managed parallel market had left most zimbabweans reeling and on the brink of total poverty as incomes wages and salaries were eroded daily by the fictitious and fallacious black market exchange rate the dilemma was exacerbated by the demand for u s dollars for domestic transactions even for goods ordinarily manufactured in zimbabwe yet about 96 percent of the workforce earn their wages and salaries in local currency many had to offload the rtgs dollars or bond notes as soon as they laid their hands on it said czr president denford mutashu in a statement opposition party mdc secretary for policy and research tapiwa mashakada however said the banning of foreign currency as legal tender was a panic move by the government to have domestic currency there must be productivity and re industrialization at least six months forex reserves there must be confidence you must be a net exporter and you must give notice to public he said he added that he foresaw the market rejecting the zimbabwe dollar rtgs dollar and continuing to use the u s dollar incidentally the use of the u s dollar is continuing unabated in the informal sector while some customers also opt to use the u s dollar as opposed to local currency mutashu warned against the uncontrolled printing of money as had happened during the hyper inflationary period the czr further urges the rbz to exercise restraint and prudence with the printing machine to safeguard the value of the zimbabwe dollar while the ministry of finance should desist from inconsistent policy pronouncements that have dented trust and confidence in the past further measures should be a product of continued consultations and engagement while the inclusive approach is encouraged forthwith he said he said the introduction of the zimbabwe dollar would further improve competitiveness and efforts should be made to ensure that the importation of essential raw materials capital goods drugs and medicines fuel and energy is not impeded by the policy changeover ordinary people are still to ascertain the long term impact of the new policy hastings muchirahondo an officer work in a company in harare said he would welcome the move as long as prices remained steady and basic goods were available there is no point making a policy under which we will all go hungry because there are no goods in the shelves not all of us can afford to travel across the borders to south africa botswana and mozambique to buy basic goods as was the case in 2008 up to 2009 he said another harare resident tonderai masango

rttnews the major u s index futures are currently pointing to a lower opening on friday as trading is set to resume following the independence day holiday on thursday stock futures came under pressure following the release of a labor department showing a substantial reacceleration in the pace of u s job growth in the month of june the report said employment surged up by 224 000 jobs in june after edging up by a downwardly revised 72 000 jobs in may economists had expected employment to increase by about 160 000 jobs while the data points to a rebound in the labor market following the weakness seen in may the report has dampened investor hopes for a near term interest rate cut by the federal reserve stocks showed a strong move to the upside over the course of a holiday shortened trading

originally reported for the previous month even with the us china trade talks back on track for now at least the evidence of a slowdown in employment growth should still be enough to persuade the fed to cut rates in either july or september said paul ashworth chief u s economist at capital economics cme group s fedwatch tool shows an interest rate cut of at least 25 basis points at the fed s july meeting is priced into the markets although ashworth said expectations of a 50 basis point cut seem misplaced stocks saw further upside after a report from the institute for supply showing a notable slowdown in the pace of service sector growth added to the optimism about a rate cut the ism said its non manufacturing index dropped to 55 1 in june from 56 9 in may hitting its lowest level since a matching reading in july of 2017 while a reading above 50 still indicates growth in service sector activity economists had expected the index to show a more modest decrease to 55 9 a separate report released by the commerce department showed the u s trade deficit widened by more than anticipated in the month of may as the value of imports jumped by much more than the value of exports the commerce department said the trade deficit widened to 55 5 billion in may from a revised 51 2 billion in april economists had expected the trade deficit to widen to 54 0 billion the wider trade deficit came as the value of imports surged up by 3 3 percent to 266 2 billion compared to a 2 0 percent jump in the value of exports to 210 6 billion andrew hunter senior u s economist at capital economics said the wider than expected deficit suggests net trade was a slightly bigger drag on second quarter gdp growth than we had previously anticipated despite the recent ceasefire agreed between presidents donald trump and xi jinping we still think it is slightly more likely than not that the trade dispute with china will ultimately escalate further hunter said he added the upshot is that net trade is likely to remain a modest drag on growth over the second half of this year which we expect to compound a sharp slowdown in domestic demand growth interest rate sensitive commercial real estate stocks turned

menafn dailyfx how to trade geopolitical risks talking pointsthe global economy is showing increasing weakness and fragility eroding economic fortitude exposes markets to geopolitical risks examples of political threats in asia latin america and europe see our free guide to learn how touse economic news in your trading strategy analyzing geopolitical risks as 2019 continues to unfold political risks are growing increasingly relevant to watch as their capacity for inducing market wide volatility is significantly expanding globally liberal oriented ideologies that is those favoring free trade and integrated capital markets are being undermined by nationalist and populist movements the result though not always is violent volatility stemming from uncertainty against the backdrop of a slowing global economy and central banks pausing or reversing their rate hike cycles the introduction of additional uncertainty will likely create even more volatility what makes political risk so dangerous and elusive is the limited ability investors have for pricing it in traders may therefore find themselves hot under the collar as the global political landscape continues to unpredictably shift generally speaking markets do not really care about political categorizations but are more concerned with the economic policies embedded in the agenda of whoever holds the reigns of the sovereign policies that stimulate economic growth typically acts as a magnet for investors looking to park capital where it will garner the highest yield these include the implementation of fiscal stimulus plans fortifying property rights allowing for goods and capital to flow freely and dissolving growth sapping regulations if these policies create adequate inflationary pressure it could prompt the central bank to raise interest rates as a response and lead to a stronger exchange rate for the country concerned conversely if you have a government whose underlying ideological predilections go against the gradient of globalization this may cause capital flight regimes that seek to rip out the threads that have sown economic and political integration usually create a moat of uncertainty that investors do not want to traverse themes of ultra nationalism protectionism and populism have frequently shown to have market disrupting effects if a state undergoes an ideological realignment traders will assess the situation to see if it radically alters their risk reward set up if so investors may then reallocate their capital and re formulate their trading strategies that tilt the balance of risk to reward in their favor however in doing so volatility will likely follow as the reformulated trading strategy is reflected in the market wide redistribution of capital across various assets europe eurosceptic populism in italy in italy the2018 election roiled regional markets and eventually rippled almost throughout the entire financial system the ascendancy of the anti establishment right wing lega nord and ideologically ambivalent 5 star movement was founded on a campaign of populism with a built in rejection of the status quo the uncertainty accompanying this new regime was then promptly priced in and resulted in significantly volatility the risk premium for holding italy s assets rose and was reflected in an over one hundred percent spike in italian 10 year bond yields due to investors demanding a higher return for tolerating what they perceived to be a higher level of risk this was also reflected in the dramatic widening of the spread on credit default swaps on italian sovereign debt due toincreased fears that italy could be the next epicenter of another eu debt crisis eurusd eurchfplummeted as mediterranean sovereign bond yields spiked amid fears of another eurozone debt crisis theus dollar japanese yenandswiss francall gained at the expense of theeuroas investors re directed their capital to anti risk assets the euro s suffering is being prolonged by the dispute between rome and brussels over the former s budgetary ambitions the government s fiscal exceptionalism is a feature of their anti establishment nature that in turn introduced greater uncertainty and was then reflected in a weaker euro latin america nationalist populism in brazil while president jair bolsonaro is generally characterized as a fire brand nationalist with populist underpinnings the market reaction to his ascendency was met with open arms by investors his appointment of paulo guedes a university of chicago trained economist with a penchant for privatization and regulatory restructuring boosted sentiment and investor s confidence on brazilian assets ibovespa daily chart since june 2018 the benchmark ibovespa equity index has risen over 46 percent compared with only a little over 9 percent in thes p 500over the same time period during the election in october the ibovespa rose over 12 percent in one month as polls revealed that bolsonaro was going to triumph over his left wing counterpart fernando haddad ibovespa spiked almost five percent after october 7 vote and polls showed bolsonaro in the lead since bolsonaro s ascension to the presidency the oscillations in equity markets and rate of capital inflow frequently move in tandem with the level of progress on his market disrupting pension reforms investors are anticipating these structural adjustment will be strong enough to pull brazil s economy away from the precipice of a recession and toward a strong growth trajectory unburdened by unsustainable public spending asia hindu nationalism in india the re election of prime minister narendra modi was broadly welcome by markets though lingering concerns were raised about the effect of hindu nationalism on regional stability however modi also has a reputation of being a business friendly politician his election lured investors into diverting a significant amount of capital into indian assets following his ascendancy to the presidency however the optimistic outlook from investors could be undermined if risk appetite sours amid rising tensions in the region in the first breathes of 2019 india pakistan relations drastically escalated amid a skirmish over the disputed kashmir region ever since the 1947 partition the hostility between the two nuclear powers has always remained a regional risk india nifty 50 benchmark equity index s p 500 futures andaudjpyfall amid political volatility nationalist campaigns and governments are embedded with political risk because the very nature of such a regime relies on displaying strength and frequently equates compromise with capitulation in times of political volatility and economic fragility the financial impact of a diplomatic breakdown is amplified by the fact that a resolution to a dispute will likely be prolonged due to the inherently stubborn nature of nationalist regimes us president donald trump and modi employ a similar brand of strong rhetoric both on the campaign trail and within their respective administrations in a rather ironic way their ideological similarity may in fact be a force that causes a rift in diplomatic relations tensions between the two have escalated recentlywith markets worrying thatwashington may start another trade war in asia only this time it will be with india why political risks matter for trading countless studies have shown that a significant decline in living standards from war or a severe recession increases the propensity for voters to occupy radical positions on the political spectrum as such people are more likely to deviate from market friendly policies such as capital integration and trade liberalization and instead focus on measures that turn away from globalization and are deleteriously inward facing the modern globalized economy is interconnected both politically and economically and therefore any systemic shock has a high probability of echoing out into the world during times of significant political volatility amid inter continental ideological changes it is crucial to monitor these developments because within them are opportunities to set up short medium and long term

as the country faces economic meltdown the government has again imposed policy without any legislative underpinning by derek matyszak on 24 june familiar feelings of despair accompanied the shock announcement by finance minister mthuli ncube that only zimbabwe s quasi currency the rtgs dollar would constitute legal tender this prelude to the resurrection of the dreaded zimbabwe dollar added to the sense of déjà vu brought on by long queues for fuel inflation over 100 18 hour load shedding and failed water reticulation the rtgs dollar from the real time gross settlement system used to transfer money electronically exists only in electronic form in theory and government pronouncements rtgs dollars were merely the electronic representation of united states dollars held in depositors accounts however after 2016 when government began paying its debts by entering billions of dollars of credit on to the books of banks unsupported by anything it became apparent that the rtgs dollar wasn t what it was held out to be its value steadily declined in february this year government finally abandoned the fiction that rtgs dollars were us dollars real us dollars were ring fenced in depositors nostro accounts and rtgs dollars held under a second separate account this measure was accompanied by another where government claimed that the exchange rate between us dollar and rtgs dollars would be allowed to float and be determined by interbank trading another lie in practice government tightly controlled the rate of exchange so that the interbank rate for us dollars was generally half that offered by the black market as a result opportunities for arbitrage by the political and business elite abounded they could procure us dollars from the central bank at the interbank rate and sell them on the black market for twice the amount raking in millions business could also borrow rtgs money from banks immediately exchanging it for us dollars on the black market driving the demand for us dollars up and the value of rtgs dollars down once the value of rtgs money had declined significantly only a fraction of the us dollars acquired needed to be changed back to repay the rtgs debt to the bank representing millions of dollars of profit nice work if you can get it not however very nice for workers civil servants and the lower ranks of the military being paid in rtgs dollars the real value of their wages plummeted when the rtgs dollar was set as sole legal tender on 24 june its value to the us dollar had fallen from about 1 4 1 in february to over 13 5 1 and was set to drop further in an accelerated fall services and goods particularly imported products were being charged or priced in us dollars the economy was re dollarising and civil servants were demanding that they be paid in us dollars ncube introduced statutory instrument 142 setting rtgs money as sole legal tender in the midst of negotiations around wages with civil servants this was done to undermine the argument that since goods and services were being charged in us dollars civil servants should be paid in this currency it was also an attempt to stop the rapid depreciation of rtgs money to strengthen the rtgs dollar the reserve bank mopped up rtgs liquidity from banks returning 1 2 billion of the faux currency to the ether from whence it came hidden in the turmoil that has followed are two other replays of prior events one is that just as government had tried to defy the market and legislate price controls in the days of record breaking hyperinflation in 2008 it is now trying to legislate that the incoming tide of re dollarisation stay out the second is more pernicious it is the sight of zimbabweans again rushing to the cliff edge like lemmings on the basis of government fiat as occurred with government s now defunct indigenisation laws introduced in 2010 then robert mugabe s government issued regulations that it said required all foreign owned business in zimbabwe to surrender 51 of their shares to indigenous zimbabweans in fact the law did not and could not provide anything of the sort companies do not own their shares shareholders do the government s claim as to the meaning of its regulations was never challenged not by the media as it made a good blood on the floor story and not by affected businesses who knew that government could make life difficult by withholding licences required to do business in zimbabwe fast forward to 2019 government says statutory instrument 142criminalises transactions in us dollars the police have been unleashed to prowl around petrol stations and retail outlets ready to arrest any hapless person using us dollars in fact si 142 doesn t ban the use of us dollars for trade it simply sets rtgs dollars as the sole legal tender if someone decides to dispose of their car in exchange for 10 goats there is no law preventing him or her from doing so even though goats don t constitute legal tender substitute us dollars for goats and the point is clear countries that wish to ban transactions in anything other than the local currency enact laws providing that so why didn t zimbabwe s finance minister do that because he has no power under the reserve bank act to prohibit us dollar transactions however as in the case of the indigenisation regulations the media happily accepts his interpretation of his own regulations once again government is imposing policy without any legislative underpinning and using extra legal means to do so enforcing the whims of particular ministers on the threat of arrest rather than applying statute is the very antithesis of the rule of law it reveals a government floundering in policy and governance uncertainty and inconsistency in the face of an economic meltdown president emmerson mnangagwa repeatedly says zimbabwe s door is open to foreign investors any company stepping through this door in such a climate will have difficult questions to answer from shareholders dm

against the dollar for eight years which means industries that have a high component of domestic input are affected by imports and contraband the fiscal deficit has been rising for six years since the boom in commodity prices ended and it closed at seven per cent of gdp last year this as well as low private investment a sharp decline in currency reserves the increase in public debt with still low international prices and an economy dependent on commodities are causing tensions in bolivia s economic policy said juan pablo bohoslavsky the united nations independent expert on foreign debt and human rights the fixed exchange rate to control inflation leads to an increase in import prices and a growing deficit in the balance of payments he said bolivia s external debt rose in march to us 10 billion or about 25 per cent of the country s gdp but central bank president pablo ramos discarded the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency the purchasing power depends on the level of prices we have low inflation about 0 6 per cent in 2019 ramos told the associated press this price stability guarantees purchasing power and we must maintain it a few months ago morales said the economy was shielded but his economy minister luis arce recently acknowledged that brazil s crisis will affect bolivia brazil remains bolivia s top market for energy but exports to the region s largest country have plunged due to lower demand and declining fields official reports say that exports fell from a peak of 31 million cubic meters a day of natural gas in 2014 to 23 8 million cubic metres a day in 2017 still the bolivian government remains optimistic and is betting on continuity since morales took office in 2006 the economy has grown by an annual average of about 4 5 per cent well above the regional average and the international monetary fund says it will grow at four per cent this year experts however warn that growth is largely dependent on savings and external credits from china while the us 15 1 billion in international reserves reached in 2014 plunged to us 8 billion last march morales is credited for his pragmatic economic stewardship that spread bolivia s natural gas and mineral wealth among the masses but he has lost support following allegations of manipulating the justice system corruption scandals and his insistence in running for a fourth term in office bolivia s long governing president warns that if he is not re elected in october bolivia could break with its recent run of stability and return to a past of economic turmoil influenced by the policies of international organisations before the world bank and the international monetary fund decided the economic destiny of bolivia morales recently said on twitter today our people decide their own future ap
the international monetary fund and the search for the master of politics and finance who will be its next chief imagine the scene you re the president of a small country with an economy just about ticking over when something goes horribly wrong maybe your tourist dependent island paradise suffers a terrorist attack and thousands cancel their flights maybe a neighbouring country invades maybe you ve just made a few mistakes along the way and inadvertently created a bubble which bursts recession turns to crisis your country can t service its debts and pay its bills you re struggling to fix your economic woes and stop a desperate population from rioting all while keeping the lights on what are you going to do who are you going to turn to for the short term cold hard cash you need you need to borrow the world s credit card you need an imf bailout what is the imf the international monetary fund was established in the wake of the second world war to help global economic recovery it now has 189 member nations and a mandate to foster global monetary cooperation secure financial stability facilitate international trade promote high employment and sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty around the world but it is best known for providing loans to countries in crisis and there s no such thing as free money there are strings attached often drastic economic reforms known as structural adjustment demanding the privatisation of public services deregulation of private industry and the dropping of trade barriers as such the imf comes in for a lot of criticism us economist jeffrey sachs famously said its usual prescription is budgetary belt tightening to countries who are much too poor to own belts it also comes under fire from the right who argue that nations will pursue vote winning but economically irresponsible policies knowing the imf will bail them out if or when it all goes pear shaped and having to lead an organisation like this having to carry such responsibility attempting to put out fires while invoicing for the hosepipe being both rescuer and disciplinarian all while facing daily denunciations on all sides who would want a job like that well it turns out loads of people do what makes a good imf chief with christine lagarde the current managing director of the imf set to be named the new head of the european central bank speculation as to her replacement is rife chris hafner is executive director of professional services firm grovelands and a global strategy expert in leadership given the current state of global uncertainty and complex international relations the managing director must be an oasis of calm and pragmatism he told al jazeera hafner s colleague mark davies chairman of grovelands an expert in international financial services and a former partner at deloitte says a sense of vision is key managing director of the imf is a big job a tough job and an important job a tremendous communicator both politically and in the media and able to take a far sighted view of markets and fiscal policy so who could do it incoming managers must be aged 65 or younger which rules out 71 year old mario draghi who is leaving the european central bank to make room for lagarde without an imf rule change a straight job swap is unlikely under an informal agreement the head of the world bank is always from the united states while the imf chief is always a european part of the post wwii dealmaking that while possibly arcane is still in effect there is no shortage of talented europeans to run the imf said augusto lopez claros a former director the world bank s global indicators group he named sweden s stefan ingves and erkki liikanen a fin i am also sure that benoit coeure a french member of the ecb board would have strong support said lopez claros and of course it would not surprise me in the least if jens weidmann the head of the bundesbank was strongly supported by germany weidmann 51 has been hotly tipped for the imf job having lost out on the coveted ecb presidency to lagarde what might count against him is his being regarded as a dyed in the wool economist and not a politician said dr steve mccabe of birmingham city university but the german is very happy with his current job and not looking to apply elsewhere a spokesman told bloomberg on thursday brexit britain seeking spotlight there s no reason to think the next imf managing director will be a central banker in europe said political scientist professor michele chang of the college of europe in bruges neither dominique strauss kahn nor rodrigo rato the two chiefs before lagarde were central bankers the role of central banker tends to be a wonkier job whereas the imf needs a certain diplomatic capacity might we therefore see another politician being appointed this is where the uk might cause a surprise there has never been a british imf chief but following brexit and the rise of populist rhetoric on this sceptred isle set in the silver sea there is both a perception and a literal reality that brits are turning their backs on multilateral institutions 190702095409348 the imf is a genuinely world wide organisation said mark davies of grovelands a uk candidate would help the uk show that we are internationalist in outlook and ready to play our role on the global stage carney vs osborne but who would the uk nominate one candidate is obvious mark carney a canadian with irish and british citizenship has been at the helm of the bank of england for the past six years with a reputation as a sensible steady hand on the tiller he is due to leave the bank in january the other potential candidate making headlines in the uk is a little less obvious none other than former chancellor george osborne now editor of the london evening standard he claims to have support from within both the us and china mr carney certainly has the technical expertise wide experience and credibility to take on the imf job said lopez claros his earlier stints as governor of the bank of canada and chairman of the financial stability board would make him an extremely competitive candidate with an edge over mr osborne in terms of relevant experience in fact osborne s political experience may hurt his chances lagarde was very good on the inequality agenda said mccabe whereas osborne spent years in the uk presiding over a doctrine of austerity and this may count against him carney provides a bridge between the uk us and europe said hafner he also has the proven temperament having navigated the devaluation of sterling through the brexit referendum osborne on the other hand has found his way through political experience rather than economic experience while a strong personality i think his chances are slim a break with tradition all the talk so far has been of men and men of a certain hue taking on the imf role but what about dame minouche shafik the egyptian born british american economist surely with all her accomplishments she would make a strong contender she became the world bank s youngest vice president at the age of 36 then permanent secretary of the uk s department for international development deputy managing director of the imf and deputy governor of the bank of england most names being discussed are male said mccabe and in a world where we want to be increasing diversity at top levels this might be one of the considerations it s a plum job the europeans will want to keep hold of it but this could yet be a break with tradition beyond europe potential non european candidates said mccabe could include india s raghuram rajan a former imf chief economist and current governor of the reserve bank of india or credit suisse ceo tidjane thiam of the ivory coast mohamed el erian the egyptian american former ceo of investment giant pimco would also be an attractive candidate on this last name chris hafner agrees he has the temperament and experience to lead the imf in these times of global economic uncertainty and volatility he told al jazeera he provides a bridge between the east and the west his education is unquestionably enviable and he has previous imf experience to me he embodies both inwardly and outwardly what the imf represents he is likely the best alternative to a traditional european selection which may help the imf avoid being seen as favouring one side of the brexit debate over the other how about someone from china truly a global powerhouse augusto lopez claros thinks it unlikely especially as china has held one of the imf s number two spots for a decade i think it is unlikely that the membership is currently ready to give the top imf job to anyone other than a candidate with relevant experience running some important aspect of a market economy with an open trade system and fully developed financial markets including a convertible currency and an open capital account he said it s an unpredictable world says mccabe whoever takes this role over they face a difficult time in our history he said brexit a trade war china s expansionism growing inequality but when is it not a difficult time
normally the doer of a good deed expects just a thank you but usually someone is adversely affected by the good deed for example saving someone s life from a criminal is a good deed but the criminal now has reason to punish you for the act echoes conway tutani no good deed goes unpunished normally the doer of a good deed expects just a thank you but usually someone is adversely affected by the good deed for example saving someone s life from a criminal is a good deed but the criminal now has reason to punish you for the act that s exactly what s happening in zimbabwe with some people siding with criminals who have been tormenting them by expressing anger and hostility against finance minister mthuli ncube s de dollarisation of the economy which as seen in the past week is actually working in their favour while the intense and rabid hostility coming from speculative economic saboteurs against ncube s de dollarisation of the economy is expected because they have been making a killing from it it is the support for these criminals from a section of ordinary zimbabweans who have been the main victims of these criminals that is most irrational de dollarisation has released ordinary zimbabweans from the vice like grip of these speculators but weirdly some of the victims are siding with those bloodsuckers and threatening to hold a massive demonstration for redollarisation of the economy we saw this warped mentality this past week when some zimbabweans rushed to laugh and mock after south african power utility eskom initially said it had not as earlier announced by the zimbabwean government received the us 10 million payment to partially offset the us 33 outstanding power import bill but then these same people are crying foul that they are being subjected to darkness for 18 hours a day because of the very same unsettled power import bill choose what you want because you can t have it both ways trenchantly observed fellow zimbabwean lawrence hoba we are becoming ridiculous and stupid as well the very person who doesn t want things to work is the one who is most affected ncube observed this week i know of one specific company that was now borrowing domestic rtgs dollars and using the borrowings to take positions on foreign currency they would make some us dollars put the us dollars in their foreign currency account and then start all over again why because we had a negative real interest rate regime so we said let s close the gap and deal with speculation yes elementary but decisive of course ncube is not the daft fool they make him out to be so he pulled a fast one on these smart alecs by de dollarising when they least expected it he outsmarted outwitted out thought them but outmanoeuvring someone is not a crime and when you intend to outmanouevre someone you don t tell them that that s what you intend to do that s why businessman and presidential advisory council member shingi munyeza this week said that informing speculators in advance about de dollarisation would have been akin to police revealing plans to entrap criminals said ncube when dealing with a currency you do not call for a referendum especially in the face of a speculative attack which was going on you move swiftly with decisiveness this is how a sensitive issue has to be managed but you have to give signals that it will happen at some point and we tried to do this yes more than enough signals were given but ncube s critics were not listening because like a mutual admiration society a group of people with superior airs who routinely express consideration esteem and support for one another to the point of exaggeration and pretense while viewing those outsiders their circles as beyond stupid they were busy ridiculing him among themselves until it hit them like a bolt from the blue last week so far these smart alecs have been proved wrong as observed by economist persistence gwanya who does not belong to a mutual admiration society on the other extreme there are those who were greatly opposed to the zimdollar introduction and predicted its implosion from the very beginning these have been proved wrong as the local currency has actually strengthened barely three days after its introduction the zimdollar sharply appreciated to an average of 1 8 from as low as 1 13 which saw rate convergence at some banks of course the economy has many moving parts but this is a hopeful beginning thus it does not need rocket science to that the much hyped current court case filed by a harare lawyer against de dollarisation is another exercise in futility because more and more people are embracing the local currency making it a fait accompli it has already happened leaving people with no option but to accept it after all mdc alliance vice president tendai biti s case against the 2 electronic transaction tax came to nothing and that much maligned tax has played a big role in ensuring fiscal surplus which fundamental has helped in ensuring a strong zimdollar replaces the us dollar regime which as trenchantly observed by economist eddie cross had become a ponzi scheme built on ever increasing prices also one of the lines of reasoning being used to attack ncube is infantile and silly the attack goes you banish the zimdollar for the multi currency system in order to stabilise the economy how then do you abandon the same multi currency system to stabilise the economy that s their repeatable two liner you hear on the streets commuter omnibuses and many public spaces which give an outlet to buffoonery hot air and misinformation but on scrutiny it amounts to nothing this is of course a crude oversimplification and the reason is obvious to make ncube look most stupid in the eyes of the gullible and the ignorant among us and they are many oversimplification is a statement or argument that leaves out relevant considerations about an issue such as unintended long term consequences and changed circumstances necessitating changing direction every solution creates its own problems the point leaders looking for solutions that won t at some point bring more problems to be overcome are deluding themselves thus oversimplification leaves out so many details such as that as observed by ncube if you go back to 2008 it is the exact opposite we had no fiscal discipline we had no monetary sector discipline we are now in a far better position than we were back then we are re engaging with the rest of the world it s plain to see that one the circumstances have changed from 2009 with the international monetary fund now involved with its staff monitored programme to ensure adherence to fiscal and monetary best practices and two that dollarisation has come with its own unintended consequences as outlined by biti ironically one of ncube sternest critics who observed the us dollar is not sustainable for a number of reasons it is overpriced so it makes our exports so expensive and it also makes the core structure of our economy so expensive biti said the us dollar has revalued in the last two years which makes it so unbearable for the zimbabwean economy in the last two years alone the us dollar has revalued by 19 it is uncompetitive for a small economy like ours the us dollar is not only uncompetititive but also enslaving so as zimbabwean commentator takura zhangazha has piercingly observed we must stop treating the us dollar as a deity as some god as something divine last week russia and china agreed to ditch the us dollar in favour of trade in the russian ruble and chinese yuan this long overdue bold move against american imperialism where the us imposes sanctions on any country at any time will make the world a more equal and just political and socio economic place this shows zimbabwe is not crazy to outlaw the us dollar in domestic transactions so instead of being made to demonstrate for strangulating redollarisation as the zimbabwe congress of trade unions and its sidekicks are senselessly calling for people should be shouting free free at last

share 380 million africans could soon share a single currency 380 million africans could soon share a single currency african countries should heed the lessons of the euro before embarking on monetary union african countries should heed the lessons of the euro before embarking on monetary union monetary stability in africa would be welcome but it won t be a panacea the project for a single currency in africa seems closer than ever the fifteen countries of the economic community of west african states ecowas recently agreed to abandon their monetary sovereignty in 2020 and introduce a new common currency the eco this isn t the first shared currency in post colonial africa the cfa franc is now used by around 150 million people in fourteen african countries most of which are former french colonies yet the eco differs from the cfa franc in three crucial aspects first the cfa franc is currently pegged to the euro which reduces the autonomy of national central banks to conduct monetary policy in contrast the eco is expected to be managed by a single central bank with capacity to make monetary policy decisions under an inflation targeting regime second there doesn t exist a single monetary union encompassing all cfa franc users instead there are two different currencies that go under the same name the west african cfa franc and the central african cfa franc by comparison the eco will be the single currency of fifteen countries bringing together 380 million citizens under a common monetary framework finally and most importantly the new monetary union will include the largest economy in africa nigeria there are many potential advantages to the new monetary union for one thing as the eurozone countries have generally found a shared currency led by an autonomous central bank tends to keep inflation under control in the twenty years prior to joining the euro spain s inflation rate averaged 8 5 per cent as opposed to 2 per cent between 1999 and 2018 furthermore trade under a common currency becomes more efficient as exchange rate related costs disappear boosting commercial transactions among members it is estimated that trade between eurozone countries increased by between 5 and 20 per cent after the introduction of the euro another positive aspect of a monetary union is that it prevents members from resorting to continuous currency devaluations to become more competitive externally forcing them to introduce productivity boosting reforms to achieve the same objective as the euro has also shown a single currency also has some significant drawbacks countries with fragile institutions might be tempted to take advantage of lower financing costs resulting from sharing currency with higher credibility countries incentivising them to increase their fiscal deficits and public debt the most dramatic example of this greece joined the euro bringing about a debt crisis that threatened the integrity of the entire eurozone in addition a monetary union has short term costs countries willing to join the eco must meet some convergence criteria aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability these criteria aren t very different from those contained in the maastricht treaty ecowas demands that members maintain a fiscal deficit no higher of 3 per cent of gdp and inflation rate of below 5 per cent a stable exchange rate and a public debt below 70 per cent of gdp among other things unfortunately no ecowas country has been able to fulfil all criteria in recent years which suggests that the 2020 deadline might have to be postponed once again it is no surprise that those ecowas economies that currently share a common currency the cfa franc already meet most of these requirements whereas countries with monetary sovereignty have struggled to get their house in order a monetary union with an independent central bank that carries out a price stability orientated monetary policy is a conditio sine qua non for african countries to pave the way for economic growth however monetary stability isn t a panacea the euro experiment shows that countries need much more than a stable currency to continue growing and increasing the living standards of the population ecowas countries will have to implement structural reforms aimed at reinforcing their political and economic institutions attracting foreign investments and creating a business friendly atmosphere that allows entrepreneurs to develop all their potential only then will the engine of fast economic growth that has worked so well for asian countries pull african countries out of the poverty trap they have been immersed in for decades in any case the eco represents a significant improvement on the status quo where highly politicised national central banks struggle to conduct monetary policy in an independent manner time will tell if the new currency succeeds to achieve its objectives or is just another failed experiment on the bumpy road to prosperity

watch now former texas rep beto o rourke s viability has become a giant question mark in the 2020 presidential race in 2018 his impassioned senate campaign against republican incumbent ted cruz made him a national democratic celebrity and a fund raising sensation he narrowly lost but months later launched a white house bid that for his backers evoked memories of barack obama a dozen years earlier so far however o rourke has lost momentum rather than gained it he remains mired in single digits among democratic primary voters nationally and in the crucial early states of the nomination contest the breakout moment of his first debate came at his expense when fellow texan julian castro chided him for not doing your homework on an immigration issue yet the one time punk musician and small business owner 46 still displays the charisma and youthful energy in town hall gatherings with voters that have become his signature he has built substantial campaign teams in early states such as iowa and south carolina in search of a summer kick start o rourke sat down with editor at large john harwood at el paso s l j café to discuss his campaign and his views on the economy what follows is a condensed edited transcript of their discussion john harwood a couple weeks ago i was with you in iowa a woman introduced you there and meant it to be a compliment she said beto o rourke is a blank slate that we can project our hopes and dreams onto is that lack of definition a problem for your campaign beto o rourke i hope what she meant by that was beto o rourke has shown up to our community to listen to us and he came not just to tell us everything that he s going to do for this country but to bring every single one of us into the solutions and not just to his solutions to our solutions so you know in some of these smaller more rural communities in iowa i m listening to farmers who understand rural policy and agricultural policy better than i ever could comin from el paso they want me to come in and acknowledge the challenge and then ask them how we meet that challenge together john harwood but do you think that you have defined in a clear way for people why you re running and what your core idea is beto o rourke you just met my daughter molly i was telling you about my kids ulysses and henry her brothers they re counting on me and they re counting on us at this moment earlier today we were in a shelter in ciudad juarez where this country through the current administration has turned back asylum seekers throughout their most desperate and vulnerable moments who are penniless and frightened who are prey to those who will try to take advantage of them in juarez because we the wealthiest the most powerful country one comprised of immigrants asylum seekers and refugees cannot find the political will to do the right thing all that is on my conscience and it s the judgment of my kids that i fear i want to make sure that we sit up to do the right thing when it comes to separated families and kids who ve been locked up when it comes to a system of health care in this country where tens of millions are unable to get the care they need to be well enough to live to their best the challenge of climate which is consuming entire communities and going to get exponentially worse if we don t change course i want to make sure that we re up to this moment not one party not half the country all of us are brought into the solutions the way that i m running this campaign the way that i ve always served the way that we ran in texas was to write nobody off take no one for granted bring everybody in that s the only way you could beat trump the only way you beat these other challenges that we face john harwood let me ask you about definition with respect to the economy i was on your website clicked on the issue tab there wasn t a listing for the economy and i wonder why that is you re a small business guy beto o rourke absolutely i think about the fact that we ve organized ourselves in a capitalist economy and so capital is central to a person s success and yet so many perspective entrepreneurs have been locked out of any access to capital it might be where they were raised who their folks are the chances they ve had in their life might also be the color of their skin and the fact that they ve been redlined out of access to that democratic presidential candidate beto o rourke speaks with cnbc s john harwood mary catherine wellons cnbc john harwood but why isn t there an economic tab there beto o rourke we ll get it fixed on the website it s obviously fundamental to our success as a country more people having the chance to become small business owners and create jobs and offer their services and their food to the folks in this community and this country but also making sure that we acknowledge that there are people who are on the outside looking in to the world s greatest economy with no meaningful way to participate who might be paid 7 25 an hour the minimum wage and so therefore are working a second or even a third job to make ends meet for themselves or for their kids you have states like mine in texas where you have a so called right to work that denies people the right to organize and to use their leverage and the value that they bring to the workforce to exact better working conditions better wages better services i want to make sure that we change all of that and we change that for the better and bring every single person into this economy then it really works john harwood the big divide in the campaign is between people like say elizabeth warren who say we need deep fundamental structural change in how corporations are run and our tax system in our regulatory system and those who say we can move more slowly and more incrementally it feels to me as if you are trying to straddle those two things beto o rourke i feel like i m just trying to do the right thing i m listening to people who are trying to make ends meet hearing from teachers in a kindergarten classroom that some kids at the age of five are already ten months behind in reading comprehension i bet you that those are the kids of parents who are working two or three jobs to make ends meet and don t have the luxury as amy and i have had to read to our kids before the first day of kindergarten or first grade so all this stuff is connected so when we call for expanding public education so that we have pre k universally for every child in every part of the country it s addressing that when we re talking about a 15 an hour minimum wage it is also addressing that when we talk about guaranteed high quality universal healthcare it is addressing that that child s ability to be well enough to learn during that next day of school and all these are things that i ve heard from people all over this country so i don t know where you want to fix me on the political spectrum or relative to the other candidates i just don t define myself in opposition to them but instead in terms of what i want to achieve john harwood at the debate the other night you got a question about the 70 tax rate and you didn t say that was too high you didn t say it was about right or too low why not beto o rourke i should have it s too high i think in my 60 seconds of trying to get an answer in and trying to root my answer in the fundamental inequality of this economy and the inability of far too many of our fellow americans to be included in this economy which is you know central to anything else that we re going to address including the tax rate i didn t answer the direct question so if you re asking me no i don t think we should have a 70 tax rate john harwood what sounds right to you beto o rourke i think you at a minimum roll back the worst elements of the trump tax cuts so the top marginal tax rate back up to 39 if you were to do that and in addition make some other structural changes to our tax code the corporate tax rate which was brought down from 35 to 21 bring that back up to 28 great place to start and as you probably know you generate hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years if you were to tax capital at the same rate that you tax ordinary wage income like the waiters who are working here you also get to some greater structural correction to a very unequal economy and you generate the revenue necessary john harwood you mean capital gains and dividends beto o rourke absolutely and i want to make sure that i get this point across you generate the revenue that you need to pay for the investments in education in health care in the affordability of college but you also reduce the concentration of wealth and power and privilege that really defines this age in america in a way that we haven t seen since the last gilded age of more than 100 years ago both are necessary to ensure that this democracy this country will work for everybody if you increase a wealth tax at the inter generational transfer of wealth within families more so than john harwood you mean the estate tax and the step up basis beto o rourke absolutely you tax at the real value of that given asset not just you know john harwood so you d get rid of the step up basis watch now beto o rourke absolutely if you also look at where we re spending money today and how we ve accrued the debt and the current deficit that we re running it s inescapable that the wars that we have waged and the fact that we ve been in iraq for example for the last 28 years and afghanistan for 18 years and in so many other countries around the planet ending those wars bringing those service members back home finding peaceful non violent diplomatic resolution to our foreign policy priorities also produces an extraordinary savings which could be directed towards investments that we want to make in this country infrastructure education health care the things that will make this country stronger and allow more people to participate in the economy john harwood you proposed a tax the other day to fund veterans initiatives to tax families that do not have family members in service when i talked to economists they thought that s awfully complicated what constitutes service how far does family reach is that a fully baked idea beto o rourke yeah right now we ve asked fewer than 1 of our fellow americans to serve in the wars since 9 11 and the financial cost of that we placed on this country s credit card to be borne by this and future generations what i m proposing is that the next time we decide to go to war we fully pay for all the costs of that war including making sure that we ve made investments in the care for veterans who will have borne the battle those americans who served in vietnam waited 40 years for this country to treat exposure to agent orange as a presumptive condition for the cancers that they were dying from meaning for four decades the va provided no meaningful help to hundreds of thousands of our fellow americans it s been 28 years since gulf war veterans were exposed to toxins that led to a gulf war illness i want to make sure that we re investing right up front when we go to those wars and the money is deposited in a veterans trust fund john harwood but have you and the economic advisors you re relying on thought through how you define what families are exempt does your dad count or is it just your kid beto o rourke if you are a veteran if you re an active duty service member you re not going to pay into this veterans trust fund because you ve already paid with your life if you re an immediate family member in that household because we know that when someone from a household serves this country and goes to war everybody in that household serves this country and goes to war so your spouse is not subject to this tax it ensures that those who have already paid the price are recognized for their service those who are currently paying it by being deployed have an investment made to ensure that we re there to meet them when they come back we re going to spare no expense bear any burden but that the other americans who have been able to not have to bear the costs of these wars have to contribute something as well beyond generating the revenues we need to pay for the services that those veterans have earned here s what else it does i hope it causes us to pause before we go into the next war because we look at the full accounting and cost for what it really takes to pay for not just the bombs and bullets and the deployments but those veterans who return over the course of their lives the ptsd tbi military sexual trauma that they incur in service to this country making sure that we re there for them when they come back watch now john harwood as a member of generation x do you subscribe to the argument that baby boomers as a generation have made selfish policy choices that cut their own taxes that ran up debt that emphasized consumption rather than resolving a lot of problems beto o rourke no i mean if we get to pointing fingers at different generations or blaming our fellow americans based on a difference in age or geography or really anything else we just further divide an already polarized country john harwood but when you think about the tremendous liability the government has when this very large baby boom generation retires and the fact that there are fewer workers to pay the taxes to support those benefits as they retire do you see an issue of generational justice in that or injustice beto o rourke i see an opportunity for us to figure out the answers to some pretty significant challenges posed by this generation retiring you know within 15 years it s very possible on this current trajectory that social security no longer pays 100 of its obligation to our fellow americans who ve worked every single day of their lives and paid into the social security trust fund john harwood so you d raise the social security tax cap beto o rourke yeah you can blame the previous generation or you can do the sensible thing and raise the cap john harwood do you eliminate it altogether beto o rourke eliminate it altogether and make sure that that fund is solvent not just to the next generation but into the next century and then look we spend a lot of time listening to those who are concerned about or energized over immigration and we think about very often the threats or the challenges that it poses immigrants are coming to this country traveling thousands of miles for the honor of picking and preparing our food so that we can feed ourselves doing jobs that your kids and my kids are more likely than not not going to do in this country and they re an extraordinary opportunity for us to meet our responsibility to successive generations in terms of paying in to this social safety net and make sure that it works john harwood trump has proposed cutting levels of legal immigration in half you ve proposed raising visa caps how much higher do you think legal immigration should go beto o rourke we have millions of unfilled jobs in this country for which we cannot find labor that was born in this country now in some instances that s a mismatch of skills and training and education so i also call for ensuring that we invest in community colleges investing in the ability for unions and apprenticeships to meet that gap but many of those jobs will only be filled by those who are willing to come to this country and to work those jobs john harwood a million people a year come in legally now should we double that beto o rourke i think we should significantly increase it i think that should be a conversation with small owners like those here at the l j cafe farmers ranchers producers all over this country immigrant families and communities small town america whose very vitality depends on the willingness of immigrants to come to this country making this a much more vibrant stronger more successful country than we would otherwise be watch now john harwood let me ask you about your experience as a small businessman both the web services company and the alt weekly do you look upon that as a success and what do you take from it as you think about the economic challenges of the country beto o rourke i do look at it as a success to be able with good friends far more talented smarter than i was to come together and create opportunity and jobs in the third poorest urban county in the united states high value high skill high tech jobs that felt really good it was really hard to do i had some advantages that other americans don t and i ll give you an example i could not get a loan in 1998 to start a technology company in el paso just didn t have the assets that the bank would lend against but my dad who had a home that was fully paid for could take out a loan on his home and then lend that money back to me 20 000 that was the seed capital that allowed us to start a business that ultimately hired dozens of our fellow el pasoans and served clients all over this country john harwood which reflects the wealth disparities that make it so difficult for some too beto o rourke absolutely the fact that there s ten times the wealth in white america than there is in black america that many black americans literally were drawn out of the ability to get a home loan and buy a home and build equity against which they could borrow to ensure that next generation their son or daughter could start a small business the more i listen to people and travel the country the more exceptional my experience seems to have been and the more it helps to explain the lack of dynamism that we see among small businesses right now as you consolidate more power in corporations more market share among fewer companies when you have fewer opportunities to be able to borrow or to lend out at a community level you re really stifling opportunity for so many so i would love more of my fellow americans to have the same opportunity i had to be an entrepreneur to create jobs and opportunity john harwood were you good at it i know that the weekly went out of business but was the web services company profitable beto o rourke yeah it it s still in business today i don t know how many businesses make it past the 20 year mark but stanton street is still going john harwood you didn t get rich off of it beto o rourke i didn t get rich off of it no and that was never my goal and it wasn t what drove me in fact the most exciting part of the business was the news part we started an online newspaper covering city hall arts and culture and the u s mexico relationship i moved back here in 98 and i found this to be the most fascinating exciting place on the planet and i wanted to tell our story i made the brilliant decision in quotes to move from an online only version in the late 90s to print just as the economy and industry was going in the exact opposite direction but really proud of the writing and the reporting and our coverage of city hall and politics and policy in el paso i really think we helped to deepen and improve the conversation and lead to some better policy outcomes in the communities watch now john harwood one of the issues that s gotten bigger and bigger in our politics are the pros and cons of gentrification you dealt with that in el paso on a development project that had some resistance and you got some blowback for that what did you learn that you can apply going forward about how government ought to balance the interests of what may look to most people as economic progress but has concentrated costs on a small number of people beto o rourke i was on the city council at a time that our downtown had for all intents and purposes died the core of our community the center of our city was not alive and it was hard to retain and attract talent to create economic growth and development and make this a city that young people wanted to be in there was a really ambitious plan to correct that but what i learned when we introduced that plan and then i knocked on the doors of those people who lived within the area of the plan was it did not meet all of their needs including protecting them against being priced out of their apartments and their homes so based on their feedback i helped to change the plan to ensure that affordability was a fundamental component of the downtown plan affordability for housing was defined as a function of income that no more than 30 of what you earn would be paid in rent or mortgage or living expenses and what i think that helped to do in large part was to retain the ability for people whether they lived in south el paso or the communities that ring downtown el paso to stay there john harwood but even if you make concessions like that you can t make everybody happy is that ok you ve got to at some point say no the entire city needs this we re going to go forward beto o rourke i think you have to do everything within your power to ensure that those who will be most affected by a given policy decision are protected and benefit from that decision especially those in communities that very often are overlooked or neglected or are forgotten altogether john harwood is what gets referred to as gentrification a bad thing beto o rourke yeah it is when folks who for generations have defined the character and the success of a neighborhood or a community are pushed out because they can no longer afford to be in that community that s a bad thing and it s a bad thing that s happening in communities all over the united states right now john harwood the same principle applies to the issue of trade trade expansion is broadly good for the economy it has diffuse benefits for most people but concentrated costs for some people in industries adversely affected you were for trade promotion authority but now you say you would have been against trans pacific partnership are you trying to have it both ways beto o rourke this community got hit harder than almost any other community in the united states after the passage of the north american free trade agreement i think there were officially 29 000 trade adjusted job losses that literally picked up stakes and moved right across the river to ciudad juarez however in the intervening years and decades we have become a trade hub so now one out of every four jobs in el paso is connected to u s mexico trade it literally drives the economy of the community that are represented in texas so i m going to fiercely protect those jobs that we have in place but i m also going to remember the lessons learned from nafta i wanted to make sure that president obama had the authority necessary to negotiate the best possible deal for the united states all of the goals and all of the motives were noble but here in mexico an economy with which we are joined literally at the hip to deny the ability to organize which would improve labor conditions working standards and incomes in juarez and consequently would put the american worker on a more level playing field was a serious sin of omission in that plan what i would do in my administration i d make sure that we were able to conduct trade negotiations with all of these pacific partners but that we prioritize those labor standards environmental standards and human rights standards so that free trade becomes fair trade watch now

economic releases will be somewhat sparser in the coming week but there will be several key data to keep an eye on as well as central bank activity that could shape expectations of future monetary policy the bank of canada meets for its latest policy decision and will probably resist making a dovish tilt while the minutes of the federal reserve s and the european central bank s last policy meetings will be watched for clues on their upcoming decisions later this month chinese exports probably fell back in june as us and chinese officials make preparations to restart trade talks trade numbers out of china on friday will come under the spotlight amid signs the world s second largest economy may require further stimulus to stave off a deep slowdown chinese exports unexpectedly rose by 1 1 year on year in may though this was mostly due to the frontloading of shipments from the latest round of tariffs imposed by the united states they are forecast to have declined by 2 y y in june a bigger drop would accentuate worries about the economy and add to calls for more policy easing another indication of the strength of the chinese economy will come from june producer prices due on wednesday the producer price index is forecast to fall to just 0 2 y y suggesting weak demand for factory goods and raw materials the consumer price index will also be released on wednesday a disappointing set of figures could pressure the yuan a little but not so much the australian dollar often seen as a better liquid proxy for the yuan as china is the main destination for australian exports the aussie has been benefiting from higher iron ore prices and narrowing negative spreads between australian and us yields so is likely to hold firm unless china s trade stats cause a major deterioration in risk sentiment machinery orders coming up in japan machinery orders will be the main release in japan which will kick off the week on monday despite the ongoing trade uncertainty and weakening overseas demand japanese machinery orders were up for the third straight month in april industrial production has also steadied after plunging in january the final reading for industrial output in may is out on friday and before that corporate goods prices will be viewed on wednesday the not so gloomy economic picture in japan probably explains why the bank of japan is not in any hurry yet to join its counterparts in signalling looser policy one area of concern though for the boj is the deterioration in earnings which have been falling throughout 2019 the may figure is out on tuesday and another annual drop would not bode well for consumer demand hence growth but until the boj sends out explicit signals of policy easing the yen will likely continue to appreciate against its peers as most other central banks move towards or have moved in cutting rates will ecb minutes pave way for rate cut apart from industrial output numbers the european calendar will be relatively light next week putting the focus on the ecb s june meeting minutes at the start of the week the market s attention will fall on the german economy as industrial output and trade data will be released on monday the eurozone wide industrial production figures will follow on friday the bloc s manufacturing sector particularly germany s continues to struggle as trade tensions weigh on business investment and disrupt global supply chains and with the trump administration seeking to expand the trade fight to more countries including the european union instead of looking to end it the eurozone s outlook has grown dimmer this has forced the ecb to rethink its policy normalization plans as inflation has also moderated at the june meeting the ecb refrained from adopting a clear loosening bias even though president draghi did say some members raised the possibility of a rate cut the account of that meeting to be published on thursday should throw some insight into those discussions although there have been several signals since the june meeting including from draghi himself that additional stimulus may be on the cards a dovish account could still pressure the euro which this week slipped back below 1 13 on declining eurozone bond yields uk may data could point to q2 contraction the uk s growth outlook is not looking any better either lately and the economy probably underperformed its european partners in the second quarter as the brexit extension has only prolonged the period of uncertainty for british businesses uk gdp shrank by 0 4 month on month in april and data due on wednesday is forecast to show gdp recovering by 0 3 in may both industrial and manufacturing output also slumped in april as firms sought to run down the large stockpiles they built in the prior month in may they re expected to have rebounded by 1 5 and 2 5 m m respectively if the numbers indicate the uk economy likely contracted in the second quarter this would further hinder the bank of england s intension to raise interest rates in the next 12 months even if there is a smooth brexit markets already think the next move will be down having priced a more than 50 probability of a cut by december

be of much significance to investors pricing of a rate reduction by the fed at the end of this month weaker than expected figures would only reinforce the view that the us central bank will ease

cut were to changing their inclination bank of canada to stand pat things have perked up lately for the canadian economy as inflation has overshot expectations and gdp growth has accelerated higher oil prices have also improved canada s growth prospects as well as the canadian dollar s normally the bank of canada would not have hesitated to hike rates under such conditions however with the global economy slowing down and other central banks switching to a dovish stance the boc will probably decide to hold monetary policy steady for the time being the bank is widely anticipated to keep rates at 1 75 at it s meeting on wednesday and futures markets see only about a 20 probability of lower rates by december with the bank s announcement statement not expected to give much away investors will be looking at stephen poloz s press conference and the quarterly monetary policy report for more clues on what direction the boc will take in the coming months in the meantime the greenback s declining yield advantage has driven the loonie to eight month highs as interest rates in the us could soon fall below those in canada

people in zimbabwe are worried about what could happen if their livelihoods are tied to the country s new currency harare zimbabwe the move was bold and many did not see it coming in a bid to defend the new and fledgling zimbabwean dollar against black market speculation the country s finance minister on june 25 outlawed using united states dollars and other foreign currencies in local transactions when news of the policy broke harare based independent economist john robertson thought it was a bad practical joke i am not fully convinced it s genuine robertson told al jazeera this idea is so bad it s a cause for concern i fear it may be an attempt in government to cause someone embarrassment we hope it is revised zimbabwe s finance minister mthuli ncube had hinted on several occasions that a new zimbabwean dollar was in the works the country had already made a move toward it earlier this year when it introduced an interim currency the real time gross settlement rtgs dollar or zimdollar but a decade after devastating hyperinflation prompted the country to dollarise its economy by allowing the us greenback and other foreign currencies to be used as legal tender many zimbabweans are sceptical about the stability of the country s new currency and worried about what could happen if their livelihoods are tied to it not even six months old the fledgling zimdollar has suffered from speculative attacks that saw its value plummet by more than 150 percent before recovering for 67 year old david mkono the country s new currency has just added to his myriad problems mkono worked as a boilerman for zimbabwe s power utility company for 47 years paying into his pension in us dollars from 2009 until he retired last year at retirement i was going to get 223 per month i am not sure how much i am going to get now with the new changes mkono told al jazeera i really don t know how to value this because i don t know what 223 is now in rtgs some economists see zimbabwe s swift outlawing of the us dollar as justified given most countries that dollarise their economies fail to successfully reintroduce a new local currency it s a chance to disprove the notion that once an economy dollarises it can t have its currency ever many countries have failed kipson gundani a harare based economist and executive director of the ceo africa roundtable told al jazeera while dollarisation can help stabilise an economy in the throes of hyperinflation there are drawbacks local currencies are a powerful symbol of sovereignty and national identity countries that dollarise also lose the power to directly influence their own economy through monetary policy but zimbabwe s economy is not exactly fertile ground for a new currency to take root the country is likely in recession and the international monetary fund predicts the economy could contract 5 2 percent his year industry is operating at less than half of its installed capacity reliance on imports which become more expensive as the local currency weakens is stubbornly high mkono who has two children aged 12 and 8 says soaring inflation is already making it difficult for him to provide food for his family the prices have gone up rapidly in the shops he said when i get my monthly allowance we realise that we can t buy basic things like mielie meal after paying for things like school fees mielie meal is zimbabwe s staple food and is made from maize or corn but some economists maintain that zimbabwe had to take bold steps to defend its sovereign currency even if conditions weren t perfect even if fundamentals were not yet right the use of multi currencies was not sustainable said gundani we are not producing optimally we are vulnerable on the import cover and our economy is in recession on a gdp level but we are coming from a background where the rtgs was already in circulation along with other currencies and was depreciating against the us dollar at an alarming rate and while confidence in the new currency may be in short supply gundani believes that if policymakers show discipline the zimdollar may yet have a shot last week the reserve bank of zimbabwe removed 1 2 billion zimbabwean dollars 1 463m from circulation to shore up the zimdollar and announced it would inject 400 million zimbabwean dollars 48 7m into the economy a day after the announcement and the mop up exercise the zimdollar recovered some 40 percent of its value against the us dollar on the black market i believe this is an opportunity to create that confidence by doing the right things and desisting from doing the things that killed the first zimbabwe dollar such as printing money to finance budget deficits said gundani it s a big gamble that we cannot afford to lose
richard mahomva post correspondent so far the implementation of the tsp has been aimed at recuperating an economy which had been dysfunctional for over three decades among its hallmark footprints to zimbabwe s economic turn around is the much anticipated re dollarisation herein defined as the introduction of the local zimbabwean currency as the legal tender for all transaction according to the ministry of finance this policy position is an exigent step which was needed in the addressing zimbabwe s economic inflation under the multi currency system he transitional stabilisation programme tsp has laid the foundation for fiscal consolidation at the same time generating sustainable budget methods therefore the merits of the country s de dollarisation process are briefly outlined from a broadly socio political perspective here de dollarisation refers to the elimination of the us dollar as a legal tender in zimbabwe zimbabwe adopted the multi currency regime in 2009 to curb the ruinous hyperinflation it has served its purpose and over stayed its welcome however in 2016 the government due to shortages of cash issued a surrogate currency the bond note which was trading along with the rtgs the multi currency basket composed of the united states dollar usd south african rand british pound botswana pula and a wide range of other foreign currencies but the usd was the widely spread currency in the market most goods and services prices were pegged at parallel market based rates this later invited the inter bank rating intervention by the reserve bank of zimbabwe what re dollarisation means the usd was taking about 90 of the transactional activity in the economy and the government has no control over this crisis consequently it was an imperative step for the government to employ a bold policy move to expedite the re introduction of the country s currency the fundamental merit of this position is that the country s sovereign dignity is restored as this is in synch with substantiating the transitional output of the second republic this is a mark of sacrificial rebirth of a people s dignity beyond political parameters but a loud acclamation to realigning the correct economic fundamentals of a nation which had been long aborted to sustain corruption and illicit financial flows it was only appropriate that the government had to take a responsible action to abate the monopoly of the economy by oligopolies as such progressive zimbabweans must support government s reintroduction of the zimbabwean currency and in all logic and the call for re dollarisation must be cast away from our development trajectory as this inclination only coincides with the retrogressive impulse to suffocate the country s economic growth capacity export growth potential has been suppressed by the dominance of the usd centred economy this propelled the backbone of an import based economy which offers an uncompetitive ground for local industry to flourish as a result the us de dollarisation is a critical step in clamping the influence of the parallel market in fracturing the potential growth of the local economy on several accounts the minister of finance prof mthuli ncube all the fundamentals to deal with the new currency are now in place the government has managed to record a surplus almost each month and has enough gold and other precious minerals to back the new currency this goes on to substantiate the success output of the transitional stabilisation programme tsp which among many other objectives was put into place to bring stability to the economy the long term impact of this policy s implementation will be noted through zimbabwe s economic actualisation of zimbabwe earmarked at reaching a middle income class status by 2030 as capsuled in vision 2030 which among a plethora of goals stresses the need for improved governance and the rule of law re orientation of the country towards democracy upholding freedoms of expression and association peace and national unity respect for human and property rights the abandonment of the multi currency system was inspired by the need to protect civil servants from local businesses that were now demanding forex for goods and services the civil service was now up in arms with government with valid points that they are paid in rtgs in an economy that had virtually dollarised the zimbabwe dollar zim will now be the sole legal tender for all local transactions the situation we were in were prices of commodities were packed against the black market rate of usd and prices of goods going up daily was not sustainable civil servants were no longer able to buy good in shops they could not pay for medicines and health care services when hospitals and clinics were demanding payments in usd the zim can help the general populace which was at the mercy of unscrupulous business entities the scrapping of the multi currency system on local transactions brings political and economic stability in the country the re dollarisation approach is inclusive because the multi currency system was now disenfranchising other citizens who were now unable to access goods and services priced in the usd this is a pro poor and peoples intervention that will go a long way in bettering the livelihoods of our people the re introduction of zim would help businesses to clear legacy debts on 1 1 basis as announced by the minister this is a very big plus to business businesses are going to wipe off debts if they have enough rtgs balances and businesspeople will start on a new slate this policy pronunciation serves both industry and the people the removal of multi currency system would be central to re industrialisation that was illusive under the usd the intervention has prevented economic implosion that was being driven by the loss of value of the local unit due to market manipulation by parallel market foreign currency dealers the increase of forex on interbank market and issue of lcs would be a soft landing measure for industry to avoid economic shock the removal of the multi currency system will further improve competitiveness and effort should be made to ensure importation of essential raw materials capital goods drugs medicines fuel and energy only companies that import raw materials should be given preference to get forex at the interbank market the promulgation of si 142 0f 2019 has also helped the banking sector the banks are now able to charge 50 interest on loans this means banks are going to redeem some value from loans because the rate of inflation meant that what was borrowed would be meaningless in terms of repayments this has brought normalcy in terms of lending the policy announcement stamp out borrowing for speculative purposes the coming of zim has served the country from recession that we were experiencing and without our own currency it was going to be very difficult to move out of it the country has to move on and embrace its own currency and have independence in monetary policy formulation with reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz playing the lender of last resort role in sync with the ongoing fiscal policy reforms the intervention gave rbz full control of monetary policy to defend the value of the currency the local market had continued to plummet due to black market activities resulting in most people

spread the love harare zimbabwe the move was bold and many did not see it coming in a bid to defend the new and fledgling zimbabwean dollar against black market speculation the country s finance minister on june 25 outlawed using united states dollars and other foreign currencies in local transactions when news of the policy broke harare based independent economist john robertson thought it was a bad practical joke i am not fully convinced it s genuine robertson told al jazeera this idea is so bad it s a cause for concern i fear it may be an attempt in government to cause someone embarrassment we hope it is revised zimbabwe s finance minister mthuli ncube had hinted on several occasions that a new zimbabwean dollar was in the works the country had already made a move toward it earlier this year when it introduced an interim currency the real time gross settlement rtgs dollar or zimdollar but a decade after devastating hyperinflation prompted the country to dollarise its economy by allowing the us greenback and other foreign currencies to be used as legal tender many zimbabweans are sceptical about the stability of the country s new currency and worried about what could happen if their livelihoods are tied to it not even six months old the fledgling zimdollar has suffered from speculative attacks that saw its value plummet by more than 150 percent before recovering for 67 year old david mkono the country s new currency has just added to his myriad problems mkono worked as a boilerman for zimbabwe s power utility company for 47 years paying into his pension in us dollars from 2009 until he retired last year at retirement i was going to get 223 per month i am not sure how much i am going to get now with the new changes mkono told al jazeera i really don t know how to value this because i don t know what 223 is now in rtgs some economists see zimbabwe s swift outlawing of the us dollar as justified given most countries that dollarise their economies fail to successfully reintroduce a new local currency it s a chance to disprove the notion that once an economy dollarises it can t have its currency ever many countries have failed kipson gundani a harare based economist and executive director of the ceo africa roundtable told al jazeera while dollarisation can help stabilise an economy in the throes of hyperinflation there are drawbacks local currencies are a powerful symbol of sovereignty and national identity countries that dollarise also lose the power to directly influence their own economy through monetary policy but zimbabwe s economy is not exactly fertile ground for a new currency to take root the country is likely in recession and the international monetary fund predicts the economy could contract 5 2 percent his year industry is operating at less than half of its installed capacity reliance on imports which become more expensive as the local currency weakens is stubbornly high mkono who has two children aged 12 and 8 says soaring inflation is already making it difficult for him to provide food for his family the prices have gone up rapidly in the shops he said when i get my monthly allowance we realise that we can t buy basic things like mielie meal after paying for things like school fees mielie meal is zimbabwe s staple food and is made from maize or corn but some economists maintain that zimbabwe had to take bold steps to defend its sovereign currency even if conditions weren t perfect even if fundamentals were not yet right the use of multi currencies was not sustainable said gundani we are not producing optimally we are vulnerable on the import cover and our economy is in recession on a gdp level but we are coming from a background where the rtgs was already in circulation along with other currencies and was depreciating against the us dollar at an alarming rate and while confidence in the new currency may be in short supply gundani believes that if policymakers show discipline the zimdollar may yet have a shot last week the reserve bank of zimbabwe removed 1 2 billion zimbabwean dollars 1 463m from circulation to shore up the zimdollar and announced it would inject 400 million zimbabwean dollars 48 7m into the economy a day after the announcement and the mop up exercise the zimdollar recovered some 40 percent of its value against the us dollar on the black market i believe this is an opportunity to create that confidence by doing the right things and desisting from doing the things that killed the first zimbabwe dollar such as printing money to finance budget deficits said gundani it s a big gamble that we cannot afford to lose source al jazeera share this share twitter facebook email linkedin reddit pinterest whatsapp like this like loading

how big will the punch bowl be this time around financial markets are convinced the fed is set to commence on an easing cycle this summer but if we see fed fund futures price in only two rate cuts this year us stocks will struggle to make fresh highs and the highly anticipated dollar reversal may not come to fruition friday s blockbuster us non farm payroll report tentatively derailed stock and equity bullish plans the needle was moved from a slight lean towards 3 rate cuts to two cuts the dollar s broad gains accompanied a surge with us treasury yields and a pullback in stocks the focus will now shift to incremental updates on the trade front and a plethora of fed speak and the minutes to last month s decision us inflation data will be released but other indications do not point for a significant surprise rise the release of china s trade figures will show how resilient their economy was during the tensest moments in the trade war with the pboc waiting to stimulate their economy we could see dismal data support earlier action regarding trade we will need to see meaningful updates or scheduled trips to dc or beijing to support optimism that both sides are closing the gap a wrath of fed speak will see investors search for clues if the fed waiver on its signal for a july rate cut powell testifies on semiannual monetary policy report trade war impact on chinese trade and inflation data german industrial production could fuel contraction bets euro stimulus bets from the ecb may grow if we continue to see a trend of softer than expected data out of germany the brewing trade war between the us and europe will likely to continue to weigh on car manufacturers with germany bearing the brunt of the troubles industrial production on a monthly basis is expected to rebound but following a very disappointing factory orders reading we should not be surprised if the german data comes in softer if we see lagarde become the ecb chief we could see fiscal stimulus expectations rise which should be very positive for both growth and the euro draghi s ecb has stated they are in no rush to deliver a rate cut this month but if the data continues to show significant slowdowns a 20 basis point cut could happen this month cad the bank of canada boc is widely expected to keep rates steady with only one economist calling for a 25 basis point cut monetary policy is expected to remain on hold for the rest of the year as the recent data has been surprisingly better than expected not counting friday s cool labor market number employment has been on a tear with the first half

area oil got a boost on an improving outlook for demand on a surprising robust us nonfarm payroll report fresh stimulus bets are still strong for the fed to deliver a rate cut at the end of july and for the other big three banks the pboc ecb and boj to remain active in delivering additional stimulus if we do see us and china come through with scheduling face to face talks we could see markets again to price in further optimism we could see a deal done this year global demand would get a reprieve if china and us could finalize a trade deal geopolitical risks are also keeping a bid in place for oil as iran continues to increase their nuclear activities up until now most of europe has been trying to negotiate with tehran but if iran continues to with their nuclear agenda we could see deeper international sanctions that could completely cripple iran s economy gold gold lost some of its mojo after a robust nonfarm payroll report eased up dovish bets on the fed the overall outlook for bullion is still looking bright as gold etf inflows appears insuppressible robust demand for the yellow metal will continue to be supported on the backdrop of expectations of fresh stimulus to be

economic releases will be somewhat sparser in the coming week but there will be several key data to keep an eye on as well as central bank activity that could shape expectations of future monetary policy the bank of canada meets for its latest policy decision and will probably resist making a dovish tilt while the minutes of the federal reserve s and the european central bank s last policy meetings will be watched for clues on their upcoming decisions later this month chinese exports probably fell back in june as us and chinese officials make preparations to restart trade talks trade numbers out of china on friday will come under the spotlight amid signs the world s second largest economy may require further stimulus to stave off a deep slowdown chinese exports unexpectedly rose by 1 1 year on year in may though this was mostly due to the frontloading of shipments from the latest round of tariffs imposed by the united states they are forecast to have declined by 2 y y in june a bigger drop would accentuate worries about the economy and add to calls for more policy easing another indication of the strength of the chinese economy will come from june producer prices due on wednesday the producer price index is forecast to fall to just 0 2 y y suggesting weak demand for factory goods and raw materials the consumer price index will also be released on wednesday a disappointing set of figures could pressure the yuan a little but not so much the australian dollar often seen as a better liquid proxy for the yuan as china is the main destination for australian exports the aussie has been benefiting from higher iron ore prices and narrowing negative spreads between australian and us yields so is likely to hold firm unless china s trade stats cause a major deterioration in risk sentiment machinery orders coming up in japan machinery orders will be the main release in japan which will kick off the week on monday despite the ongoing trade uncertainty and weakening overseas demand japanese machinery orders were up for the third straight month in april industrial production has also steadied after plunging in january the final reading for industrial output in may is out on friday and before that corporate goods prices will be viewed on wednesday the not so gloomy economic picture in japan probably explains why the bank of japan is not in any hurry yet to join its counterparts in signalling looser policy one area of concern though for the boj is the deterioration in earnings which have been falling throughout 2019 the may figure is out on tuesday and another annual drop would not bode well for consumer demand hence growth but until the boj sends out explicit signals of policy easing the yen will likely continue to appreciate against its peers as most other central banks move towards or have moved in cutting rates will ecb minutes pave way for rate cut apart from industrial output numbers the european calendar will be relatively light next week putting the focus on the ecb s june meeting minutes at the start of the week the market s attention will fall on the german economy as industrial output and trade data will be released on monday the eurozone wide industrial production figures will follow on friday the bloc s manufacturing sector particularly germany s continues to struggle as trade tensions weigh on business investment and disrupt global supply chains and with the trump administration seeking to expand the trade fight to more countries including the european union instead of looking to end it the eurozone s outlook has grown dimmer this has forced the ecb to rethink its policy normalization plans as inflation has also moderated at the june meeting the ecb refrained from adopting a clear loosening bias even though president draghi did say some members raised the possibility of a rate cut the account of that meeting to be published on thursday should provide some insight into those discussions although there have been several signals since the june meeting including from draghi himself that additional stimulus may be on the cards a dovish account could still pressure the euro which this week slipped back below 1 13 on declining eurozone bond yields uk may data could point to q2 contraction the uk s growth outlook is not looking any better either lately and the economy probably underperformed its european partners in the second quarter as the brexit extension has only prolonged the period of uncertainty for british businesses uk gdp shrank by 0 4 month on month in april and data due on wednesday is forecast to show gdp recovering by 0 3 in may both industrial and manufacturing output also slumped in april as firms sought to run down the large stockpiles they built in the prior month in may they re expected to have rebounded by 1 5 and 2 5 m m respectively if the numbers indicate the uk economy likely contracted in the second quarter this would further hinder the bank of england s intension to raise interest rates in the next 12 months even if there is a smooth brexit markets already think the next move will be down having priced in a more than 50 probability of a cut by december sterling could struggle to hold above key support at the 1 25 level if next week s releases further raise the odds of a boe rate cut by year end fomc minutes and june cpi to be us highlights as investors digest the mixed data on the us economy from the past week attention will move onto the latest consumer and producer prices as well as the minutes of the fed s june policy meeting the 12 month cpi rate out on thursday is expected to have dropped by 0 1 percentage points to 1 7 in june producer prices for the same month will follow on friday while the cpi numbers are not anticipated to be of much significance to investors pricing of a rate reduction by the fed at the end of this month weaker than expected figures would only reinforce the view that the us central bank will ease policy and this would keep the us dollar on the backfoot more important for the dollar though will be wednesday s fomc minutes of the june meeting the june dot plot chart saw a major shift in fomc members forecasts of the rate path but the median projection was for rates to stay on hold for the rest of 2019 the minutes could reveal how close 9 of the 17 fomc members who didn t predict a rate cut were to changing their inclination bank of canada to stand pat things have perked up lately for the canadian economy as inflation has overshot expectations and gdp growth has accelerated higher oil prices have also improved canada s growth prospects as well as the canadian dollar s normally the bank of canada would not have hesitated to hike rates under such conditions however with the global economy slowing down and other central banks switching to a dovish stance the boc will probably decide to hold monetary policy steady for the time being the bank is widely anticipated to keep rates at 1 75 at it s meeting on wednesday and futures markets see only about a 20 probability of lower rates by december with the bank s announcement statement not expected to give much away investors will be looking at stephen poloz s press conference and the quarterly monetary policy report for more clues on what direction the boc will take in the coming months in the meantime the greenback s declining yield advantage has driven the loonie to eight month highs as interest rates in the us could soon fall below those in canada

bill watch 33 2019 source monetary policy and the rule of law the zimbabwean since si 142 was published government officials have made it clear that they believe it is now a criminal offence for storekeepers to price their goods in us dollars or any other foreign currency and for anyone to use foreign currency rather than zimbabwe dollars in any transaction carried out in this country thus the governor of the reserve bank is reported to have told a parliamentary committee there are many tools of enforcing statutory instrument 142 of 2019 including the bank use promotion and suppression of money laundering act chapter 24 24 which was approved by the parliament of zimbabwe the financial intelligence unit within the central bank and members of the police force who are already seized with the matter to ensure that at least there is compliance and indeed enforceability of this matter enforcement is very possible and they have already started doing so to ensure that all local payments are made in the zimbabwe dollar and that payments offshore are done in us dollars and the national police spokesman is reported as saying the zrp zimbabwe republic police warns all those who are charging commodities in united states dollars that they risk being arrested as the law will be applied without fear or favour members of the public should report such people to any nearest police station is the use of foreign currency criminal it needs to be asserted strongly that contrary to what the governor of the reserve bank said it is no t a criminal offence to use foreign currency in transactions within zimbabwe or to price goods in a foreign currency there are several reasons for this assertion si 142 may be invalid at least two cases have been filed in the high court challenging si 142 of 2019 on the ground that it is ultra vires the reserve bank of zimbabwe act under which it was purportedly made there is substance in these challenges the multi currency system was introduced in 2009 by the finance no 2 act 2009 but it was done in rather an odd way section 17 of the act first amended the reserve bank of zimbabwe act so as to insert a new section 44a which gave the minister of finance power to make regulations prescribing that tenders of payment in specified foreign currencies would be legal tender in zimbabwe however section 17 of the finance act then confused matters by adding a further provision stating that british pounds us dollars south african rand and botswana pula shall be deemed to be legal tender as if the new section 44a were already in force and the minister had made regulations under it as a result the multi currency system was not introduced by regulations made under section 44a of the reserve bank of zimbabwe act it was introduced by the finance no 2 act itself which deemed the minister to have made the appropriate regulations under our law ministers cannot make regulations amending or repealing acts of parliament and it is arguable by enacting si 142 the minister has repealed the finance act s declaration of foreign currencies as legal tender which he cannot do si 142 does not ban the use of foreign currency even if it is valid si 142 does not expressly state that foreign currencies cannot be used in transactions or to price goods instead it provides that the zimbabwe dollar is the sole legal tender in zimbabwe for all transactions as we said in our bill watch 32 of 24th june 2019 legal tender means a currency which if offered in payment of a debt discharges the debt unless the creditor and the debtor have specifically agreed otherwise so if a debtor owes a creditor 20 say the debtor can normally repay the debt by offering 20 in rtgs dollars because they are legal tender if however the parties have agreed that the debt should be repaid in us dollars then the debtor must repay it in those dollars does not specifically forbid contracts that require payments to be made or calculated in a foreign currency so if shopkeepers mark their prices in us dollars for example or insist on payment in that currency there is nothing to stop them doing so si 142 does not create any criminal offences there is no provision in si 142 of 2019 stating that the use of a foreign currency rather than zimbabwe dollars is a criminal offence there could not be any such provision because sections 44a and 64 of the reserve bank of zimbabwe under which the si was made do not allow the minister to create criminal offences or to put it more precisely the sections do not provide expressly for criminal offences and in the absence of such a provision the minister cannot create them no other law makes it an offence to use foreign currency if si 142 of 2019 does not criminalise the use of foreign currency is there any other law that does no there isn t the reserve bank governor mentioned the bank use promotion and suppression of money laundering act but that act does not deal with foreign currency it prohibits traders and other business people from hoarding or trading in cash and provides for the confiscation of cash illegally held cash however is defined in the act as meaning bank notes and coins of any currency that is designated as legal tender in zimbabwe if zimbabwe dollars are as the government claims the sole legal tender in this country then bond notes and coins are the only cash to which the bank use promotion act can apply the rule of law the statements made by the governor of the reserve bank and the police are therefore wrong but they are not just wrong they are dangerously wrong because they may lead to serious violations of the rule of law the rule of law is an elastic concept but fundamentally it means that people s rights and obligations must be determined by laws rather than by individuals or groups of individuals exercising an arbitrary discretion from this fundamental concept several principles are derived among them the following no one is above the law state officials and even the state itself are subject to the law and must act in accordance with the law laws must be certain i e clear and definite people must be able to establish relatively easily the content of a law and the extent of their rights and duties under it crimes must be clearly defined and reasonably limited in scope people must know what they can and cannot do the statements made by the governor of the reserve bank and the police violate these principles because they misstate the effect of the law leading the public to believe that storekeepers and others are committing crimes when they are not they encourage the police to arrest people for conduct which is in fact lawful any such arrests will be illegal and may leave the police officers concerned liable to pay heavy damages what should be done if the minister of finance and the governor of the reserve bank want to outlaw the use of foreign currency as a medium of exchange in zimbabwe then they must do it properly that is to say they must work out precisely and in detail what they want to achieve with the aid of their legal advisers they must establish what the existing law says on the subject this is not as easy as it sounds because our statute books are littered with old rules and regulations which are still legally in force even though they may have outlived their purpose they must then work out which laws need to be enacted repealed or amended in order to achieve the new policy goals next they must get laws drafted so as to give effect to their new policies while observing the precepts of the rule of law mentioned above and finally the minister must approach parliament to enact the new laws why parliament because when laws pass through parliament they are subjected to scrutiny and debate stakeholders such as businesses and members of the public are given an opportunity to express their views when laws are referred to the appropriate parliamentary committees and there is the further point that the constitution makes parliament not the executive responsible for enacting laws separation of powers is one of the main principles derived from the rule of law veritas makes every effort to ensure reliable information but cannot take legal responsibility for information supplied

decade low and wages rise to their highest level in over a year statistics canada says the unemployment rate edged up to 5 5 per cent compared to 5 4 per cent in may which was its lowest mark since the government started collecting comparable data in 1976 economists on average had expected an addition of 10 000 jobs in june and the unemployment rate to rise to 5 5 per cent according to thomson reuters eikon even with the small decline the numbers show the economy added 248 000 new positions almost all of which were full time over the first half of 2019 to give canada its strongest six month stretch of job growth to start a year since 2002 year over year average hourly wage growth for all employees was 3 8 per cent in june giving the indicator its strongest month since may 2018 and second best reading in a decade u s job growth rebounded strongly in june but moderate wage gains and mounting evidence that the economy was slowing sharply could still encourage the federal reserve to cut interest rates this month the u s labor department s closely watched employment report suggested may s sharp slowdown in hiring was probably a fluke lack of concrete progress in resolving an acrimonious trade war between the united states and china however means the bar could be very high for the federal reserve not to lower borrowing costs at its july 30 31 policy meeting nonfarm

jobless rate has been because of people leaving the labour market a broader measure of unemployment which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time

menafn caribbean news now washington usa on june 12 2019 the executive board of the international monetary fund imf concluded the article iv consultation with grenada the grenadian economy continues to grow robustly gdp expanded by 4¼ percent in 2018 driven by strong activity in construction and tourism unemployment has been falling but it remains high at 21 7 percent as of mid 2018 inflation has remained low and bank credit growth is positive the external current account deficit is estimated to have narrowed in 2018 due to strong tourism receipts but it remains elevated at around 11 percent of gdp robust fdi flows including from the citizenship by investment cbi program are financing the external deficit while supporting economic growth adherence to the fiscal responsibility law frl has enabled further debt reduction the fiscal surplus increased further in 2018 reflecting a combination of strong revenues and the frl mandated expenditure restraint low execution of grant financing and institutional bottlenecks in project execution combined to keep capital outlays subdued at 2¾ percent of gdp central government debt fell from 70 to 63½ percent of gdp in 2018 but arrears to algeria libya and trinidad and tobago remain to be regularized growth is set to remain above potential in 2019 but is projected to ease somewhat over the medium term consistent with a waning of fdi driven construction the fiscal position is projected to loosen over the medium term in line with the frl s provisions that take effect after public debt falls below 55 percent of gdp and should provide some support to the economy external risks are mainly on the downside and are centered on prospects for u s growth and global financial conditions domestic risks are two way and partly hinge on the

resilience gaps they highlighted the need to enhance the business climate and competitiveness including through improvements in labor market institutions they noted that education and training

mining industry standing what is the nature and importance of the mining industry in your country angola is one of the richest countries in the world in natural resources with significant reserves of diamonds iron ore phosphates copper gold and manganese among other valuable natural resources however its true mineral potential is yet to be unlocked despite the significant exploration and mining projects already implemented in particular within the diamond subsector once a major iron ore gold and copper producer angola s mineral development was greatly impaired after independence in 1975 except diamond mining by almost 30 years of civil war which ended in 2002 angola has since resumed mineral mining as a result of the national geology plan planageo and the 2013 17 national development plan launched by the angolan government one may now observe the effective boost and diversification of the national mining industry that now covers a broader variety of mineral projects despite all efforts at diversification angola s second largest export continues to be gems and precious metals particularly diamonds this strategic focus on the mining sector is well reflected in the 2018 22 national development plan approved by the government in april 2018 which projects a substantial increase in diamond production from 9 million carats in 2017 to 13 8 million carats in 2022 mostly driven by the recent commencement of several mining operations the 2018 22 national development plan also foresees a boost in the production of other minerals such as gold construction mineral resources and ornamental stones this focus appears to be the way forward and the mining sector s role in the future of the country is expected to increase in the short term target minerals what are the target minerals a very significant portion of angola s rich and varied natural resources remains unexplored in recent years target minerals continue to be diamonds gold iron ore manganese and copper however recently investment has diversified into industrial and construction mineral resources eg marble granite and quartz regions which regions are most active the most active and promising regions for mining potential are lunda north lunda south uíge huíla cuanza north and malange with new investment in industrial and construction minerals resources exploitation new regions are taking the lead such as bengo and namibe legal and regulatory structure basis of legal system is the legal system civil or common law based angola s legal system is civil law based regulation how is the mining industry regulated the mining industry is regulated at state level by the angolan constitution law no 31 11 of 23 september 2011 mining code and some additional statutory and regulatory acts the angolan mineral regime may be described as a contractual system laws and regulations take second place to contracts in the definition of the material terms and conditions which are often found in the relevant mineral investment contracts granting the mineral rights along with the detailed operational and economic terms and conditions for the exercise of the mineral rights what are the principal laws that regulate the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws were there any major amendments in the past year the mining code is the cornerstone of the angolan mineral regime and governs the exploration and mining of all minerals this law regulates exploration evaluation reconnaissance mining and marketing of mineral resources in general besides the mining code the following are also relevant for the mining sector presidential decree 85 19 of 21 march 2019 which approves the regulations for semi industrial mining of diamonds presidential decree 35 19 of 31 january 2019 which approves the technical regulations for marketing of rough diamonds presidential decree 175 18 of 27 july 2018 which approves the new rough diamonds marketing policy law no 10 2018 of 26 june 2018 which approves the private investment law pil presidential decree 250 18 of 30 october 2018 which approves the regulations for the pil executive decree 346 17 of 14 july 2017 which sets forth the criteria for delimitation of concession areas for exploitation of construction materials joint executive decree 316 17 of 27 june 2017 which approves the list of equipment for use in exploration and mining activities exempted from customs duties and fees presidential decree 231 16 of 8 december 2016 which classifies rare metals and rare earth elements as strategic minerals presidential decree 158 16 of 10 august 2016 which sets forth administrative offences and relevant penalties order 255 14 of 28 january 2014 of the ministry of geology and mines on monitoring of posting of bonds and payments of surface fee and royalties under the mining code and order 2 03 of 28 february 2003 of the central bank of angola which establishes the foreign exchange regime applicable to holders of mineral rights the ministry of mineral resources and petroleum mmrp the ministry of finance and the angolan central bank bna are the main regulatory entities the national concessionaire for diamonds rare metals and rare earth elements endiama ep and the national concessionaire for noble materials ferrous and non ferrous metals ferrangol ep are vested with certain regulatory and supervisory powers in respect of the minerals falling within their authority as concessionaires also noteworthy is empresa nacional de comercialização de diamantes de angola ep sodiam recently converted from a joint stock company into a state owned company which acts as the single channel for marketing of all diamond productions extracted from angola the market regulation agency for gold the state entity with the purpose of organising regulating and supervising the gold market set up by presidential decree 2 14 of 2 january 2014 was recently extinguished by means of presidential decree 291 18 of 3 december 2018 with all power and authority now vested in the mmrp this amendment falls within the reform of angola s mining sector that the government has undertaken which comprises among other the establishement of the national agency of mineral resources a new body of the mmrp presumably to take up certain roles of the national concessionaires for the mining industry the former market regulation agency for gold endiama ep and ferrangol ep the national agency of mineral resources is yet to be incorporated classification system what classification system does the mining industry use for reporting mineral resources and mineral reserves the mining code refers to secondary legislation for the classification of reserves although that legislation has yet to be enacted in its absence mineral resources and mineral reserves should be classified in accordance with internationally accepted methods and systems to be approved by the mmrp mining rights and title state control over mining rights to what extent does the state control mining rights in your jurisdiction can those rights be granted to private parties and to what extent will they have title to minerals in the ground are there large areas where the mining rights are held privately or which belong to the owner of the surface rights is there a separate legal regime or process for third parties to obtain mining rights in those areas the state is the owner of all mineral resources according to the angolan constitution and the mining code and the state sets forth the terms and conditions for their concession exploration and mining which gives it effective control over the grant of mining rights under the mining code state owned mixed ownership or private companies may be granted and enforce mineral rights for exploration and mining in contrast to the former mining law the state is entitled to participate in mineral production in consideration for the grant of mineral rights for mining and marketing through a state owned company with at least a 10 per cent shareholding in the company to be set up for the mining stage or a participation or both in kind minerals produced in a proportion to be defined the proportion increases directly with the increase in the internal rate of return of the project endiama ep is the national concessionaire for diamonds rare metals and rare earth elements and ferrangol ep is the national concessionaire for noble materials ferrous and non ferrous metals both concessionaires may establish unincorporated or incorporated joint ventures with other angolan or foreign partners for the performance of their operations publicly available information and data what information and data are publicly available to private parties that wish to engage in exploration and other mining activities is there an agency which collects mineral assessment reports from private parties must private parties file mineral assessment reports does the agency or the government conduct geoscience surveys which become part of the database is the database available online concession decrees granting mineral rights are published in the angolan official gazette and there is also a public registry for mining companies the executive branch produces and compiles all data on mineral resources and mineral reserves but may authorise other public or private entities to perform those activities in duly justified cases private entities wishing to invest in the mining sector may consult available mining data at the mmrp however no official databases are available online holders of exploration licences must submit periodic reports containing all data and information acquired during the programme on production and marketing of mineral substances and mineral activities carried out in order for the mmrp to be able to monitor and inspect mineral activities holders must also submit an updated work programme and a forecast of the minimum expenditures to be made in the following year given the statutory requirement of a public tender to grant mineral rights over strategic minerals ie diamonds gold radioactive minerals rare metals and rare earth elements or in areas of high geological potential mmrp is required to publish a list of the areas up for award and the relevant terms of reference in the angolan official gazette or in a widely read newspaper at least once a year and within question 1 acquisition of rights by private parties what mining rights may private parties acquire how are these acquired what obligations does the rights holder have if exploration or reconnaissance licences are granted does such tenure give the holder an automatic or preferential right to acquire a mining licence what are the requirements to convert to a mining licence the mining code adopts a single contract model for the entire mineral process the former legal framework foresaw two separate contracts for mineral projects one for exploration evaluation and reconnaissance and another for mining and marketing the mining code divides mineral activities into three stages reconnaissance and exploration appraisal and mining explicitly stating that the rules rights and obligations for the three stages will be set forth in the relevant mineral investment contract under the former legal regime in addition to spontaneous applications the state could organise public tenders or issue invitations to tender for the award of exploration licences for one or more previously designated areas conversely the mining code clearly prefers public tenders which can be either optional or compulsory depending on the geological potential of the relevant area or the strategic classification of the mineral in question minerals are classified as strategic if warranted by their economic importance use for strategic purposes or specific technical mining aspects the mineral s rarity relevant impact on economic growth high demand on the international market significant job creation importance for state of the art technology positive influence on the balance of payments or importance to the military industry are deemed as fundamental factors to be weighted by the executive branch when classifying a mineral as strategic diamonds gold and radioactive minerals are expressly defined as strategic minerals in the mining code and rare metals and rare earth elements were also recently defined as strategic minerals in presidential decree 231 16 of 8 december 2016 if no public tender is required mineral reconnaissance exploration evaluation appraisal and mining rights will be granted on a first come first served basis the applicant is merely required to demonstrate that it possesses the technical and financial capacities required to carry out the mineral activities for which it has applied the following titles are issued for mineral rights exploration title for the reconnaissance exploration evaluation and appraisal of mineral resources mining title for the mining of mineral resources mineral permit for the exploration or mining of mineral resources used in civil construction and mineral ticket for artisanal mining among several other obligations holders of mineral rights must ensure the hiring of angolan technicians and workers and provide training and technical and vocational instruction to the employees apply the methods most suited to obtain maximum yield consistent with market economic conditions environmental protection and sound exploitation of the mineral resources without carrying out rapacious mining relinquish the initial area covered by the mineral rights for exploration step wise ensure and enforce compliance with the rules on health and safety at work and the requirements of the environmental impact assessment study report on the impact of the mineral activities on land occupancy and environmental characteristics and repair the damage caused to third parties by the performance of geological and mineral activities under the single contract model all mineral rights from exploration to marketing including evaluation reconnaissance and mining are formally granted from the outset pursuant to the mineral investment contract however the holder of the relevant mineral rights is required to obtain an exploration title issued at the same time with as the approval and gazetting of the mineral investment contract and a mining title as a condition for the exercise of the rights granted to it the transition of a given mineral project from the exploration stage to the mining stage is subject to the preparation and approval of a technical economic and financial viability study the mining title is then issued after the study is approved which must include an environmental impact study and the holder of the relevant rights can exercise its mining and marketing rights from then on renewal and transfer of mineral licences what is the regime for the renewal and transfer of mineral licences exploration evaluation and reconnaissance rights may be granted for an initial period of up to five years and extended by successive one year periods up to a maximum seven years if the seven year period proves insufficient to prepare or complete the feasibility study the holder of the mineral rights may apply for and be granted an exceptional one year extension mining rights are granted for a period of up to 35 years which includes the exploration and appraisal stage extendable by one or more 10 year periods holders applying for extension must justify their application by submitting the relevant technical operational and other grounds extensions are only granted if the applicant is not in breach of its legal and contractual obligations mineral rights may be transferred upon specific authorisation from the mmrp or the head of the executive as applicable which is only granted to prospective assignees that meet the same technical and financial requirements as the original rights holders although mining laws do not specifically address the issue changes of control of the holders of mineral rights or their parent companies are typically notified to the mmrp no consent or authorisation is legally required per se but it is an expression of courtesy that will help maintain a sound institutional relationship with the relevant authorities and avoid charges that the change of control at stake was actually a way of circumventing the authorisation required for the transfer of the relevant mineral rights duration of mining rights what is the typical duration of mining rights see question 11 for the duration and extension of mineral rights concession contracts may be terminated early and concession titles withdrawn in some of the following instances termination or withdrawal is triggered under specific contractual clauses the project becomes technically or economically unviable breach of legal obligations contractual obligations or obligations arising from the concession title abandonment suspension or reduction of the mineral operations except as provided for in the mining code the title or the contracts suspension of mineral operations owing to force majeure events as defined in the contract or concession title the concession holder is convicted of a crime of aggravated contempt because it failed to perform acts provided for in the mining code or ordered by the relevant authority reconnaissance exploration evaluation and appraisal or mining of mineral resources not included in the contract or concession title and performance of the contractual obligations is impossible acquisition by domestic parties versus acquisition by foreign parties is there any distinction in law or practice between the mining rights that may be acquired by domestic parties and those that may be acquired by foreign parties angolan law does not require the participation of local partners in mineral concessions therefore both foreign and local mining companies owned by angolan nationals may be awarded concessions and engage in the exploration and mining of minerals the national concessionaires endiama ep and ferrangol ep may partner with local or foreign entities in connection with mineral projects as members of unincorporated joint ventures set up for the exploration stage and as shareholders of the companies incorporated for the mining stage the award of mineral mining and marketing rights entitles the state to participate in mining concessions other than that there are no industry specific rules or restrictions on corporate structures nor are there mandatory participations or ownership interests reserved for national associates however preference is to be given to national partners or companies when setting up a business partnership semi industrial and artisanal mining of diamonds and construction minerals are the exception to the rule only angolan citizens are allowed to carry out diamond artisanal mining operations and only angolan citizens or legal persons whose share capital is majority held two thirds by angolan citizens may be awarded mineral rights for semi industrial mining of diamonds exploration and mining of construction minerals and mining rights of mineral rich waters protection of mining rights how are mining rights protected are foreign arbitration awards in respect of domestic mining disputes freely enforceable in your jurisdiction investors are afforded broad legal guarantees the unrestricted right to mine the mineral resources discovered during exploration except as expressly provided for in the mining code or ancillary legislation the right to freely dispose of and market the mining products the right to recover investment expenses incurred during the reconnaissance exploration evaluation and appraisal stage from the mining proceeds and the right to be compensated for any losses resulting from actions limiting the exercise of mineral rights under the law or the mineral investment contract the pil reinforces these guarantees by offering additional protection to foreign investment namely in matters of expropriation in contrast to the former legal framework which foresaw arbitration in angola as the proper mechanism to resolve any disputes that could not be resolved amicably between the parties the mining code is silent on the proper venue to resolve disputes leaving it up to the dispute resolution clauses of mineral investment contracts contracting parties tend to include arbitration clauses in their agreements however disputes arising from termination of the concession contract or withdrawal of the concession title must be resolved by national courts and disputes on the significance or insignificance of minerals extracted during the reconnaissance exploration evaluation and appraisal stage for purpose of assessment of the relevant tax should be settled by the minister responsible for the mining sector angola is a signatory of the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards 1958 and so international arbitral awards are recognised and enforceable in angola provided they are handed down in another contracting state the convention entered into force in angola on 4 june 2017 the angolan constitution states that courts are independent and cannot accept any form of interference from any other public body their decisions are final subject only to appeal and prevail over other entities decisions surface rights what types of surface rights may mining rights holders request and acquire how are these rights acquired can surface rights holders oppose these requests holders of exploration licences or mining titles do not acquire surface rights in relation to the concession areas if the land belongs to private persons or is in the private domain of the state or of public law corporate bodies holders of mineral rights will need the consent of the relevant owners or occupants to use or exploit the land on the terms that may be agreed between the parties this consent is also required for any geological mineral investigation works involving use of the land consent is presumed given in case of deposit of the annual rent and the provisional bond set forth in the mining code if the concessionaire fails to reach an agreement with the owners or occupants of the land within the boundaries of any demarcated area during the mining phase it is barred from starting any operations until it either purchases the land or the state expropriates the land for reasons of public interest pursuant to the law conversely private owners of a surface right over a certain area are not entitled to carry out exploration or mining activities without first securing the relevant exploration licence or mining title participation of government and state agencies does the government or do state agencies have the right to participate in mining projects is there a local listing requirement for the project company as mentioned in questions 8 and 13 the state is entitled to participate in the mineral production either through a minimum 10 per cent shareholding in the company holding the mining rights a production sharing mechanism or a combination of the latter endiama ep is involved in projects in connection with diamonds rare metals rare earth elements and ferrangol ep is involved in projects in connection with noble materials ferrous and non ferrous metals as members of the relevant unincorporated joint ventures or as shareholders of the companies holding the relevant mineral rights the project company is required to establish a legal presence in the country eg a subsidiary organised and run under angolan law or a local branch of a foreign company just as any other company wishing to engage in activities that require a physical presence in angola the set up of foreign special purpose vehicles or registration of any special purpose vehicle branches in angola although not legally prohibited per se is a practical impossibility in light of state participation requirement government expropriation of licences are there provisions in law dealing with government expropriation of licences what are the compensation provisions the mining code lists mineral investment contracts termination events and the grounds for withdrawing concession titles and also foresees the possibility of redeeming the concession area for reasons of public utility in the event of discovery of strategic mineral resources or minerals subject to a special framework whose mining is in the higher interest of the national economy subject to a fair compensation to the holder of the relevant mineral rights the compensation will be calculated on the basis of the amount of the investment made in the exploration evaluation reconnaissance and appraisal stage the unrecovered amount of the investment made in the exploration evaluation reconnaissance and appraisal stage in case the project has already moved on to the mining stage and the value of the assets redeemed including real estate property acquired for the exercise of the mineral rights the average estimated profit for the next 10 years of mining and the outstanding debts protected areas are any areas designated as protected areas within your jurisdiction and which are off limits or specially regulated under the mining code mineral rights may be awarded for areas in the territorial or maritime domain under the jurisdiction of the republic of angola that have not been granted for the carrying out of other activities or that are not allocated to the same the executive branch may also declare portions of the national territory with considerable mineral potential as mineral reserve areas which will then be restricted in terms of movement of people and goods to date no areas of angolan territory have been declared as mineral reserve areas duties royalties and taxes duties royalties and taxes payable by private parties what duties royalties and taxes are payable by private parties carrying on mining activities are these revenue based or profit based industrial tax income tax on mineral activities the tax rate currently in force is of 25 per cent for purposes of determining the taxable income costs of exploration evaluation and reconnaissance contributions to the mining development fund among others are considered as tax deductions additional to those provided for in the general tax law royalty tax on the value of mineral resources the tax rates currently in force are as follows strategic minerals including industrial diamonds and precious metals and stones 5 per cent semi precious stones 4 per cent metallic minerals semi industrial and artisanal diamonds 3 per cent and construction materials of mining origin and other minerals 2 per cent surface fee fee levied on the concession area awarded payable during the exploration phase the surface fee value varies according to the size of the concession area the type of mineral explored and the exploration year in question and can range from us 2 to us 40 per km2 these amounts are doubled in the event of extension of the exploration period contributions to the mining development fund and environmental fund the mining code imposes holders of mineral rights the duty to make annual contributions to the mining development fund and to the environmental fund contributions raging from roughly us 1 250 and us 3 000 tax advantages and incentives what tax advantages and incentives are available to private parties carrying on mining activities investments in the mining sector are covered by the mining code and on a subsidiary basis the pil tax advantages and incentives are negotiated and set out in the relevant mineral investment contract holders of mineral rights subject to industrial tax may obtain tax incentives by way of deductible costs tax incentives must be applied for with the minister of finance and are subject to an mmrp opinion the application for tax exemptions is discussed and negotiated during the contractual stage of the investment procedure and is attached to the contract after approval by the negotiations committee and issue of a favourable opinion by the mmrp the negotiations committee is comprised of representatives of the mmrp the national concessionaire if applicable the ministry of finance in the event fiscal and customs benefits and exemptions are to be negotiated and a regulatory authority should it be created incentives may be granted for the following acts with relevance to the angolan economy acquisition of supplemental goods and services on the local market carrying out mineral activities in remote areas a contribution to the training and development of local human resources carrying out of research and development activities in cooperation with angolan academic and scientific institutions local processing and dressing of minerals and a significant contribution to increase exports holders of mineral rights may also apply for and be granted investment premiums uplift grace periods for the payment of income tax whenever they are covered by any of the above mentioned situations and any other type of tax incentive provided for by law the executive branch may also authorise tax and customs exemptions to angolan companies exclusively engaged in the processing dressing and cutting of minerals extracted in the country tax stablisation does any legislation provide for tax stabilisation or are there tax stabilisation agreements in force there is no specific legislation on this matter in angola nor are there any tax stabilisation agreements in place in turn most if not all mineral investment contracts contain specific provisions on stability and supervening circumstances which may to a certain extent protect the investors rights and interests in this regard carried interest is the government entitled to a carried interest or a free carried interest in mining projects financial commitments on the part of the state are not to be expected even in the absence of any specific provision on the matter as state participation in the mining and marketing projects as opposed to exploration projects is a legal requirement notably by means of a shareholding interest in the relevant mining companies transfer taxes and capital gains are there any transfer taxes or capital gains imposed regarding the transfer of licences no gains resulting from the transfer of mineral rights will be taken into consideration when assessing the transferor s liability in terms of industrial tax corporate income tax however a 2 per cent conveyance tax may apply in certain cases distinction between domestic parties and foreign parties is there any distinction between the duties royalties and taxes payable by domestic parties and those payable by foreign parties there is no distinction between duties royalties and taxes payable by domestic parties and foreign parties business structures principal business structures what are the principal business structures used by private parties carrying on mining activities mineral activities are primarily carried out through locally incorporated companies and branches of foreign corporations mining concessions under which the mining or production phase is developed however are usually reserved to companies incorporated under the laws of angola although the companies may be entirely foreign owned the concept of trust does not exist in and is not recognised by angolan law in general there is little operating difference between a branch and a subsidiary in angola the main differences being a subsidiary is a separate legal entity while a branch has no autonomy from the foreign company that sets it up namely its head office the liability of the shareholders of a company is in principle limited to the amount of the company s share capital while a foreign company is fully responsible for the liabilities arising from the branch activities as the branch and head office are the same legal entity the company would be governed on corporate matters by one law only the personal law of the company typically the one where the company has its registered offices and conversely corporate documents issued by the foreign company at the head office level minutes of shareholders meetings board resolutions powers of attorney etc will always be subject to a more cumbersome and expensive procedure involving translation and several tiers of legalisation the costs of registering a branch are broadly similar to those of incorporating a local company although the latter are slightly higher local entity requirement is there a requirement that a local entity be a party to the transaction see question 13 bilateral investment and tax treaties are there jurisdictions with favourable bilateral investment treaties or tax treaties with your jurisdiction through which foreign entities will commonly structure their operations in your jurisdiction angola adheres to double taxation treaties with the china portugal and the united arab emirates portugal ratified its treaty on 14 february 2019 in addition the angolan national assembly has approved bilateral investment treaties between angola and the following countries brazil cape vert cuba france germany italy mozambique namibia portugal russia south africa spain switzerland the united states and the united kingdom financing principal sources of financing what are the principal sources of financing available to private parties carrying on mining activities what role does the domestic public securities market play in financing the mining industry private parties generally fund their mining activities in angola with loans granted by national and foreign banks angola has a stock market but remains in its infancy direct financing from government or major pension funds does the government its agencies or major pension funds provide direct financing to mining projects typically the government does not finance mineral projects private parties take out loans with banks or funds to fund their operations security regime please describe the regime for taking security over mining interests the mining code expressly provides that mineral rights may be pledged by way of credit security but only to secure credits contracted by the holder of the relevant mineral rights to finance the activities covered by the concession title the pledge is created by delivering an authentic copy of the title and the concession contract for the relevant mineral rights to the pledgee the holder of the mineral rights does not forfeit possession or the exercise of the mineral rights pledged and must still comply with all its legal and contractual obligations mineral rights pledged may not be transferred by the relevant holder nor encumbered again without the express prior authorisation of the pledgee restrictions importation restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the importation of machinery and equipment or services required in connection with exploration and extraction the mining code does not impose specific restrictions on the importation of machinery and equipment or services required in connection with exploration and mining in addition holders of mineral rights benefit from a customs duty exemption on the importation of goods for exclusive and direct use in carrying out mineral exploration evaluation reconnaissance mining and processing operations the exemption does not cover stamp tax statistical tax and miscellaneous service fees in the interest of protecting local industries the exemption does not apply if goods of the same or a similar quality available for delivery within a reasonable delay and at a price not exceeding by more than 10 per cent the cost of the imported item are available in angola standard conditions and agreements which standard conditions and agreements covering equipment supplies are used in your jurisdiction no standards apply although there is nothing preventing the parties from applying any standards they may deem appropriate mineral restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the processing export or sale of minerals are there any export quotas licensing or other mechanisms that prevent producers from freely exporting their production holders of mineral rights are allowed to market the products of mining in accordance with the conditions set forth in the mining code and the provisions of the relevant sale and purchase contracts export of minerals extracted in angola is subject to licensing by the relevant body of the ministry of commerce and to customs clearance by the customs national service the mmrp needs to be notified the relevant entity must issue a certificate of origin for all minerals extracted in and exported from angola the importation of any mineral in the national territory is subject to the prior favourable opinion of the mmrp when allowed the operation is always subject to standard customs clearance under the general terms of the law and to licensing by the ministry of commerce the body responsible for the mining sector is notified of the technical and quantitative data of importations of mineral resources as soon as the relevant operations are carried out for statistical and monitoring purposes regarding strategic minerals the executive branch may set up one or more marketing companies with a view to purchasing minerals directly from the producers in an open market regime the executive branch may promote the acquisition of certain types of strategic minerals by the above mentioned companies if it is required to do so to create a public reserve guarantee strategic stocks prevent the fall of market prices or for any other reason of public interest the marketing of diamonds is subject to specific export and marketing rules and must be made through the single channel institutionalised by sodiam under the new technical regulations for marketing rough diamonds a producer s right to sell their product in the angolan domestic or international market is subject to the following marketing quotas up to 60 per cent to buyers elected by producers from 15 20 per cent to sodiam and up to 20 per cent to the local cutting and polishing industry angola is party to the kimberley process certification scheme kpcs and has adopted the international system of certification of diamonds for export under the mining code and for the same reasons that led to the adoption of the kpcs for diamonds including those stated in united nations general assembly resolution 55 56 a similar certificate of origin should be issued for other strategic minerals that are to be exported import of funds restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the import of funds for exploration and extraction or the use of the proceeds from the export or sale of minerals the foreign exchange regime applicable to mining activities in angola is set forth in the mining code the bna order 2 03 presidential decree 175 18 and in certain provisions of the pil general foreign exchange law notably law 5 97 of 27 june 1997 applies to all matters on which the above statutes are silent as well as its ancillary regulations and instructions and orders from the bna subject bna control approval of mineral investment contracts entitles foreign investors to repatriate dividends pro rata to their investment capital operations and the import of funds are equally subject to foreign exchange restrictions even though applicable regimes vary for example the governor of the bna is entitled to make an assessment of whether in a given period the requested transfer of funds would result in difficulties in the balance of payments in which case he or she may impose conditions or suspend the transfer altogether environment principal applicable environmental laws what are the principal environmental laws applicable to the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws specific environmental requirements may be found in the mining code and in a contractual annex to exploration licences and mining titles dealing with environmental impact and recovery the annex in particular covers such areas as environmental impact preservation recovery and rehabilitation the precise regime in each case depending on the scope of the mineral rights awarded the general framework within which such provisions operate is derived from environmental statutes most significantly the following the general environmental law the decree on environmental impact assessment the decree on environmental licensing and the decree on environmental audits the national and regional sector strategy and programmes in the fields of environment and sustainable development as well as the international instruments to which angola has subscribed including the rio convention on biodiversity 1992 the montreal cartagena protocol on biosafety to the convention on biological diversity 2003 agenda 21 and the basel convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal 1989 the relevant regulatory body is the ministry of environment environmental review and permitting process what is the environmental review and permitting process for a mining project how long does it normally take to obtain the necessary permits projects that by their nature dimension or location bear upon the environmental and social balance and harmony shall be subject to environmental impact assessment eia which shall be made an integral part of the mineral investment contract operations in the mining phase are subject to such requirement as regards exploration evaluation and research activities much will depend on the activities in each case where such research work includes for instance the execution of trenches pits holes drilling or perforations and any work associated with it the impact upon the environment may be such that an eia may become legally necessary before the mining phase is reached the granting of environmental licences is subject to a fee closure and remediation process what is the closure and remediation process for a mining project what performance bonds guarantees and other financial assurances are required the holder of the exploration licence or mining title is liable for any damages caused by geological and mining activities penalties may be assessed and the holder is further subject to the obligation to pay damages regardless of contractual provisions generally in the mandatory eia it is already set forth how the closure of the project will be handled from an environmental standpoint as well as the environmental financial charges and the relevant financial guarantee mining titles frequently focus on the actions necessary for recovery and rehabilitation purposes eg dismantling and removing facilities and infrastructure reforestation social rehabilitation and watercourse restoration holders of mineral rights for exploration or mining of mineral resources at an industrial scale are required to post a bond to guarantee compliance with the contractual obligations including closure and remediation commitments the bond for the reconnaissance exploration evaluation and appraisal stage shall be of up to 2 per cent of the investment amount and at the mining stage of up to 4 per cent holders of mineral rights are further required to set up a legal reserve for purposes of mine closing and environmental restoration of an amount corresponding to 5 per cent of the investment restrictions on building tailings or waste dams what are the restrictions for building tailings or waste dams the eia must take contain numerous information concerning a waste management plan along with the assessment of the effects of the project on the environment the social impact of the projects the environmental management plan the environmental monitoring programme the environmental audits as well as the respective environmental reports the environmental restoration programmes the site abandonment plan the environmental financial charges the financial guarantee for the environmental charges the plans for water usage the waste management plans and the control of hazardous substances moreover holders of mineral rights are especially required to comply with the obligations deriving from the environmental impact study and the environmental management plan on the terms established therein to take the measures necessary to reduce the formation and propagation of dust waste and radiation in mining areas and surrounding areas to prevent or eliminate the contamination of waters and soil using appropriate means to that end not to reduce or in any other way prejudice the normal water supply to populations to carry out mineral operations so as to minimise damage to the soil to reduce the impact of noise and vibrations to acceptable levels as determined by the relevant authorities when using explosives in the vicinity of settlements not to discharge in the sea water currents and lagoons contaminant waste which is harmful to human health wildlife and flora and to inform the authorities of any occurrence which has caused or may cause environmental damage the mining code contains special rules for the protection of water resources ie in the mining process mineral operators must adopt the following measures for protection of water resources build decanting basins for sediments extracted during the ore processing stage to avoid polluting and silting rivers and lagoons create water recycling circuits to allow the reuse of water during the various mineral production stages perform periodic water analysis at numerous river locations within the concession allowing for quality control and keep updated records of information relating to the first three points above finally a technical manager must exist in each mining concession who is entrusted with the technical responsibility for the safety of the mine under his or her supervision for the technical conditions of mining and for the proper execution of the mining plan health safety and labour issues principal health and safety and labour laws what are the principal health and safety and labour laws applicable to the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws further to the specific provisions in the mining code angolan general labour law law no 7 15 of 15 june 2015 contains the key principles rules requirements and procedures applicable to employment in the mining industry there is also a fairly extensive number of ancillary statutes and regulations to consider the principal regulatory body is the ministry of public administration employment and social security management and recycling of mining waste what are the rules related to management and recycling of mining waste products who has title and the right to explore and exploit mining waste products in tailings ponds and waste piles apart from the applicable environmental rules there are no specific rules on recycling mining waste products there are also no specific titles to explore and exploit mining waste in tailings and waste piles use of domestic and foreign employees what restrictions and limitations are imposed on the use of domestic and foreign employees in connection with mining activities holders of mineral rights shall favour the hiring of angolan individuals preferably members of local communities over expatriates in addition to the above the general principle one may find under presidential decree 43 17 of 6 march 2017 is that at least 70 per cent of the workforce of an angolan or foreign employer that employs more than five workers must be angolan nationals this principle is considered by the angolan authorities as the minimum standard for the structuring of a company s workforce therefore only 30 per cent can be foreign non resident employees social and community issues community engagement and csr what are the principal community engagement or csr laws applicable to the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws angola has no specific legislation on the matter the mining code has a number of provisions on the rights of local communities residing in areas where mineral activities are to be carried out including the right to be consulted during the preparation of the eia and prior to any decisions being made that could affect their living conditions or rights such consultation is absolutely mandatory in the event that a mining project is likely to destroy or damage any assets or cultural or historical heritage belonging to the local community as a whole holders of mineral rights must relocate at their expense any local community that is displaced by reason of the mineral operations and all traditions customs and practices of local communities must be taken into account in the relocation process rights of aboriginal indigenous or disadvantaged peoples how do the rights of aboriginal indigenous or currently or previously disadvantaged peoples affect the acquisition or exercise of mining rights angola has no specific legislation on the matter international law what international treaties conventions or protocols relating to csr issues are applicable in your jurisdiction angola has no specific legislation on the matter anti bribery and corrupt practices local legislation describe any local legislation governing anti bribery and corrupt practices corruption is specifically addressed in a few statutes in angola such as the law on the criminalisation of the infractions relating to money laundering law no 3 14 of 10 february 2014 and the public probity law law no 3 10 of 29 march 2010 there are also scattered provisions in the criminal code the customs code and public procurement law more recently the national assembly resolved to ratify the african union convention on preventing and combating corruption foreign legislation do companies in your country pay particular attention to any foreign legislation governing anti bribery and foreign corrupt practices in your jurisdiction yes particular attention is paid to the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act disclosure of payments by resource companies has your jurisdiction enacted legislation or adopted international best practices regarding disclosure of payments by resource companies to government entities in accordance with the extractive industries transparency initiative eiti standard no foreign investment foreign ownership restrictions are there any foreign ownership restrictions in your jurisdiction relevant to the mining industry as mentioned in question 13 the only restrictions relate to mineral rights for diamond artisanal production which may only be granted to angolan citizens and those relating to minerals for diamond semi industrial mining civil construction or mining rights of mineral rich waters which may only be granted to companies organised under angolan law in which angolan citizens hold at least two thirds of the capital international treaties applicable international treaties what international treaties apply to the mining industry or an investment in the mining industry besides the bilateral investment

resolution 8 08 of 21 january 2008 mozambique resolution 90 09 of 6 october 2009 and south africa resolution 33 05 of 5 august 2005 update and trends recent developments what were the biggest mining news events over the past year in your jurisdiction and what were the implications what are the current trends and developments in 2019 in your jurisdiction s mining industry legislation major cases significant transactions aside from the much publicised ongoing reform of the petroleum sector the angolan mining sector has also been subject to significant innovations most of which aimed at enhancing the sector s performance transparency and potential for growth despite the government s efforts in diversifying and promoting investment within the mining sector the focus still lies in the diamond subsector as evidenced by the approval of a new diamond marketing policy technical regulations for the marketing of diamonds and the new semi industrial mining of diamonds regulations this focus resulted in the recently enacted 2018 22 national development plan that forecasts a substantial increase in diamond production more investment in local cutting and polishing facilities are also

the headquarters of bank of canada in ottawa canada the bank of canada boc will diverge from the us federal reserve s expected policy easing path and keep interest rates on hold at least through this year according to economists in a reuters poll who said however that the risk of a recession has risen the fed the european central bank and other major central banks are set to embark on an easing policy in coming months or already have to combat sluggish inflation and slowing economic growth exacerbated by global trade tensions but the boc will take a different route and keep its key interest rate on hold at 1 75 through to the end of next year at least according to the poll of nearly 40 economists taken on july 1 4 supported by recent upbeat domestic activity that bias though is expected to change next year as growth takes a hit indeed not only has the probability of a boc easing for both this year and next risen there are more economists now who predict at least one rate cut at some point before the end of next year compared to the previous poll in may back then forecasters were split in three directions about the boc s policy path but now about 40 with a view to end 2020 expect the bank to cut rates at least once including two respondents predicting it to happen this quarter only a handful said the central bank will hike rates next year for the bank of canada there is no rush to cut interest rates at the same time with the fed moving relatively aggressively to cut interest rates the boc by next year will have to cut at least once in order to prevent the canadian dollar from appreciating too strongly said benjamin tal deputy chief economist at cibc so the question is how long can you divorce yourself from the fed if you are the boc and i say not for too long that lines up with the view of currency strategists in a separate poll who predict the canadian dollar will stay firm against the dollar in a year as a recovering domestic economy forestalls boc interest rate cuts a deterioration in us china trade tensions a broader chinese ban of canadian products a canadian dollar soaring above 80 us cents coming from the fed cutting aggressively would then force the boc to join the easing bias camp said sebastien lavoie chief economist at laurentian bank the poll showed the canadian economy is forecast to lose momentum considerably slowing to a growth rate of 1 5 by the end of next year from the 2 2 expected for the previous quarter over 80 of economists responding to an additional question said the risk to that already modest growth outlook was skewed more to the downside while us president donald trump provided some temporary relief at the g20 summit the chances of a recession in canada have increased with no let up yet in trade uncertainty the median probability of a recession in the next 12 months rose to 25 compared to april s 20 the chances of a recession in the next two years rose to 35 from 27 5 trade concerns and sluggish global demand will likely squeeze recent gains in the price of oil canada s key export according to a separate reuters poll that will keep inflation around the central bank s target of around 2 in check inflation was expected to average 1 9 this year and 2 next from 1 8 and 2 in april canada s nascent mid year rebound is expected to be short lived as lingering domestic challenges a slowing global and us economy and lower rates in the us may prompt the boc to cut rates later this year said tony stillo director of canada economics at oxford economics the canadian dollar was little changed against its us counterpart on thursday holding near an earlier eight month high which was notched after a number of recent data releases pointed to a pick up in the domestic economy the canadian dollar was trading nearly unchanged at 1 3055 to the greenback or 76 60 us cents the currency touched its strongest level since oct 25 last year at 1 3038 while its weakest was 1 3079 the narrow range for the currency came as markets were closed in the united states for the independence day holiday there is certainly decent momentum for the canadian dollar given the string of strong and somewhat surprising data said michael goshko a corporate risk manager at western union business solutions data last friday showed faster than expected growth in canada s economy in april while a report on wednesday showed a surprise swing in the may trade balance to surplus canada s jobs report for june is due on friday until the data begins to really soften in canada the boc is going to be standing pat as far as the eye can see that s certainly at odds with what is going on in the united states reuters

i first met christine lagarde in 2008 when she was french finance minister i represented the us on the international monetary fund board at a time when she was the managing director lagarde s nomination to the european central bank s presidency has rightfully generated much positive commentary but a chorus of doubters and negativism has also emerged another french head will alienate the frugal german men and women on the street even if chancellor angela merkel backed her lagarde is not a phd economist she has never served in a central bank ignore the negativism it misses the mark the critique isn t ready for prime time and it won t be what is a successful recipe for a central bank head these days relevant experience is one key no lagarde has not worked in a central bank but she has been a finance minister and head of the imf for eight years she been involved in all the key monetary policy discussions of the last decade having had to fight the global financial crisis first hand as french finance minister she is well familiar with financial stability and regulatory issues even if the fund isn t a central bank or a true lender of last resort the m in imf stands for monetary sound economic views are another europe s economy is anaemic inflation is persistently low and undershooting its target indeed the euro area may hit its next shock with an official deposit rate already in negative terrain europe needs lots of things structural reforms fiscal support in some countries where space exists and rectitude elsewhere and it needs monetary policy accommodation only the latter is in the ecb s remit while some in europe may argue for less accommodation and inveigh against negative rates and quantitative easing lagarde can be expected to support vigorous continued data dependent accommodation well into the future she will likely follow in mario draghi s footsteps on this front she also very well may politely chide germany for its massive surpluses and over saving no doubt she ll also correctly tell italy to pursue sensible fiscal policies aimed at bringing down its debt to gdp ratio after all the imf is said to stand for it s mostly fiscal and to be an advocate for european structural reform she may push the euro area to create a centralised fiscal capacity and perfect the banking union this is the right orientation central banking is increasingly about communication with markets lagarde is universally seen as an effective and highly skilled communicator while taking on the ecb press corps may be more challenging than her experiences to date she will be well prepared for the challenge and have a good media team around her the head of an organisation should be a good manager though this skill is often disregarded in institutions that is not an issue here in my experience lagarde runs a tight ship including disciplined meetings that begin punctually and with an expectation that everybody pays attention when she chaired imf board meetings i always made sure fearfully to show up at least two minutes in advance lest i be late i didn t follow that practice for the deputy managing directors of course that didn t spare me from an occasional salvo to put down my blackberry or an admonition to finish my presentation at the fund she chose her leadership team well and with care the ecb is an excellent organisation with first rate intellectual talent to those concerned she is not a monetary policy guru of the likes of former federal reserve chair ben bernanke and you can count such gurus on less than the five fingers on your hand in any case but she will be able to tap into the tremendous expertise of the ecb and the eurosystem more generally at the imf she was quite effective at drawing on the strong skills of staff the head must be politically savvy and a good diplomat she has attended all the g20 finance ministers and leaders gatherings for years and travelled the globe as a tireless ambassador for the imf her work and unparalleled energy only burnished the fund s global standing in short this quality needs no discussion she is outstanding on these fronts oh yes how could i forget not every phd monetary policy economist necessarily has brilliant or practical thoughts to offer and i ve even seen some central bank governors raise interest rates just when a recession was brewing mark sobel is us chairman of omfif

mining industry standing what is the nature and importance of the mining industry in your country uzbekistan s mining industry is one of the country s most important and strategic industries uzbekistan is one of the world s largest producers of gold ranked eighth and uranium ranked seventh uzbekistan also produces copper silver coal phosphate molybdenum potassium tungsten lead zinc and other minerals target minerals what are the target minerals uzbekistan possesses most types of minerals different regions focus on different minerals for example navoi province is famous for its large deposits of gold and uranium and tashkent province for copper coal and gold deposits regions which regions are most active the most active regions are navoi samarkand and tashkent provinces legal and regulatory structure basis of legal system is the legal system civil or common law based uzbekistan s legal system is based on civil law which is similar to the romano germanic system of law regulation how is the mining industry regulated exploration and development of minerals is regulated under a number of national laws and regulations exploration and mining rights are granted on the basis of a subsoil use licence awarded to the subsoil user through tenders or direct negotiations by the state committee of the republic of uzbekistan on geology and mineral resources what are the principal laws that regulate the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws were there any major amendments in the past year the main act regulating the mining industry is the law on subsoil no 444 ii new edition dated 13 december 2002 the subsoil law the subsoil law provides the fundamental legal framework governing exploration and development of all subsoil resources including minerals and oil and gas the subsoil law provides for state licensing and control rights and obligations basic rules regarding efficient use of resources types of subsoil use duration of subsoil use and other matters the industry is also regulated under a number of other laws and regulations including the resolution of the president of uzbekistan on terms and conditions on granting of subsoil use rights no pp 649 dated 7 june 2007 regulation pp 649 the tax code the land code the labour code and the environment protection law it shall be noted that regulation pp 649 established a procedure for granting a licence on subsoil use rights for all subsoil minerals excluding construction materials granting subsoil use rights for exploration and development of deposits of construction materials is regulated by the resolution of the cabinet of ministers of the republic of uzbekistan on terms and conditions on granting of subsoil use rights for deposits of construction materials no 443 dated 12 june 2018 in addition to the above the law on concessions dated 30 august 1995 provides a legal basis for this form of right to develop mineral resources however this law has not yet been widely applied in practice to date there have not been any examples of concessions being negotiated and entered for mining projects in uzbekistan the difference between the regulatory framework in uzbekistan and that of other countries is in the absence of any separation between mining and petroleum law and a common approach towards regulation of the mining industry and the oil and gas industry the confusion is exacerbated by the law on production sharing agreements dated 7 january 2001 the psa law the psa law applies in addition to the subsoil law in the case of affairs related to the conclusion execution and termination of production sharing agreements psas in the exploration and mining of mineral resources in uzbekistan the principal regulatory bodies that administer the laws and regulations related to mining are the state committee of the republic of uzbekistan on geology and mineral resources geology committee the state inspectorate of the republic of uzbekistan on control over industrial safety of works in industry mining geology and public utilities sectors industrial safety inspectorate and the state committee of the republic of uzbekistan on protection of the environment environment protection committee on 24 may 2017 the uzbek president passed the resolution on measures for expediting attraction of foreign investments for geological studies and development of strategically important types of hard minerals no pp 3000 regulation pp 3000 regulation pp 3000 has provided investors more simplified procedures for discussing potential projects with the geology committee accessing geological data subsoil deposits and prospective areas and also boosted a high level of interest from investors as the next step and in order to implement objectives introduced by regulation pp 3000 the cabinet of ministers of the republic of uzbekistan passed resolution no 328 dated 31 may 2017 on the establishment of selection criteria and the lists of prospective areas and deposits of strategically important hard minerals where foreign investments are attracted for geological studies and industrial development regulation no 328 regulation no 328 has approved lists of 29 subsoil deposits and 111 prospective areas where the government plans to attract foreign investment in areas that include small and medium sized subsoil deposits and prospective areas of various minerals including gold silver copper uranium tungsten rare metals and so on classification system what classification system does the mining industry use for reporting mineral resources and mineral reserves uzbekistan s mineral resource and reserve reporting system is quite different from generally recognised international systems such as the canadian institute of mining standards australia s joint ore reserves committee code or the south african code for the reporting of exploration results mineral resources and mineral reserves uzbekistan along with many other commonwealth of independent states countries still uses the former soviet system for classifying mineral resources and reserves this categorises mineral concentrations according to the extent to which they have been explored and substantiated specifically categories a b c1 and c2 and three categories of potential resources p1 p2 p3 and also on an economic value basis with two categories balance reserves commercial reserves and off balance reserves reserves lacking commercial potential mining rights and title state control over mining rights to what extent does the state control mining rights in your jurisdiction can those rights be granted to private parties and to what extent will they have title to minerals in the ground are there large areas where the mining rights are held privately or which belong to the owner of the surface rights is there a separate legal regime or process for third parties to obtain mining rights in those areas under the subsoil law all subsoil resources are owned by the state title to minerals passes from the state to the subsoil user on extraction from the ground pursuant to the terms of the subsoil use licence any transfer of subsoil ownership rights including the right of use to a non state party is subject to approval by the uzbek cabinet of ministers uzbekistan differs from many other countries where there is private ownership of minerals in the ground and where landlords have title to all mineral resources located under their plots of land all subsoil resources in the ground until extracted are owned by the state surface rights do not grant rights to natural resources in the ground and in this way are clearly distinct from mineral rights publicly available information and data what information and data are publicly available to private parties that wish to engage in exploration and other mining activities is there an agency which collects mineral assessment reports from private parties must private parties file mineral assessment reports does the agency or the government conduct geoscience surveys which become part of the database is the database available online usually geological data held by the geology committee is treated as state secret and the geology committee makes high level information publicly available such as the names of given deposits their location and respective mineral reserves as recognised by the state usually this information is publicly available through the websites of government agencies such as the geology committee the agency on information support and foreign investments promotion and the annual geological conference uzgeoinvest sufficient basic geological data to prepare an aggregated feasibility study for exploration activities or a preliminary feasibility study for mining activities is provided by the geology committee in the course of conducting tenders or direct negotiations for the right to develop a particular deposit or exploration area this information may be disclosed to investors subject to their signing a confidentiality agreement a more detailed package of geological information regarding a certain deposit or subsoil area is made available to the licensee after the relevant licence for subsoil use rights has been granted acquisition of rights by private parties what mining rights may private parties acquire how are these acquired what obligations does the rights holder have if exploration or reconnaissance licences are granted does such tenure give the holder an automatic or preferential right to acquire a mining licence what are the requirements to convert to a mining licence uzbekistan uses a licensing system for the granting of exploration and mining rights therefore subsoil use rights are granted on the basis of a subsoil use licence awarded to the subsoil user on behalf of the cabinet of ministers by the geology committee such licences are usually awarded either through tenders or direct negotiations the primary obligations of the mineral rights holder include obligations to use the allotment only for the purposes stipulated in the licence comply with standards and rules on technology of conducting subsoil use operations comply with the work programmes on development of operations draw up geological survey and other documents in the process of the development of mineral deposits the use of subsoil for other purposes not connected with the mining of minerals and to protect their safety keep records of the volume and quality of extracted and reserved principal and other jointly deposited mineral resources preserve extracted but temporarily unused associated subsoil resources ensure compliance with standards of loss when mining minerals and processing mineral raw materials not exercise selective extraction of rich blocks within the licensed area update the geology committee on the status of and changes in reserves of the principal and other jointly deposited subsoil resources provide information on the volume of extracted subsoil resources to the geology committee ensure the safety of human life health and the natural environment ensure safe execution of work connected with the use of subsoil and taking of measures for the prevention of extraordinary situations and elaboration of plans to eliminate accidents observe the established procedure for closure and conservation of enterprises for mining of minerals and underground structures not associated with mining of minerals ensure execution of works connected with planning or terracing of dump slopes and pit edges as well as erosion preventive measures and restore land plots and other natural features that have been disturbed as a result of subsoil use operations to a condition suitable for further use depending on the type of the subsoil use the licence may include other obligations the subsoil law and regulation pp 649 grant the exploration licence holder a right to progress from exploration to mining activity and states that a party or parties that financed the exploration activities on a given deposit shall have an exclusive right to obtain a licence for mining activities on the same deposit the exploration licence holder is usually treated as the financier of exploration activities and has the exclusive right to progress to mining activities there is no automatic transfer from exploration to mining licence the subsoil law and regulation pp 649 provide that the mining licence must be granted upon the application of the party that financed the exploration activities the application must be supported by documents proving that exploration activities on a given deposit were financed by an applicant and disclosing the source of financing notarised copies of a certificate of incorporation and constitutive documents of the applicant information on the executive management and shareholders of the applicant and information on technical and technological capacities of the applicant demonstrating that the applicant is capable of performing the intended activity on development of the deposit and ensuring production and also information on contractors to be involved in performance of the intended activity in addition the geology committee may request submission of copies of an applicant s or its contractors licences and permits for carrying out certain types of activities connected with the subsoil use renewal and transfer of mineral licences what is the regime for the renewal and transfer of mineral licences the term of a licence may be extended provided that a subsoil user applies to the geology committee not less than six months before expiry of the validity period of a licence pursuant to the subsoil law the geology committee must take a decision on whether to grant the extension within 30 days of the submission of the extension application usually this decision is closely coordinated with the government the extension is subject to the subsoil user s compliance with the terms and conditions of the licence and the subsoil user demonstrating that it requires an extension to complete exploration or mining activities on a given deposit the subsoil law and regulation pp 649 are silent on the transfer of licences with respect to exploration activities and only provide these rights with respect to licences for mining mineral resources and licences for use of technogenic mineral generations these licences can be transferred partially or in full to another party provided that this party undertakes all obligations under the licence transfer of licences is carried out by a licence holder submitting an application to the geology committee with an indication of the reasons for the transfer the application shall be supported by the documents confirming that the party to whom the rights under the licence are being transferred meets the licence requirements the geology committee prepares the information related to the licence transfer and coordinates it with the relevant ministries and state agencies recommendations of the ministries and state agencies are further submitted to the government regarding the decision whether to approve or reject the transfer of the licence duration of mining rights what is the typical duration of mining rights generally mining rights are granted for the following exploration activities for a term of five years with the possibility of renewal for the new term and mining activities for the duration of the mining activities in accordance with the project s feasibility study mining rights under psas are granted for the period of duration of a particular psa renewal of mining rights is carried out through filing a licence application with the licensing authority and requesting to issue a licence for the new term mining rights may be suspended restricted or prematurely terminated in the circumstances specified by the subsoil law such as failure to commence use of a subsoil plot within one year from the date of subsoil plot allotment repetitive failure to make subsoil use payments and breach of main terms and conditions of a licence etc acquisition by domestic parties versus acquisition by foreign parties is there any distinction in law or practice between the mining rights that may be acquired by domestic parties and those that may be acquired by foreign parties generally there is no distinction and foreign individuals and legal entities can directly hold mining rights in uzbekistan uzbekistan has managed to build a powerful mining industry over the past 40 years thanks to rich uranium and gold deposits most of the subsoil deposits are being developed by two major state owned mining companies or by joint ventures with these companies navoi mining metallurgical combine se nmmc and almalyk mining metallurgical combine jsc ammc thus in practice priority in providing mining rights with respect to large deposits of strategic minerals such as gold silver copper and uranium are given to these companies at the same time the government continues to seek and attract foreign investors employing innovative technologies and best practices and there are examples of successful cooperation with large western and asian companies protection of mining rights how are mining rights protected are foreign arbitration awards in respect of domestic mining disputes freely enforceable in your jurisdiction mining rights may be suspended restricted or prematurely terminated in the circumstances specified by the subsoil law subsoil users are free to choose a judicial body for protection of the rights and they may refer their disputes either to the uzbek economic courts or foreign arbitrations unlike foreign court judgments foreign arbitral awards shall be recognised in uzbekistan without retrial on the merits because uzbekistan is party to the new york convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards 1958 new york convention accordingly a foreign arbitral award obtained in a state that is party to the new york convention should be recognised and enforced by an uzbek economic court subject to the qualifications in the new york convention and compliance with uzbek civil procedure and the procedures established by the uzbek law on commercial arbitration for the enforcement of arbitration decisions surface rights what types of surface rights may mining rights holders request and acquire how are these rights acquired can surface rights holders oppose these requests for mining purposes and in order to secure mining rights private parties must acquire the surface rights to relevant land plots surface rights as such are usually acquired after the mineral licence has been granted and at the stage of construction or development of the project to the extent that the surface rights are required although the land code provides for other types of land rights such as the right of permanent or temporary use in practice foreign companies or joint ventures engaged in mining activities are granted a lease right to land all land rights must be registered with the local state cadastre authority in addition regulation pp 649 provides that subsoil use rights become effective upon registration of such rights by the geology committee in the state register of the subsoil use rights further the terms of a licence for mineral extracting activities will provide that the mine allotment must be granted by the industrial safety inspectorate the right to the use of a land plot is linked to the subsoil use rights such that any changes in the title of the subsoil use rights transfer or termination will lead to corresponding changes in the rights to use the land plot theoretically surface rights holders can oppose requests for the surface rights however since the land belongs to the state and is provided to surface rights holders for temporary or permanent use only the government is entitled to transfer the land from one to another holder for higher priority needs participation of government and state agencies does the government or do state agencies have the right to participate in mining projects is there a local listing requirement for the project company yes through its state agencies committees or wholly owned state companies the government participates in mining projects currently most of the subsoil deposits are being developed by the two major state owned mining companies nmmc and ammc also the geology committee has established a number of joint ventures with foreign investors for prospecting and exploring potential fields in uzbekistan generally there is no local listing requirement for the mining project companies in uzbekistan in 2018 the state transferred management in leading state owned metallurgical companies including ammc and uzmetcombinat jsc umc to the professional international trustee management companies in addition the uzbek president passed a resolution on further improvement of activities of the companies in the mining industry no pp 4124 dated 17 january 2019 which introduced several important objectives for the largest state owned companies of the industry including implementing international standards of financial reporting and audits starting from 2019 year results implementing minimum requirements for economic efficiency of sale of assets their turnover and obligations in accordance with the requirements of international stock exchanges and financial institutions and implementing intergovernmental working group of experts on international standards of accounting and reporting and global reporting initiative standards of reporting beginning from 2020 year results etc further by 1 july 2019 the government is to develop a concept of reforming and development of the large companies of the mining industry which shall include attracting the investors for local sourcing process outsourcing and international initial public offering listing for the following companies umc during 2022 ammc during 2023 and nmmc during 2023 nmmc is required to complete the process of transformation from the state enterprise into joint stock company by 1 december 2019 and management in the nmmc is to be transferred to the professional international trustee management companies based on a tender government expropriation of licences are there provisions in law dealing with government expropriation of licences what are the compensation provisions the subsoil law is silent on expropriations of licences by the government however the law on guarantees and measures for protection of foreign investors rights dated 30 april 1998 law on protection of foreign investors rights provides that foreign investments and any other assets of foreign investors located in uzbekistan cannot be nationalised or confiscated except in the instance of natural disasters accidents epidemics and epizootics in the event of nationalisation in the said circumstances the government is obliged to provide the affected foreign investor with compensation of an amount equal to the damage caused as a result of the nationalisation the law further provides that the state shall be a guarantor of timely payment of compensation to the foreign investor protected areas are any areas designated as protected areas within your jurisdiction and which are off limits or specially regulated some areas hold a special status where mining works may be either prohibited eg in natural parks or restricted eg in frontier zones and certain types of agricultural land duties royalties and taxes duties royalties and taxes payable by private parties what duties royalties and taxes are payable by private parties carrying on mining activities are these revenue based or profit based uzbekistan s tax code specifies several special taxes payable by subsoil users including mining companies in addition to general taxes such as corporate income tax 12 per cent vat 20 per cent social tax 12 per cent excise and customs duty tax on petrol and other mandatory duties as follows subsoil use tax gold 25 per cent silver 25 per cent copper 15 per cent zinc 10 per cent uranium 10 per cent and coal 4 per cent is calculated on the value of the mineral resources produced and is payable on a quarterly basis for small entities and on a monthly basis for other types of entities the value of the mineral resources for purposes of subsoil use tax is generally determined using the average weighted sales price for the reporting period subscription bonus gold 10 000 times the minimum monthly wage mmw copper 1 000 times mmw and uranium 500 times mmw is a one time fixed payment to the state for the right to explore and extract minerals in accordance with a subsoil use licence commercial discovery bonus 0 1 per cent is a fixed payment that is payable by subsurface users when a commercial discovery is made in the licensed territory the rate of the commercial discovery bonus is determined on the basis of the value of proven extractable reserves the value of the mineral resources is generally determined using the market price established at international exchanges excess profits tax 50 per cent is payable in respect of certain types of minerals which are determined in accordance with legislation in 2019 only natural gas copper cement clinker and polyethylene pellets were subject to excess profits tax and psas the uzbek tax code specifies the special tax regime for foreign companies conducting activities under psas thus a foreign investor its contractors and subcontractors under a psa are exempt from payment of all types of taxes and mandatory duties with regard to exploration activities further during the period of the psa a foreign investor is required to pay corporate profit tax land tax water use tax excise tax social tax and special taxes for subsoil users subscription bonus and commercial discovery bonus excluding excess profits tax incentives granted to a foreign investor under the psa are exemption from payment of vat and property tax and exemption from customs duties that would otherwise be levied upon imported goods and works purported for activities under the psa and upon export of products belonging to a foreign investor in accordance with the psa a non resident company operating or acting through a permanent establishment usually service companies must pay a profit tax from its activity in uzbekistan at the rate of 12 per cent domestic parties are not subject to this tax although they must withhold 10 per cent withholding tax from dividends distributed to their foreign shareholders the rate of dividends withholding tax may also be reduced under relevant double tax treaties no special tax incentives excluding the incentives under psas referred to above are generally available to companies conducting mining activities in uzbekistan however it may be possible to negotiate tax incentives directly with the state these are granted by uzbek president s special resolution tax advantages and incentives what tax advantages and incentives are available to private parties carrying on mining activities generally no special tax incentives are provided to companies conducting mining activities in uzbekistan tax stablisation does any legislation provide for tax stabilisation or are there tax stabilisation agreements in force there are no direct tax stabilisation provisions under the uzbek tax code except for general provisions on stability of laws provided by a number of legislative documents pursuant to the law on protection of foreign investors rights foreign investments are protected from any subsequent changes in uzbek law which may worsen investment conditions for a period of 10 years from the date of the investment in contrast to the law on protection of foreign investors rights the psa law provides similar stability provisions but for the entire period of validity of the psa without 10 years limitation pursuant to the psa law if after the signing of the psa uzbekistan adopts any laws or other legal acts that lead to deterioration of commercial results of the foreign investor s operations under the psa then the provisions prescribed under the psa continue to be applicable to the foreign investor this rule does not apply to the changes made in the laws with respect to standards for safety of works preservation of mineral resources environmental protection and health of the population carried interest is the government entitled to a carried interest or a free carried interest in mining projects currently the concept of carried interest or a free carried interest is not used in uzbekistan with respect to mining projects transfer taxes and capital gains are there any transfer taxes or capital gains imposed regarding the transfer of licences currently the uzbek tax code does not provide for a clear procedure of determining of capital gains with respect to transferred rights especially if the entity receiver of the capital gain is located outside of uzbekistan however the most recent trends show that such entities located outside of uzbekistan are viewed by local tax authorities as receivers of the capital gain and are thus subject to the tax on capital gains in uzbekistan distinction between domestic parties and foreign parties is there any distinction between the duties royalties and taxes payable by domestic parties and those payable by foreign parties generally the same tax regime applies to domestic companies and foreign companies whose activities in uzbekistan create a permanent establishment for uzbek tax purposes otherwise foreign companies are subject to uzbek withholding tax with respect to certain uzbek sourced income such as dividends interest royalties and other similar income subject to reduction or elimination under any applicable double tax treaty further income received from the provision of goods work and services that creates no permanent establishment in uzbekistan is not subject to any uzbek withholding tax the uzbek tax code specifies the special tax regime for foreign companies conducting activities under a psa see question 19 business structures principal business structures what are the principal business structures used by private parties carrying on mining activities the subsoil law contains no restrictions with respect to the business structures that may be used for the purpose of conducting mining activities in uzbekistan the subsoil law allows any form of legal entity whether local or foreign to acquire mining rights in uzbekistan the two most commonly used business forms in uzbek mining activity are the limited liability company llc and joint stock company jsc the law allows for a jsc and an llc to each be used for either joint ventures or 100 per cent foreign owned subsidiaries local entity requirement is there a requirement that a local entity be a party to the transaction as a general rule there is no requirement that subsoil users enter into the transactions with only local entities however in practice the state through the geology committee or its mining companies is usually involved in mining activities of strategic or high revenue projects by participation in joint ventures with foreign investors also there is a general expectation on the subsoil users to use locally manufactured equipment materials and finished products wherever possible as well as to engage local organisations for works and services in the course of subsoil use operations bilateral investment and tax treaties are there jurisdictions with favourable bilateral investment treaties or tax treaties with your jurisdiction through which foreign entities will commonly structure their operations in your jurisdiction operations in uzbekistan are often structured through holding companies located in other jurisdictions and in most cases through dutch swiss and singaporean holding companies owing to favourable tax treaties with those countries financing principal sources of financing what are the principal sources of financing available to private parties carrying on mining activities what role does the domestic public securities market play in financing the mining industry the subsoil law does not regulate the financing of mining activities and mining companies are free to choose their funding sources in practice the principal sources of financing are a user s own funds and funds borrowed from foreign private financing institutions such as the european bank for reconstruction and development the asian development bank the international finance corporation etc debt financing is subject to registration with the central bank of uzbekistan cbu unless borrowings are made for a period of no more than 360 days in addition registration with the cbu is subject to regular reporting to the cbu which monitors the relevant debt financing agreement it should be noted that there is currently no well established legal framework in uzbekistan for the domestic securities market that could enable mining companies to issue domestic bonds or commercial papers direct financing from government or major pension funds does the government its agencies or major pension funds provide direct financing to mining projects usually direct financing is provided by the government to state owned mining companies pension funds are not involved in the financing of mining projects security regime please describe the regime for taking security over mining interests imposing security interests over any type of subsoil use licence is not enforceable under uzbek law restrictions importation restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the importation of machinery and equipment or services required in connection with exploration and extraction there are no direct limitations or restrictions imposed on the import of machinery and equipment or services in connection with mining activities although certain types of machinery and equipment may fall under limited restrictions eg equipment with integrated radio frequency devices note that import operations are subject to uzbek exchange control requirements such as registration of import contracts with a local servicing bank and customs authorities imported items should conform to uzbek technical standards standard conditions and agreements which standard conditions and agreements covering equipment supplies are used in your jurisdiction fidic standard conditions are quite popular in uzbekistan the market is friendly to the suppliers and buyers although the government s policy during the past decade in this respect has been focused on bringing innovative technologies and solutions to uzbekistan and encouraging local manufacturing of innovative technologies in partnership with leading global companies and subsequent exports and domestic use of these technologies see question 14 for dispute resolution practices mineral restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the processing export or sale of minerals are there any export quotas licensing or other mechanisms that prevent producers from freely exporting their production there are no general requirements in the subsoil or psa laws that some or all minerals produced must be processed or sold domestically however the psa law provides for a pre emptive right of uzbekistan in case of emergency to buy mineral resources produced by the subsoil user on a priority basis prices and other details of such purchase entitlement have to be set out in the psa the psa law does not expressly provide otherwise and in practice the ministry of finance is entitled to this pre emptive right import of funds restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the import of funds for exploration and extraction or the use of the proceeds from the export or sale of minerals in 2003 uzbekistan followed article viii of the international monetary fund treaty to ensure free and unrestricted conversion of local currency into foreign currency for current operations in accordance with the law the conversion of national currency into hard currency must be carried out within five business days in the past companies engaged in business activities in non strategic sectors of the economy eg retail trade etc experienced delays with converting national currency into hard currency however in september 2017 the uzbek government announced and managed to implement free convertibility of national currency into hard currency to date we are unaware of any restrictions or delays environment principal applicable environmental laws what are the principal environmental laws applicable to the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws the main act in the area of environmental protection is the law on environmental protection no 754 xii dated 9 december 1992 as amended which sets out the rights and duties of individuals and legal entities provides for the regulation of and control over environmental protection and provides a general framework for environmental impact assessment and environmental monitoring in addition it provides requirements for the use of radioactive materials atomic energy and dangerous chemical substances other key acts regulating environmental protection are as follows the land code the law on

regulatory bodies in these areas are the environmental protection committee and the industrial safety inspectorate environmental review and permitting process what is the environmental review and permitting process for a mining project how long does it normally take to obtain the necessary permits there are several types of environmental licences and permits subsoil users must obtain before carrying out their activities the law on environmental assessment no 73 ii requires subsoil users prior to financing works on construction of mining projects to obtain a conclusion on environmental assessment from the specialised department of the environment protection committee as to compliance of the intended activity with ecological requirements and that measures undertaken by the subsoil user on environmental safety ensure the sufficiency and feasibility of efficient use of mineral resources the subsoil users must also obtain permits for the following discharging pollutants into the environment water consumption setting air pollution limits and waste disposal obtaining a conclusion on environmental assessment and all other required environmental permits and licences may take up to one month and on sophisticated projects up to three months closure and remediation process what is the closure and remediation process for a mining project what performance bonds guarantees and other financial assurances are required the subsoil law and regulation pp 649 require that subsoil users conduct closure and remediation the closure and remediation terms and conditions are usually different and depend on certain environmental operational and other external circumstances of each mining project therefore the subsoil law and regulation pp 649 only set out general rules on closure and remediation and require that such specific provisions be included in the mining licences no performance bonds guarantees or other financial assurances are required of a subsoil user upon closure of a mining project pursuant to the general rules established by the subsoil law subsoil users must conduct closure and remediation at their own expense except for instance where mining rights are prematurely terminated by the government owing to an emergency situation in the past mining companies were required to establish special reserve funds for mine reclamation purposes restrictions on building tailings or waste dams what are the restrictions for building tailings or waste dams construction and exploitation of tailings or waste dams for the purposes of storing and burying of mining wastes is carried out based on a licence issued by the environment protection committee by way of direct negotiations of licence applicant with this agency the person in charge of the operation and management of waste dams shall have relevant technical qualification and be certified by the industrial safety inspectorate to operate and manage waste dams the environmental protection committee and the industrial safety inspectorate as principal controlling bodies of safe exploitation of waste dams are entitled to carry out ad hoc and scheduled inspections of the facilities mining companies exploiting waste dams inspections are usually carried out once a month mining companies are responsible for safe exploitation of waste dams and are obliged to implement emergency response procedures to prevent damage to people animals and the environment in the event of dam failure health safety and labour issues principal health and safety and labour laws what are the principal health and safety and labour laws applicable to the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws uzbekistan has a broad range of laws regulating labour relations the main element of which is the uzbek labour code the labour code however there are no special requirements standards or labour rules applicable to labour relations in the mining industry as for work safety the general issues related to health and safety at work are governed by the labour code as well as by the law on industrial safety on hazardous manufacturing objects dated 26 september 2006 and the law on labour protection dated 6 may 1993 these statutes impose on employers a considerable number of obligations related to ensuring safe working conditions and work safety including obligations to ensure that working conditions at each workplace meet work safety requirements that the employees use individual and collective protective gear that the employees observe the work and rest regime provided for by uzbek law and that a work safety service is established etc finally each employer is required to develop an extensive set of various labour safety rules and regulations as well as numerous other documents relating to work safety the principal regulatory body administering health and safety and labour laws is the ministry of labour and social protection of the population and industrial safety inspectorate management and recycling of mining waste what are the rules related to management and recycling of mining waste products who has title and the right to explore and exploit mining waste products in tailings ponds and waste piles the law on wastes no 362 ii dated 5 april 2002 as amended law on wastes establishes fundamental rules on managing storing and recycling waste products

payments for storing of waste etc the law on wastes establishes that owners of waste are responsible for the management and recycling of waste products including hazardous waste note that activity on exploring and exploiting mining waste products in tailing ponds and waste piles is subject to licensing use of domestic and foreign employees what restrictions and limitations are imposed on the use of domestic and foreign employees in connection with mining activities there are no restrictions or limitations specifically imposed on the employment of domestic or foreign employees in connection with mining besides the limitation set by the psa law pursuant to the psa law one of the main conditions of carrying out works under psas is that the number of uzbek citizens in these works shall not be less than 80 per cent of the average annual number of employees and the use of foreign personnel above this quota is only allowed in the case of the absence of uzbek citizens with the appropriate

when the ukrainian banking sector or the country s financial institutions take center stage in a foreign jurisdiction it is usually for regrettable reasons that s certainly the case in delaware a small american state with a reputation as a tax haven there ukraine s largest bank finds itself at the center of a case that could expose the biggest money laundering scheme in world history privatbank currently state owned is suing its former owners oligarchs igor kolomoisky and gennadiy boholyubov as well as multiple business associates in the delaware court of chancery simultaneously the federal bureau of investigation or fbi has opened a criminal investigation into kolomoisky and his alleged co conspirators privatbank is seeking to prove that in the course of a decade its former owners engaged in large scale money laundering into the united states parking hundreds of millions of dollars in various commercial real estate projects this is a civil suit but many of its multiple accusations are fundamentally criminal in nature if the civil case is successful it could eventually lead to criminal indictments and extradition orders for the two oligarchs in 2016 the ukrainian government nationalized privatbank after investigators discovered it had a 5 5 billion hole in its ledger and faced collapse although financiers international experts and ukrainian civil society support the nationalization kolomoisky and boholyubov are challenging it in the ukrainian courts both oligarchs have repeatedly denied all past and present allegations of wrongdoing capital flight while privatbank and its ongoing cases in london geneva and now the u s tax haven of delaware have become headline grabbing examples of alleged fraud and money laundering they are representative of a much larger challenge for ukraine experts say that countless smaller cases of laundering and illicit capital flight are still crippling the economy in one recent example the kyiv post found that the founder of ukrainian medical company eurolab broadcaster and businessperson andriy palchevsky sits at the head of a caribbean scheme that appears designed to launder money or avoid tax palchevsky has 10 shell companies registered to a residential address close to london where a local accountant admitted to the kyiv post that he was managing the books records show that those companies are registered to the well known tax haven of charlestown nevis in the caribbean experts from the organization for economic cooperation and development have branded nevis non cooperative in its efforts to combat money laundering and it has become a haven for dirty money some of that money definitely came from ukraine this remains a problem for our country in fact the ukrainian model currently seems to be capital exporting rather than capital importing said constantin solyar a taxation lawyer and partner at the asters law firm in kyiv while ukraine has made some efforts to adopt international standards clean up its banking sector and recover capital and assets that have been plundered or otherwise moved abroad much of it could be lost forever banks which were used specifically for money laundering operations were removed from the market with the cleaning up of the banking system by the national bank of ukraine nbu said oleksii filipov an expert with the kpmg accountancy and auditing firm as a result classic banks now face the risk that they could be used for such operations unwittingly filipov added prosecution for financial crimes remain rare and the courts have failed to back lawmakers who attempted to clamp down judges and decisions are still up for sale and judicial reform remains stalled viktoriya fomenko a tax expert at the integrites law firm in kyiv said that laundering continues to take place despite the nbu s efforts to clamp down only during 2019 the regulator the nbu has imposed twelve sanctions on banks for violations of its money laundering rules the effective implementation of anti money laundering measures is not possible in ukraine without anti corruption regulations fomenko said adding that the courts have been unhelpful on the issue by declaring unconstitutional the criminal code article on illegal enrichment in february the constitutional court gave a green light to such illegal funds and consequently their laundering the stakes are high for ukraine and damage to the collective national wealth due to income and assets being shadily hidden in foreign jurisdictions is considerable state coffers lose out on essential taxation revenue some 40 50 billion each year according to multiple independent legal experts who have spoken to the kyiv post experts attribute that loss to ukraine s collective wealth equivalent to nearly a third of the country s current total gross domestic product to a combination of tax evasion tax avoidance aggressive tax planning practices and profit shifting the amount lost due to criminal money laundering out of ukraine is much more difficult to estimate tackling laundering while developed western countries pressure ukraine to reform its judiciary and tackle corruption their own bankers accountants and lawyers often play a part in money laundering the united states and the united kingdom play a particular role in illicit capital flight as do the low tax jurisdictions where much of the laundered cash ends up such as delaware in the united states or caribbean islands like nevis the virgin islands and the caymans experts say that the national bank of ukraine for its part has been trying to stem the outflow the nbu has implemented a risk based approach for supervision to prevent money laundering said filipov of kpmg it includes remote monitoring of transactions and onsite inspections the aim of the approach is to implement leading international practices in this area the ukrainian government needs to implement rules on extraterritorial incomes and foreign entities that are owned by ukrainians legal experts say these rules are measures to combat tax avoidance when a taxpayer in one country establishes an entity in an offshore jurisdiction and diverts the income to the foreign entity solyar said corruption and illegal economic activities put ukraine among states with significant money laundering risks adds fomenko strong ties with international financial institutions like the international monetary fund and the european bank for reconstruction and development play an important role she says these institutions make ukraine move down the path of reforms and significantly and positively affect anti money laundering in ukraine massive fraud in delaware privatbank would like to teach ukraine and the bank s former owners a valuable lesson about oversight transparency and the rule of law american and ukrainian investigators have alleged that a decade of embezzlement took place at privatbank with the former owners and their associates using it as their own personal piggy bank for 90 percent of the bank s lending now investigators attention is also shifting to what they allege was international money laundering on an unprecedented scale through privatbank s base in cyprus and ultimately into delaware and the wider united states privatbank has assembled a cohort of lawyers and public relations specialists to fight kolomoisky and boholyubov the bank s leadership is confidently on the offensive but tight lipped about details the bank has developed its legal strategy with consultants and we are quite confident overall anna samarina privatbank s deputy chair and cfo told the kyiv post at a banking conference in london in the cases ongoing at the moment in various jurisdictions there are evidences which have been proven by investigators evidence of fraud and the fraudulent schemes done through the bank she added however samarina is not only referring to the alleged 5 5 billion hole found in the bank s books back in 2016 the latest case filed in the u s by privatbank s lawyers against kolomoisky and boholyubov also implicates three american co defendants and 19 proxy companies in the states it alleges that during the decade spanning 2006 to 2016 470 billion was laundered through privatbank cyprus while hundreds of millions of dollars worth of privatbank s misappropriated loan proceeds were pumped into the united states and invested into commercial real estate projects if proven in the american courts it would be the biggest case of money laundering ever privatbank investigators have done extraordinary detective work and this is probably the most detailed study of large scale money laundering into the united states that runs 104 pages though it has not been proven in court yet writes anders aslund a senior fellow at the atlantic council this case shows how money laundering from ukraine to the united states allegedly takes place the ultimate problem is that the united states allows the formation of hundreds of thousands of anonymous companies that have permeated this country with laundered money warning signs with privatbank cases ongoing in the background the broader prognosis for the ukrainian banking sector is cautiously optimistic however the unpredictability of the courts continues to create anxiety in ukraine and among outside observers the banking sector is stable but fragile to external shocks especially of a political or judicial nature according to experts who gathered in london on june 11 for ukrainian banking day privatbank was the elephant in the room during panel discussions meanwhile igor kolomoisky haunted the debate largely unmentioned by name off the agenda completely was any discussion of money laundering financial crime or tax evasion the financial sector is in the best shape ever said kateryna rozhkova deputy governor of the nbu however the ukrainian judicial system is still corrupt she added and susceptible to being used for leverage by the oligarchs court decisions on privatbank especially ones that could reverse its privatization are a huge threat to ukraine s financial stability rozhkova added court rulings against privatbank have been felt by us said samarina but we have not been hurt valeria gontareva who was nbu governor until she resigned in may 2017 told the kyiv post that privatbank is a litmus test for ukrainian reforms and justice she said nbu independence must be fiercely protected while civil society and lawmakers should look for warning signs that its impartiality is under attack she said it was possible that this was already taking place in the courts and kyiv s corridors of power and that president zelensky could make changes at the nbu that would be helpful to igor kolomoisky or could appoint people who might protect him or promote his interests he is the devil she said

here s our summary of key events overnight that affect new zealand with news the next us fed rate decision just got more complicated firstly non fram payrolls in the us rose much more than expected in june up 224 000 and smoothing out the very low may result but that may result was actually revised even lower the average for the two months isn t flash the average for the past three months is below par as well in the june result factory payrolls only rose a modest 17 000 reinforcing the weak survey results that the regional feds have been reporting in its semi annual report to congress the fed

local government 29 000 and in transportation 23 900 these four accounted for about 70 of the overall rise the other 22 categories accounted for the rest average hourly earnings are up 3 1 over the past year wall street is down on these results figuring that the us fed is now less likely to add monetary juice any time soon if current payroll growth is running at about its 2018 average the s p500 is down 0 2 although that is less than the 0 5 falls recorded in europe earlier asian markets ended flat on the day the us fed next reviews its policy rate on august 1 nzt given that us economic growth in q2 seems to be running at only 1 3 the chances of a rate cut while they may have receded are not zero still with their mandate for both foster employment and a 2 price stability with the us jobless rate now at 3 7 and inflation at 1 8 it will be hard to make the case that some emergency policy shift is required in canada it might be even more complicated their inflation is running at 2 4 but overnight their jobs data for june was particularly weak with jobs falling 2 200 in june and their unemployment rate rising to 5 5 in germany things are clearer even if they are not good factory

london reuters the euro was stuck near two week lows on thursday and the dollar drifted away from recent highs as sliding government bond yields pressured both currencies the global bond rally has accelerated this week on expectations of more monetary easing from central banks although the impact on foreign exchange markets has been limited with overall volatility remaining low markets were closed in the united states on thursday for its independence day adam cole an fx strategist at rbc capital markets said that while the big drop in u s treasury yields was negative for the dollar the outright yield advantage that the united states enjoyed over other countries was supporting demand for the greenback and minimizing the spillover into higher volatility the dollar isn t falling much compared to how much u s yields are coming down it s explained by the level of yields rather than the rate of change he said the euro traded slightly higher at 1 1286 it has weakened since imf managing director christine lagarde perceived as a policy dove was nominated as the next european central bank president the dollar index was marginally lower at 96 734 the dollar has weakened in recent weeks as expectations build for a federal reserve rate cut later this month although the index is off three month lows of 95 843 plumbed in june trade tensions waning expectations for a quick resolution of the u s china trade row have also hurt sentiment towards the dollar adding to a sense of unease about trade talks u s president donald trump on wednesday repeated his view that china and the euro zone are manipulating their currencies but the dollar remains the dominant reserve currency international monetary fund data released recently showed the dollar constituted 58 of global foreign exchange reserves in the first quarter of 2019 up marginally from the previous quarter and far above the euro s 19 share the focus now shifts to u s non farm payrolls data due on friday which economists expect to have risen by 160 000 in june compared with a rise of 75 000 in may some analysts think the dollar will hold its own in the coming months although the japanese yen could act as a decent hedge should the rally in global stocks come to an end jpy strength is one area of the fx space which we think will be a net drag on the value of the usd over the coming 3 6m despite the fact that the usd should continue to hold up well vs the eur and the rmb chinese renminbi said stephen gallo a strategist at bmo capital markets the yen was up slightly at 107 78 yen per dollar above five month lows of 106 78 yen touched in june the aussie was down 0 1 to 0 7022 after earlier hitting a two month high sterling changed hands at 1 2575 near two week lows hit on wednesday after investors raised their bets that the bank of england would follow other central banks and ease policy editing by gareth jones by tommy wilkes
the canadian dollar was flat on thursday as the volume in the market was subdued with the fourth of july holiday in the states the loonie has risen as the market is pricing in more than one rate cut by the federal reserve this year president trump continues to pile pressure on the fed to depreciate the currency via lower rates as he compares the lack of effort from the fed as what the ecb and other central banks are doing the bank of canada boc has turned dovish but not enough to signal a rate cut in the near term improving fundamentals have given the central bank some breathing room with steady growth and higher exports next up for the cad will be the release of the canadian employment data on friday last month was a pleasant surprise as a small correction was expected after the monster jobs gain published on may 10 the forecast calls for 10 000 positions to be added but a miss would not be a surprise given the gain in the april jobs report us employment has been a steady pillar of the economy so when the nfp showed a big miss last month it validated the market pricing a fed rate cut the lower than expected jobs report triggered a bout of pessimism about us growth and the need for the fed to drop its patient stance and go the full 180 degree turn on interest rates the us economy could add 165 000 jobs but given the importance of the indicator a lower number combined with a miss on the wage growth component could be another dagger for the us dollar as it would get the fed even closer to announcing a rate cut when the fomc meets at the end of the month oil oil lower on global growth concerns oil prices fell close to 1 percent on thursday the lack of volume due to the us independence day was a factor with traders looking for the market to regain full force ahead of the release of the us employment report for june us crude inventories registered another drawdown but given the expectations set by the api a day earlier it was a miss by shrinking for less than anticipated global growth remains the main factor holding back crude prices trade disputes have hurt estimates as more agencies and central banks downgrade growth forecasts as trade headwinds get stronger without shutting the door on the us china dispute the us has now targeted the eu manufacturing data around the globe is beginning to show signs of deceleration attributed to the trade war one of the main reasons behind central banks so eager to restart the easing engines is the pressure protectionism is putting on economic growth so they must step in with more stimulus even though their arsenal is depleted the opec announced a 9 month extension to their production cut agreement after a successful meeting between saudi arabia and russia in japan in the sideline of the g20 russia played hard to get until the end but given the low forecasts they have for internal budget current prices are acceptable it is the volatility that could put pressure on russian producers to break away from the group but that is something for next year to ponder the opec deal will keep prices from falling too hard but there must be an end to trade protectionism to assure the demand for energy products recovers oil is also under pressure from higher us production the us is now positioned to become a net exporter and is not bound by the production limit agreement this could further drive prices lower gold gold drops slightly but awaiting signs of us economic slowdown gold fell 0 2 percent during the thursday trading session the fourth of july holiday came at the right time for the us dollar as it gave the currency time to get its footing after fed fund rate cut anticipation had depreciated the greenback the nfp report on friday could add another soft data point to the narrative of a slowdown of american growth the fed was forced to a 180 degree turn after lifting its benchmark rate in december and being on the verge of cutting the interest rate to avoid a recession gold has risen as the fed preached patience and is now ready to remove some of the tightening it added last year the yellow metal is also having a moment as it retakes the safe haven crown away from the us dollar trade uncertainty in particular more than one trade front open at the same time has given the edge to gold in the eyes of investors despite a cordial meeting between trump and xi at the g20 the biggest takeaway was a restart of negotiations negotiations that are still far apart in key topics with neither side willing to concede geopolitical concerns are keeping gold bid as the middle east situation could once again flare up with the us taking a less diplomatic approach to iran and although awaiting a new leader the uk is gearing to get brexit done once and for all stocks indices mixed ahead of us jobs report the fourth of july holiday made for a low volume day of trading with most major indices stuck in a tight range awaiting the u s non farm payrolls nfp due on friday equities have rallied on the back of a most likely rate cut by the federal reserve and the lower than expected us private payrolls report earlier in the week the fed is independent from the white house even though president trump has been very aggressive that the us central bank needs to lower rates and depreciate the dollar to make us exports more competitive the fed is likely to cut the benchmark rate later this month by 25 basis points this fact alone has boosted stock markets around the globe and put pressure on the dollar and bonds emerging markets offer higher yields to investors so they will be more attractive as major economies are looking to cut rates or keep them low risk appetite has improved but the biggest obstacle for an em rally is a full blown trade war us china remains unresolved and the us is looking to pick a tariff fight with the eu the rally in equities has been driven by dovish central bank rhetoric the stock market has not been too concerned with the trade war as the tariffs have avoided hitting consumer goods so far there is still upside if a true trade agreement materializes between the us and china and the fed keeps cutting rates as expected geopolitical issues like brexit middle east tensions and the trade war have been an inconvenience but not enough to derail the record setting pace a resolution on such fronts could expand the bullish run into next year but as more headwinds add up it could signal the end of the party content is for general information purposes only it is not investment advice or a solution to buy or sell

by here s an inconvenient truth to chew on over the fourth of me holiday if al gore sr had gotten his way the dmz rendezvous between kim and trump would likely never have taken place as alexander cockburn and i reported in our biography of al gore the old man wanted to saturate the dmz with radioactive waste as a permanent deterrent to re unification in the wake of trump s sessions with putin mbs and kim tucker carlson tried to educate the foxnews audience about the power dynamics of today s realpolitik you ve got to be honest about what it means to lead a country it means killing people a lot of countries commit atrocities including our allies of course there s a fine line which tucker seems to have rather gleefully transgressed between teaching and advocacy the anti tucker dan rather castigated trump in for his deeply strange behavior at the g20 summit i wonder who writes the great liberal s opinions these days in joan didion s after henry she notes that in the early 80s peggy

duty in the iraq kuwait theater of operations was in 2009 when she was platoon leader for a military police unit this was five years after sy hersh had exposed the sadistic practices of the mps at abu ghraib rahul mahajan if gabbard evolved why is she always bragging about her experience good question gabbard who is still a member of the national guard reserve appeared in uniform so many times during political campaign events through at least 2018 that she was reprimanded by the pentagon gabbard s supporters depict her as a pat tillman like figure carried away by the revenge fantasies that swept america after 9 11 but tillman had turned against the iraq war before he was sent to fight it and quickly saw even the afghanistan war for the debacle it is which probably explains why he was killed murdered by friendly fire the fact that gabbard returned intact from her two tours of duty in iraq suggests that her awakening was very recent indeed at one point in her adult life gabbard viewed both palestinians and homosexuals as sub human no wonder she was so excited to lead a military police unit in iraq five years after the sadism at abu ghraib had been exposed quite the trio here miriam adelson gabbard and orthodox rabbi shmuley boteach holding his book the israel warrior not exactly peter paul and mary with philanthropist miriam adelson and congresswoman tulsi gabbard of hawaii at our gala dinner on 5 may pic twitter com ghuxvwolxa rabbi shmuley rabbishmuley may 17 2016 here s gabbard speaking in 2015 before the ultra zionist group christians united for israel in gabbard it looks like the magaleft has finally found a cop they like when people ask me what i mean by the magaleft here s a case study in the species our political culture is so deeply militarized that it prioritizes those who turned against a war well after their own tours of duty kerry gabbard et al over those who opposed the war from the beginning the two putative anti war candidates in the democratic party sanders and gabbard are polling at around 15 percent combined this is either evidence of the weakness of both candidate or the fact that the democratic party itself remains stubbornly indifferent as it has been for 50 years to the urgent matters of war and peace probably both here s the front runner joe biden during his 2002 floor speech before the iraq war vote president bush did not lash out precipitously at iraq after 9 11 he did not snub the u n or our allies he did not dismiss new inspection regimes he did not ignore congress at each pivotal moment he has chosen a course of moderation and deliberation and i believe he will continue to do so trump and we re gonna have some tanks stationed outside so we have to put them in certain areas but we have the brand new sherman tanks and we have the brand new abram tanks no new sherman tanks have rolled off the assembly line in 60 years our yankee doodle dandy gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane when melania catches up with me won t be no time to explain she thinks i ve raped another woman and that s enough to send her half insane my apologies to the ox trump s amassed more firepower on the mall for his fourth of me celebration than the total military arsenal of 112 countries including flyovers by a b 2 stealth bomber to two f 35cs two super hornet f 18s four apache helicopters two f 22 raptors h 60 and h 65 helos along with the blueangels and air force one i d gladly trade 3 abrams tanks on the mall for the banishment from dc of 3 much more dangerous think tanks brookings heritage and the center for international studies too bad the media spent a week ranting over the weapon porn display on the fourth and almost no time exploring how those weapons are being used in out the real world in yemen for example estimated fatalities in yemen by year 2015 17 100 2016 15 100 2017 16 800 2018 30 800 2019 11 900 in 2017 total arms sales for the world s 100 largest defense contractors topped 398 billion according to the pentagon the war in afghanistan costs 45 billion a year which works out to 123 287 671 each day the park service lost 11 million in entrance fees during trump s government shutdown now he is diverting 2 5 million from the park service budget to fund his fourth of me party on the mall meanwhile park service rangers have been diverted to the border to help cbp strip children from their aunts and grandmothers and put them in cages i don t care what the ivy league pinkos write in their fake history books son if the man says there were airports during the war of 1812 believe him trump s fourth of me fest could have been worse instead of celebrating defense contractors he could have feted the profession that gave us the declaration of independence lawyers if i were programing the music for the fourth of me star spangled banner jimi hendrix god bless amerika lil wayne crazy horse john trudell this land is your land pete and arlo fortunate son ccr my country nas i m so bored

other hand consider the cast of characters trump might have filled those empty slots in the us arms control office with albert einstein nationalism is an infantile disease it is the measles of mankind one of the shared mindsets that once united americans on the political left and right was that most of us grew to hate our rulers a few months after they had assumed power the recent cults of trump and obama the noxious cult of kennedy only really formed after the assassination have spoiled the true spirit of independence day abu ghraib on the border cbp leadership was told in 2016 about offensive posts to secret facebook group including images of border patrol agents simulating sex acts taking selfies while shitting and one of an agent smiling while holding what appeared to be a human skull this is the depraved meme the ice and border patrol agents posted of aoc on their private site i m usually of the disposition that not matter who is at the helm the system doesn t change course much except at the margins but there are more and more signs of a deepen rot nick estes watching aoc get shouted down outside a literal concentration camp to hide the crimes of this country

cndbr907r7 waleed shahid _waleedshahid july 3 2019 repressive immigration laws are as old as the republic itself and just as politically motivated then as today see the alien and sedition acts signed into law by john adams in 1798 there was also the naturalization act of 1790 which limited citizenship to immigrants who were free white persons of good character thus prohibiting naturalization for native americans indentured servants freed slaves and all asians the law was only fully repealed in 1952 to paraphrase claud cockburn don t believe anything the trump administration says until it has been officially denied by trump trump s new border tsar ken cuccinelli once compared us immigration policy to washington s rodent control program claiming incorrectly it turns out that the d c regulation that doesn t let animal control workers kill rats is worse than u s immigration policy because you can t break up rat families or raccoons and all the rest and you can t even kill em it s unbelievable lakota law project reminder most of the people in cages are indigenous to the americas many of the people with the keys are immigrants in a new cnn poll 93 of democrats and 60 of independents disapprove of the treatment of migrants by trump administration 62 of republicans approve of the treatment of migrants by trump administration what were those numbers when obama was locking up thousands of kids in 2014 and earning the nickname deporter in chief or did the press even bother to inquire a little racism with your morning coffee and beignets from nyt columnist and trump resistance hero bret stephens they speak spanish we don t they are not u s citizens or legal residents we are they broke the rules to get into this country we didn t they pay few or no taxes we already pay most of those taxes they willingly got themselves into debt we re asked to write it off they don t pay the premiums for private health insurance we re supposed to give up ours in exchange for some v a type nightmare they didn t start enterprises that create employment and drive innovation we re expected to join the candidates in demonizing the job creators breaking up their businesses and taxing them to the hilt charlotte delbo mothers keep a tight hold on their children trembling at the thought they might be taken away because the children are hungry and thirsty and disheveled by lack of sleep after crossing so many countries auschwitz and after whenever trump and tucker carlson shoot the breeze they come up with some freaky sounding shit trump when we have leaders of the world coming in to see the president of the united states and they re riding down a highway they can t be looking at that they can t be looking at scenes like you see in los angeles and san francisco so we re looking at it very seriously we may intercede we may do something to get that whole thing cleaned up it s a phenomenon that started 2 years ago it s disgraceful you can t have where police officers are getting sick just by walking the beat i mean they re actually getting very sick this is the liberal establishment biden on the 2010 idf attack on the gaza flotilla that killed nine peace activists i spent a lot of time going to the un directly making sure one thing was made clear israel had the right had the right to impose that blockade like his buddy jesse helms biden pushed for tough economic sanctions against cuba he even internally opposed obama s proposals for loosening restrictions on travel to cuba the right of cuban americans to send remittances for family members still living there fact checking the washington post s fact checker on bernie sanders statement that the three richest americans own more wealth than the bottom 50 percent the failure of biden s voluntary school desegregation aka busing plan is the reason the federal courts imposed mandatory school desegregation aka busing busing itself is a pejorative term deployed by biden like politicians meant to scare suburban middle class white families from a 1975 nyt editorial on biden s attempt to end forced desegregation of public schools the principal tragedy of the biden amendment is that it would signal a major crumbling of federal determination to achieve equal justice the biden amendment is thus a real threat not only to the gains of the sixties but to decency in this society as biden tries to use obama as a human shield to deflect attention from his racist policies on education let s remember that public schools were almost as segregated under obama as they were when the civil rights act was signed and some of their policies exacerbated only the disparities while the department of education has paid lip service to the need to promote integrated schools and has included modest diversity incentives within a handful of federal grants it refused to use larger education initiatives like race to the top to encourage states and districts to prioritize school diversity in some cases the department actually pushed policies that made segregation worse obama s education secretary arne duncan was a more competent and thus more destructive version of betsy devos the democrats are really going to run this guy as their candidate for president biden who swears he doesn t have a racist bone in his body and has fought for civil rights his entire career if you have a piece of crack cocaine no bigger than a quarter we passed a law thru leadership of sen thurmond and myself that says you go to jail for 5 years if you snort the powder up your nose don t worry you re good during an event in seattle biden was hissed at by the crowd after he said that five years ago it was okay to make gay waiter jokes biden must be perplexed these routines prompted guffaws when he auditioned for the lunchtime crowd at his assisted living compound back in wilmington biden can always be counted on to commit a new gaffe while trying to explain a previous gaffe because the gaffe actually reflects what he really believes we ve got to recognize that kid wearing a hoodie may very turn out to be a poet laureate and not a gangbanger joe biden is a walking concordance of freudian parapraxes if biden uses the word folks one more time in a speech pete seeger is going to rise from his grave and whack him in the head with his banjo i ve always been mystified by the argument that hrc lost the election because she didn t spend enough time in wis michigan and pennsylvania wouldn t those visits have convinced even more voters to stay home or vote for jill stein or gary johnson bernie sanders seems to have hit the political doldrums his poll numbers are lagging and his fundraising trails even mayor butter eggs i m far from a sanders fan but i thought his debate performance was gritty even if he did seem to be showing his age sanders hammered the same points he always does in part because these are the core issues of american politics that never vary but people are saying they ve heard it all before and looking for something fresh perhaps this explains kamala harris appeal her inconsistency she s capable of giving 57 different explanations for her position on universal health care here we have the eternal obsession of msdnc and its sponsors on full display people think of trump as being uniquely corrupt among us presidents he s not when reagan left office his pals got together and bought ron and nancy a house in bel air the house was purchased for 2 3 million even though two very similar houses on the same block had sold that year for more than 10 million each back when a million meant something in the la real estate market not to mention the aisles of gifted couture dresses that hung in nancy s wh boudoir harvard s douglas elmendorf s said the

mining industry standing what is the nature and importance of the mining industry in your country the quality and quantity of ecuadorian mineral resources is similar to those of its neighbours such as chile and peru who have managed to develop their mining potential however most of ecuador s territory is still unexplored in fact according to the financial times ecuador has some of the most attractive gold silver and copper deposits in latin america nevertheless production has been almost non existent there are many reasons for the delay in developing this industry but the main reasons rest with poor public policy regarding the mining industry and the absence of legal security owing to legislation largely inspired by the oil industry in terms of the mining industry s importance within ecuador given the trend in the drop of oil prices and because ecuador is traditionally an oil dependent country it is difficult to imagine any industry other than mining being capable of attracting foreign investment to further develop the country target minerals what are the target minerals currently the target minerals in ecuador are gold silver and copper however there is large potential for other minerals such as lithium rare earth potash iron uranium and coal ecuador has an even broader geological potential but to an extent the minerals targeted depend on global trends and the interest of individual companies there is no material development on renewables so far but experts predict that the current industry is moving towards more efficient ways of generating energy during the next five to 10 years regions which regions are most active the most important gold and copper deposits discovered to date are located in the south of ecuador principally in the zamora chinchipe morona santiago azuay and el oro provinces however it is also important to consider imbabura province in the north of ecuador owing to the region s considerable future mining potential legal and regulatory structure basis of legal system is the legal system civil or common law based the ecuadorian legal system is civil law based regulation how is the mining industry regulated according to the constitution the state owns all minerals and non renewable natural resources within its territory such minerals and resources are considered strategic sectors and are managed regulated controlled and governed by the state the state can on an exceptional basis delegate the development of the extractive sectors to individuals or entities by granting mining concessions for a term of 25 years thus the concessionaire will have the exclusive right to explore exploit process and sell any metallic minerals within the concession when a project is considered for large scale mining prior to the commencement of the exploitation phase the concessionaire must first sign an exploitation contract with the ecuadorian state this contract is not needed when a project is in the range of artisanal small or medium scale mining the mining act defines artisanal mining as that which is carried out for the subsistence of family units through the use of manual equipment or portable devices daily production quotas for artisanal mining are for metallic minerals up to 10 tonnes in underground mining and up to 120m3 in alluvial mining for non metallic minerals up to 50 tonnes and for construction materials up to 100m3 in alluvial deposits and 50 tonnes for hard rock open pit mining the daily production quotas for small scale mining are for metallic minerals up to 300 tonnes in underground mining up to 1 000 tonnes in open pit mining and up to 1 500m3 in alluvial mining for non metallic minerals up to 1 000 tonnes and for construction materials up to 800m3 for alluvial terrace mining and up to 500 tonnes for open pit mining the daily production quotas for medium scale mining are as follows for metallic minerals 301 1 000 tonnes in underground mining 1 001 2 000 tonnes in open pit mining and 1 501 3 000m3 in alluvial mining for non metallic minerals 1 001 3 000 tonnes and for construction materials 801 2 000m3 for alluvial terrace mining and 501 1 000 tonnes for hard rock open pit mining quarries any range that exceeds those established for medium scale mining is considered as large scale mining what are the principal laws that regulate the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws were there any major amendments in the past year overall there are several legal provisions regarding the mining industry within the constitution additionally there is the mining act the general mining regulations the small scale and artisanal mining regulations and the environment act there is also the mining environmental regulations for mining activities the principal regulatory body that regulates and controls the industry is the ministry of energy and non renewable natural resources which replaced the former mining ministry the other relevant bodies are the ministry of the environment the mining regulation and control agency arcom and the national geological mining investigation institute inigemm in addition with the mining act the national mining company enami ep was created which is responsible for developing state mining projects by itself or in association with private or public companies or both regarding major amendments during 2018 the government eliminated the windfall profit tax within the mining industry classification system what classification system does the mining industry use for reporting mineral resources and mineral reserves the mining regulation and control agency arcom enacted the mineral resources and reserves regulations which is based on the australian joint ore reserves committee the canadian national instrument ni 43 101 the uk reporting code and the south african code for reporting of mineral resources and mineral reserves mining rights and title state control over mining rights to what extent does the state control mining rights in your jurisdiction can those rights be granted to private parties and to what extent will they have title to minerals in the ground are there large areas where the mining rights are held privately or which belong to the owner of the surface rights is there a separate legal regime or process for third parties to obtain mining rights in those areas the state owns the non renewable natural resources within the national territory the state can on an exceptional basis delegate the development of extractive sectors to individuals or entities by granting mining concessions for a term of 25 years where the concessionaire will have the exclusive right to explore exploit process and sell any metallic minerals within the concession see question 5 once the mining concession has been granted in large and medium scale mining the concessionaire is subject to the following phases and terms up to four years of initial exploration up to four years of advanced exploration and up to two years of economic evaluation of the deposit which can be extended for an additional two year period during the final phase the concessionaire must apply for the commencement of the exploitation phase of the project within six months of beginning the exploitation phase the concessionaire in the large scale mining category must sign a mining exploitation contract with the ecuadorian government although negotiations may begin during the economic evaluation phase as indicated artisanal small and medium scale mining operations do not need to sign a mining exploitation contract with the ecuadorian government ownership of mining concessions is distinct from ownership of the surface land according to the mining act in order to obtain a new mining concession applicants must participate in a public tender process in accordance to the guidelines for granting metallic mining concessions if a concessionaire wishes to transfer an existing concession to a third party authorisation from the mining authorities must first be obtained however it is important to consider that a new mining concession cannot be transfer at least for two years from the granting date the mining cadastre is temporarily closed owing to state internal planning activities by the government therefore it is not possible to apply reserve or grant new concessions for mining companies publicly available information and data what information and data are publicly available to private parties that wish to engage in exploration and other mining activities is there an agency which collects mineral assessment reports from private parties must private parties file mineral assessment reports does the agency or the government conduct geoscience surveys which become part of the database is the database available online arcom keeps a register of all the concessions that exist in the country mining cadastre to this end a reference map of the location of mining concessions can be accessed online at according to the mining act all mining concessionaires should submit annually exploration reports and investment plans in order to have their concessions in good standing arcom and the national geological mining investigation institute are the government agencies responsible for carrying out geoscience surveys and technical analyses of national geological information and collecting information for the national database this information is public but unfortunately not all is available online acquisition of rights by private parties what mining rights may private parties acquire how are these acquired what obligations does the rights holder have if exploration or reconnaissance licences are granted does such tenure give the holder an automatic or preferential right to acquire a mining licence what are the requirements to convert to a mining licence individuals or corporations may acquire mining concessions which are granted by the ministry of energy and non renewable natural resources following a public tender process the mining act recognises four mining categories artisanal small scale medium scale and large scale production ranges for each category are set out in question 5 existing mining concessions can be transferred provided that prior authorisation from the mining authorities has been obtained the obligations of mining rights holders among others are to pay annual mining conservation patent fees to present annual exploration reports and investment plans to present biannual production reports to pay mining royalties to the state during the exploitation phase to obtain an environmental licence prior to commencing activities to obtain administrative authorisations prior to commencing activities to ensure at least 80 per cent of its workforce are ecuadorian to comply with the environmental management plan to comply with the regulatory and the mining title duties and obligations to train their personnel to maintain information regarding their operations etc and to obtain prior administrative authorisation renewal and transfer of mineral licences what is the regime for the renewal and transfer of mineral licences according to article 36 of the mining act a mining concession is granted for up to 25 years and may be renewed for an equal period upon a written application by the mining concessionaire to the ministry of energy and non renewable natural resources it is possible to transfer mining rights prior authorisation from the ministry of energy and non renewable natural resources and is based on a technical report prepared by arcom a new mining concession cannot be transferred for at least for two years from the granting date see question 8 duration of mining rights what is the typical duration of mining rights a mining concession is granted for up to 25 years subject to renewal for an equal period upon a written application by the mining concessionaire to the ministry of energy and non renewable natural resources see question 11 there is no specific condition that needs to be meet in order to renew the mining concession it is important to note that the ministry of energy and non renewable natural resources may exercise its legal authority and consequently declares the mining rights terminated in cases where the concessionaires have rendered themselves liable to such termination for the reasons laid down in the mining act throughout any termination procedure the right to due process shall be guaranteed the process of declaring termination may be officially instigated by the ministry of energy and non renewable natural resources in response to a complaint by a third party that has been duly investigated by the ministry of energy and non renewable natural resources or at request of other ministries with a connection to mining activity the administrative procedure shall be subject to the terms of the mining act and its general regulations acquisition by domestic parties versus acquisition by foreign parties is there any distinction in law or practice between the mining rights that may be acquired by domestic parties and those that may be acquired by foreign parties domestic and foreign parties are equally entitled to acquire mining rights in ecuador protection of mining rights how are mining rights protected are foreign arbitration awards in respect of domestic mining disputes freely enforceable in your jurisdiction according to ecuadorian legislation mining is considered to be of public interest which means it is in a special category and is granted more protection than other private interests including land ownership if a concessionaire suffers any form of disruption as a result of a third party s actions concessionaires can file an administrative relief action in arcom which can take either direct or indirect preventive measures the mining act specifically states that in the event of a dispute arising out of an exploitation contract made between the ecuadorian state and a mining concessionaire such a dispute can either be resolved by the local courts or may be submitted to international arbitration however the dispute can only be submitted to international arbitration if arbitration provisions are included in the contract the seat of arbitration must be in a latin american country as required by the constitution foreign international awards are fully enforceable in ecuador surface rights what types of surface rights may mining rights holders request and acquire how are these rights acquired can surface rights holders oppose these requests private parties may acquire any form of surface rights from ownership of the surface area to leases usufructs easements etc if a mining concessionaire wishes to acquire an easement over a surface area in order to develop its mining operations it can either enter into an agreement with the surface owner or request that arcom impose an easement note however that foreigners individuals or corporations cannot acquire any surface rights within border zones considered to be an area within 20km of the national border see question 48 surface rights holders cannot oppose these requests because mining rights are considered of public interest participation of government and state agencies does the government or do state agencies have the right to participate in mining projects is there a local listing requirement for the project company according to article 315 of the constitution the state may participate in the development and management of natural resources through public companies such as enami ep or through mixed public private companies in which the state should be the majority shareholder enami ep may also participate in partnership or in association with other entities public or private see question 22 government expropriation of licences are there provisions in law dealing with government expropriation of licences what are the compensation provisions the constitution guarantees the right to private property and prohibits any kind of confiscation on an exceptional basis the constitution declares that the expropriation of property including mining concessions for reasons of public benefit or social interest may be declared at a fair value restitution and payment however there are no specific rules for valuation and compensation to determine how much a private individual could receive due to the expropriation of a mining concession protected areas are any areas designated as protected areas within your jurisdiction and which are off limits or specially regulated in ecuador there are various areas that are considered protected mainly for environmental conservation the referendum held in march 2017 amends the constitution and establishes that the extraction of non renewable resources including logging in protected and urban areas is prohibited under any circumstance in spite of the above it is important to clarify that within protected forests mining activities can be carried out once an environmental authorisation has been obtained the specific environmental authorisation will depend on the mining phase of the concession duties royalties and taxes duties royalties and taxes payable by private parties what duties royalties and taxes are payable by private parties carrying on mining activities are these revenue based or profit based the constitution provides that the state is entitled to receive a share of the benefits resulting from the exploitation of non renewable natural resources which is to be no less than that received by the concessionaire carrying out the exploitation the mining act more specifically establishes that the state s share consists of various duties taxes and royalties including annual patent fees income tax vat and a percentage of the concessionaire s profits and royalties depending of the category of the mining title further to the above points the guideline for granting mineral mining concessions establishes that in order to file a request for a new mining concession it is necessary to pay a fee equivalent to five times the current minimum wage per application this amount is not subject to reimbursement if the interested party is not awarded the mining concession after going through the tender process established in the mining act and the guideline if a party is awarded a mining concession it needs to pay a fee equivalent to twice the current minimum wage in order to register the minute award and the amount of one current minimum wage to register the mining title with arcom duties more specifically mining concessionaires have a number of financial obligations under the mining act including the requirement to pay annual conservation patent fees except in the artisanal mining category the conservation patent fees payable for concessions are calculated as follows for small scale mining a sum equivalent to 2 per cent of the current minimum wage multiplied by the number of hectares in the concession for medium scale mining a sum equivalent to 2 5 per cent of the current minimum wage multiplied by the number of hectares in the concession and regardless of the mining phase and for large scale mining initial exploration phase a sum equivalent to 2 5 per cent of the current minimum wage multiplied by the number of hectares in the concession advanced exploration phase a sum equivalent to 5 per cent of the current minimum wage multiplied by the number of hectares in the concession and exploitation phase a sum equivalent to 10 per cent of the current minimum wage multiplied by the number of hectares the minimum wage for 2019 is us 394 in addition mining concessionaires are required to pay additional fees for water usage these fees are set out in the water act and the authorisation for the use of water resolution granted by the national water secretariat the ministry of the environment also sets fees with regard to the environmental licence taxes mining concessionaires are also required to pay various taxes both direct and indirect direct taxes include income tax which is currently 25 per cent and payable on income less expenses in large scale mining the mining concessionaire must pay 3 per cent of their profits to their employees and 12 per cent of their profits to the state as part of the benefits share system whereas in medium scale mining is 5 per cent to the employees and 10 per cent to the state and in small scale mining is 10 per cent for employees and 5 per cent to the state finally if mining concessionaires send money abroad a 5 per cent currency exit tax is payable as for indirect taxes vat at a rate of 12 per cent is payable on goods purchased and services rendered the amendments introduced in december 2015 allow mineral exporters to recover vat as of january 2018 finally the same amendment permits all gold acquisitions by individuals or holders of mining concessions to also have a zero per cent vat rate as of 1 january 2018 customs duties and other charges imposed by customs are payable when importing goods into ecuador further with regard to municipal taxes liability for the following taxes should be borne in mind municipal patent the maximum annual tax that can be paid calculated according to a concessionaire s assets is us 5 000 municipal tax equivalent to 0 15 per cent of the concessionaire s assets and rural land tax concessionaires are also required to pay a contribution to the superintendency of companies which is currently set at 0 1 per cent of the concessionaire s real assets capital gains tax is also a variable on this section see question 23 royalties with regard to royalties the mining act states that during the exploitation stage mining concessionaires must pay a royalty depending on the mining category artisanal miners do not have to pay any royalty at all small scale mining is required to pay a royalty equivalent to 3 per cent of the sales of the principal and secondary minerals and medium scale and large scale mining is required to pay a royalty from 3 per cent to 8 per cent of the sales of the principal and secondary minerals the general mining regulations provide more detail stating that the royalty is calculated on the gross income less refining and transport costs on the other hand the percentage of royalties payable by concessionaires carrying out non metallic mining activities is calculated according to production costs tax advantages and incentives what tax advantages and incentives are available to private parties carrying on mining activities companies that reinvest their profits in the country are entitled to a 10 per cent reduction in the income tax payable on the amount reinvested in production assets provided the assets are to be used to purchase new machinery or equipment that are used as part of their production activities such as the purchase of goods related to investigations or technology to improve their productivity generate production diversity and to increase employment further deductions can be made when activities are carried out in economically depressed areas or frontier zones and citizens resident in such areas are employed tax stablisation does any legislation provide for tax stabilisation or are there tax stabilisation agreements in force the constitution guarantees the principle of legal certainty recognising clear ex ante legal rules that shall be respected by all the state authorities further after the promulgation of the organic code of production the state allows the possibility of signing investment protection agreements with both domestic and foreign investors in order to provide tax stability and other related incentives on 29 december 2014 the government enacted an amendment to the law which opens up the possibility to investors investing over us 100 million to negotiate and execute a legal and tax stability agreement thereby allowing investors to stabilise the regulations during the term of the agreement carried interest is the government entitled to a carried interest or a free carried interest in mining projects according to the constitution and the mining act the state may participate in mining projects through public or mixed public private companies in which the state should be the majority shareholder with the enactment of the mining act the national mining company enami ep was created in order to manage mining activity for the sustainable use of mining resources the company may carry out its duties independently or in partnership or association with other entities public or private in accordance with the legal provisions transfer taxes and capital gains are there any transfer taxes or capital gains imposed regarding the transfer of licences the organic production development law modified the capital gains tax law which previously stood at 22 per cent which now applies a scale ranging from zero per cent to 10 per cent on the earnings obtained from the transfer of shares of mining companies distinction between domestic parties and foreign parties is there any distinction between the duties royalties and taxes payable by domestic parties and those payable by foreign parties domestic and foreign parties are required to pay the same duties royalties and taxes see question 19 business structures principal business structures what are the principal business structures used by private parties carrying on mining activities while foreign companies can open a branch in ecuador this is rarely done because not only is there a risk that the foreign parent company may be held accountable for any of the branch s liabilities but also it is more expensive and takes longer to set up a branch than to incorporate a local company in addition local companies can have broader corporate objects whereas the corporate object of a branch must be exactly the same as that of the parent company as for joint ventures and trusts although these structures are permitted in accordance with ecuadorian legislation they are not often used as such the most common business structure is to incorporate an ecuadorian company numerous forms of company exist the most common being corporations and limited liability companies in many ways the forms of company are similar for example they must have at least two shareholders however the principal differences between the two are that in the case of limited liability companies the maximum number of shareholders is 15 and a shareholder may only transfer shares if the prior consent of all the other shareholders is obtained although it depends on the needs of each interested party because such restrictions do not apply to corporations this is the most common form of business structure used in the event of a joint venture this structure can be reflected in the share ownership of the local company local entity requirement is there a requirement that a local entity be a party to the transaction any foreign entity is required by law to be domiciled in ecuador in addition for tax planning reasons it is quite often advantageous to incorporate a local company bilateral investment and tax treaties are there jurisdictions with favourable bilateral investment treaties or tax treaties with your jurisdiction through which foreign entities will commonly structure their operations in your jurisdiction ecuador has entered into double taxation treaties with argentina belgium brazil canada chile china france germany italy mexico romania singapore south korea spain switzerland and uruguay it is therefore advisable for foreign entities to use these jurisdictions if possible if foreign entities wish to use jurisdictions that are considered to be tax havens it should be noted that ecuador imposes punitive taxes financing principal sources of financing what are the principal sources of financing available to private parties carrying on mining activities what role does the domestic public securities market play in financing the mining industry financing for mining operations generally comes from abroad as direct investment as there are limited local financial sources since financial entities such as banks consider mining activities to be high yield investments in addition there are no government financing sources for mining activities the mining industry therefore relies heavily on direct foreign investment either by entrepreneurs international investment banks private equity funds or trusts direct financing from government or major pension funds does the government its agencies or major pension funds provide direct financing to mining projects although government agencies and pension funds are permitted to provide direct financing to mining projects historically this has not occurred currently in ecuador financing for mining projects is entirely private and owing to the lack of experience in mining government agencies have no interest in providing funds for this type of project security regime please describe the regime for taking security over mining interests the personal nature of mining rights contradicts several norms of the mining act which treat the said rights as if they were property rights however because they are personal rights suitable guarantees can be set up for lenders to a mining project despite the possibility of pledging mining rights arising from a mining concession being open to question it is possible to establish an industrial pledge over a mining concessionaire s assets a mining concessionaire could therefore grant a number of distinct and independent security interests one over the mining rights arising out of the mining concession and the other over the buildings machinery tools etc located in the mining concession in accordance with the ecuadorian commercial code both the mining rights arising from a mining concession and the contractual rights stemming from the exploitation contract can be pledged as guarantee assignments to parties lending to a project pursuant to the civil code any right can be waived or assigned and thus property personal litigation and inheritance rights among others can be assigned the following conditions must be met to ensure that a guarantee assignment is an effective guarantee for parties lending to a mining project a financial entity not domiciled in the country or qualified as a subject entitled to mining rights must be allowed to be an assignee of mining rights and the authorisation for the guarantee assignment and any other requirement needed for the formalisation thereof should be in place at the time said assignment is granted so that if the mining concessionaire defaults the financial entity can automatically step into the project without needing further procedure or authorisation in addition to the above mentioned guarantees a pledge over the shares held by the holding company in the company operating the mining project would be another option the holding company could also place its shares in a guarantee trust in favour of the lenders to the project finally the guarantee system also allows for an industrial pledge on the minerals obtained from the deposit as well as on the current and future cash flows from the sale of said minerals restrictions importation restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the importation of machinery and equipment or services required in connection with exploration and extraction there are no restrictions regarding such importation but there are different alternatives for these procedures which will depend on the business structure and needs of a particular party standard conditions and agreements which standard conditions and agreements covering equipment supplies are used in your jurisdiction there are no specific standards used in ecuadorian jurisdiction to cover equipment supplies but the ecuadorian market is accommodating to suppliers and purchasers of industrial equipment used within the mining sector in terms of dispute resolutions usually the parties prefer to include international arbitration clauses in the equipment supply agreements rather than litigate in domestic courts mineral restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the processing export or sale of minerals are there any export quotas licensing or other mechanisms that prevent producers from freely exporting their production there are no restrictions regarding the processing export or sale of minerals obtained from mining operations the principle of free trade is enshrined in current legislation and minerals can be freely exported provided all of the relevant taxes have been paid see question 19 import of funds restrictions what restrictions are imposed on the import of funds for exploration and extraction or the use of the proceeds from the export or sale of minerals ecuador imposes no restrictions regarding the importation of funds to be used for mining operations nor on the use of proceeds resulting from the sale or exportation of minerals environment principal applicable environmental laws what are the principal environmental laws applicable to the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws the principal environmental laws applicable to the mining industry in ecuador are the constitution the environmental act the mining environmental regulations and the water act the regulation and control bodies are the ministry of the environment and its regional environmental offices and with regard to water resources the national secretariat of water environmental review and permitting process what is the environmental review and permitting process for a mining project how long does it normally take to obtain the necessary permits through amendments to the mining law introduced on 16 july 2013 the process for obtaining the environmental permits was simplified with the new regulations environmental permits can be summarised as follows for artisanal mining environmental fact sheets need to be approved for small scale mining environmental licences allow concessionaires to carry out exploration and exploitation activities simultaneously and for medium and large scale mining environmental fact sheets must be approved for the initial exploration stage which is a different and much simpler process than the environmental impact assessments required in the past an environmental declaration will need to be approved for the advanced exploration stage instead of the more complicated environmental impact assessment and an environmental licence will need to be approved for the exploitation on the basis of an environmental impact assessment when the concessionaires have completed all the requirements for the approval of the environmental licence this must be granted within six months of the presentation of the required documentation should the competent authority fail to respond within this time frame this shall be taken as tacit agreement to the commencement of mining activities in other words the law establishes positive administrative silence for the approval of environmental licences closure and remediation process what is the closure and remediation process for a mining project what performance bonds guarantees and other financial assurances are required all environmental impact studies must contain an environmental management plan which in turn must contain a plan for the partial or total closure of the mining operations among other details the plan must contain details regarding the dismantling of facilities remediation and rehabilitation of affected areas etc the concessionaire must provide an annual budget for these closure activities approved by the environmental authorities with regard to guarantees the concessionaire is required to provide a bank guarantee or take out an insurance policy which must remain in force until the total closure of mining operations in order to guarantee compliance with the environmental management plan restrictions on building tailings or waste dams what are the restrictions for building tailings or waste dams there are no restrictions for building tailings or waste dams nevertheless according to the mining act environmental act and environmental mining regulations it is necessary to have an environmental licence prior benefiting from tailing ponds and waste piles added to that the mining concessionaire must comply with the regulations and technical specifications contained in the mining act and environmental act see question 40 the company in charge of the operation and management of dam waste must demonstrate technical evidence and credentials to support its experience in this kind of infrastructure inspections of mining projects by local authorities are really common an alarm system is not mandatory but according to the legal framework it is advisable to prevent environmental disasters a common practice within private mining companies operating in ecuador in terms of responsibilities for a dam failure the immediate action is to prevent any human or infrastructure loss thus the government will use all their resources in that line there is a specific government entity that deals with any kind of natural disaster as a common practice companies must also provide all the necessary support to the above mentioned end health safety and labour issues principal health and safety and labour laws what are the principal health and safety and labour laws applicable to the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws the principal legal provisions regarding health and safety as well as labour laws are set out in international agreements to which ecuador is a party including the international labour organization the constitution and various ecuadorian laws and regulations including the labour code and the general labour risks insurance regulations among others labour law in ecuador is complex the rights granted to employees by legislation cannot be waived or challenged the labour code regulates the forms of labour contracts holidays minimum wages bonuses and other benefits maternity leave unions and collective contracts strikes and compensation among other matters the social security act governs social security benefits and all companies must affiliate their employees to the ecuadorian social security institute iess the iess and the ministry of labour together with its labour inspectors are responsible for ensuring compliance with labour and social security legislation management and recycling of mining waste what are the rules related to management and recycling of mining waste products who has title and the right to explore and exploit mining waste products in tailings ponds and waste piles according to the mining act mining waste products in tailing ponds and waste piles are part of the mining concession therefore the mining concessionaire has the right to freely exploit and benefit from them however according to the mining act and the environmental act it is necessary to acquire an environmental licence prior to exploiting and benefiting from mining waste products in tailing ponds and waste piles the mining concessionaire must follow the regulations contained in the mining act and environmental act use of domestic and foreign employees what restrictions and limitations are imposed on the use of domestic and foreign employees in connection with mining activities the mining act states that no more than 20 per cent of a mining company s employees can be foreign further preference should always be given to ecuadorian specialised technical personnel and only if there are none should foreign personnel be contracted any foreign employees must have a work visa and comply with all applicable labour and immigration requirements including the obligation to train ecuadorian personnel in their field of expertise in addition when hiring mining companies must favour workers living in the project s area and have policies regarding the integration of employees families in place social and community issues community engagement and csr what are the principal community engagement or csr laws applicable to the mining industry what are the principal regulatory bodies that administer those laws all mining activities must respect the principle of sumak kawsay an indigenous principle enshrined in the constitution in order to ensure that everyone live in a healthy and economically sustainable environment therefore ecuadorian legislation contains many provisions regarding these matters there are a series of legal provisions regarding csr in various pieces of legislation including the constitution the mining act the environmental act and the citizen participation act among others additionally international human rights agreements such as the international labour organization ilo convention 169 on indigenous and tribal people in independent countries the united nations un global compact and other un guidelines are applied within mining operations in ecuador rights of aboriginal indigenous or disadvantaged peoples how do the rights of aboriginal indigenous or currently or previously disadvantaged peoples affect the acquisition or exercise of mining rights in ecuador the collective rights of indigenous communities nationalities and peoples are recognised in the constitution and the various international human rights agreements protocols declarations and other principles see question 42 indigenous communities nationalities and peoples must be consulted freely and with sufficient information regarding any plans or programmes to explore exploit or sell non renewable natural resources located within their land and which could affect them either environmentally or culturally or affect their property rights further they have the right to receive a share of the benefits generated by these projects and to receive compensation for any social cultural or environmental damage caused as a result the consultation referred to above is mandatory and must be carried out by the competent authorities on a timely basis it is important to point out that according to international standards and conventions the result of the consultation process is not legally binding it is prohibited to carry out extractive activities in lands belonging to aboriginal people who voluntarily choose to remain isolated international law what international treaties conventions or protocols relating to csr issues are applicable in your jurisdiction ecuador is party to a number of international treaties the principal ones being the universal declaration of human rights the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination the un covenant on civil and political rights the international covenant on economic social and cultural rights the additional protocol to the american convention on human rights in the area of economic social and cultural rights the ilo convention 169 and the un declaration on the rights of indigenous people according to the current constitution these international agreements are binding and within them the provisions of the human rights agreements prevail over the constitution itself in addition the government has developed laws and regulations to protect the right to prior consultation of indigenous communities notably in light of a 2012 decision of the inter american court of human rights ecuador should adopt legislative measures in order to fully facilitate the right of indigenous peoples to prior consultation and should also modify those laws that may restrict its free and informed exercise anti bribery and corrupt practices local legislation describe any local legislation governing anti bribery and corrupt practices with regard to the ecuadorian legislation on anti bribery and corrupt practices it is important to consider the principles enshrined in the constitution as well as in the criminal code the organic law on transparency and social control and the organic law on transparency and access to public information the constitution along with the aforementioned legislation develops a strict legal framework to regulate control and sanction anti bribery and corrupt practices foreign legislation do companies in your country pay particular attention to any foreign legislation governing anti bribery and foreign corrupt practices in your jurisdiction considering that there is a strict legal framework regarding anti bribery and corrupt practices in ecuador companies have strict rules on compliance and disclosure to this regard the constitution ratifies that all international instruments and treaties endorsed by ecuador are part of the domestic legal system commonly companies follow the regulations contained in the inter american conventions against corruption and the un convention against corruption among others for instance us and canadian companies include in their contracts the reference of the foreign corrupt practices act and convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions of the organisation for economic co operation and development disclosure of payments by resource companies has your jurisdiction enacted legislation or adopted international best practices regarding disclosure of payments by resource companies to government entities in accordance with the extractive industries transparency initiative eiti standard in 2009 the inter american development bank and the faro group signed an agreement to develop the transparency in the extractive industry in ecuador project focused on achieving the active participation of public and private companies linked to extractive industries particularly in the oil sector see idbdocs iadb org wsdocs getdocument aspx docnum 35400790 the initiative s main objective is the application of the minimum level of the agreed upon standards which allow for the transparent handling of information within the sector additionally the ecuadorian government joined the extractive industries transparency initiative that seeks good governance and public disclosure of information within oil gas and mining industries in accordance with both initiatives the constitution allows for the general public to participate throughout different levels of government decision making processes the right to transparent information is recognised within the constitution as per local legislation the organic law on transparency and access to public information enables members of the public to access publicly available information that is closely related to the aforementioned initiatives foreign investment foreign ownership restrictions are there any foreign ownership restrictions in your jurisdiction relevant to the mining industry the constitution incorporated the prohibition of land surface rights acquisition by foreign nationals in border areas which extends to 20km from the border this prohibition does not apply to mining concessions however if an area is located within the border area it is necessary to obtain a prior authorisation from the ministry of defence in accordance with article 41 of the homeland security law international treaties applicable international treaties what international treaties apply to the mining industry or an investment in the mining industry ecuador has double taxation treaties with argentina belgium brazil canada chile china france germany italy mexico romania singapore south korea spain switzerland and uruguay the national assembly approved the revocation of 12 foreign investment protection treaties including the canada ecuador fipa canada ecuador fipa the canada ecuador fipa expressly provides for the right of a party to terminate the treaty by giving one year s advance notice once termination becomes effective that is one year after the termination notice is delivered the effective termination date all of the articles of the treaty except for article xviii which sets out the termination provision remain in full force and effect for a period of 15 years for investments or commitments to invest made prior to the effective termination date investments or commitments to invest made after the effective termination date will not be eligible for fipa protection and will have to rely on domestic legislation for protection ecuadorian legislation provides for investment agreements a form of protection discussed at the end of this question the termination provisions can be found in article xviii 2 of the canada ecuador fipa as follows this agreement shall remain in force unless either contracting party notifies the other contracting part in writing of its intention to terminate it the termination of this agreement shall become effective one year after notice of termination has been received by the other contracting party in respect of investments or commitments to invest made prior to the date when the termination of this agreement becomes effective the provisions of articles i to xvii inclusive of this agreement shall remain in force for a period of fifteen years based on the express wording found in the canada ecuador fipa the interpretation rules found in the vienna convention on law of treaties and relevant international law authorities and jurisprudence article xviii 2 of the canada ecuador fipa will allow the investor the right to assert claims under the treaty for a period of 15 years following the termination of the treaty so long as these claims arise out of investments or commitments to invest made prior to the date on which the termination of the treaty becomes effective the effective termination date furthermore in our view the unconditional consent provided by ecuador to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this article xiii of the canada ecuador fipa will permit a canadian investor who has made investments or commitments to invest within the requisite period the right to invoke the arbitration mechanism for a period of 15 years following the termination of the treaty notwithstanding any statement or notice by ecuador withdrawing such consent in other words the investor s submission of a dispute to arbitration including the concurrent consent for arbitration required from the investor need not be provided in advance of the effective termination of the canada ecuador fipa or prior to the date of the giving of notice by ecuador to the government of canada seeking to terminate the treaty in order to exercise its right to seek arbitration the investor would be able to initiate the proceeding pursuant to article xiii at any time within the 15 year survival period provided it meets the requirements for submitting the dispute to arbitration and providing its consent update and trends recent developments what were the biggest mining news events over the past year in your jurisdiction and what were the implications what are the current trends and developments in 2019 in your jurisdiction s mining industry legislation major cases significant transactions the elimination of the windfall profit tax in 2018 has been positive for ecuador s mining industry being replaced by the organic production development law of august 2018 that eliminated the burden that levied 70 per cent tax on the difference between the sale price of the metal extracted and the base price set in the mining exploitation contract the same law has also modified capital gains tax which was previously set at 22 per cent by applying a new scale that ranges from zero per cent to 10 per cent on the earnings obtained from the transfer of shares of mining companies it also lowered the range of royalties for industrial mining which now runs from 3 per cent to 8 per cent of net smelter return although the tax amendments were great for the mining community ecuador is still facing critical challenges within the industry in our opinion the following two challenges are the most significant judicial and political activism against mining 2018 witnessed an aggressive campaign against the mining industry from political groups that self identify as ecologists additionally activists took mining matters to the courts under a guide that the duty to provide free prior and informed consultation to indigenous peoples was breached they filed constitutional protection actions causing strategic mining projects to be suspended such as the río blanco run by junefield similarly on 18 march 2019 the ecuadorian constitutional court announced that the public referendum on mining in a district where inv metals intends to place facilities could proceed the court s ruling was strictly procedural holding that because it had not pronounced itself in a timely fashion on the substance of the matter specifically whether the process of the vote was constitutional the decision of a national election council approving the vote must stand the referendum vote took place on 24 march 2019 in azuay province long known to be sensitive about water usage and in a highly charged political environment where misinformation and fear abounded unsurprisingly the local referendum result went against the mining activity inv metals responded by announcing they were evaluating the results and may possibly relocate their facilities to a more sympathetic district several parties announced their intention to challenge the outcome of the vote on the grounds that it was unconstitutional illegal mining the second challenge causing upheaval in the mining industry is the growth of illegal mining sadly those seeking a mine free territory and fighting against large companies are in reality fighting a false battle one that leaves huge gains for illegal mining organised criminal gangs have teams of labour kept in slave like conditions at their disposal who are exploited and are not equipped with modern equipment such gangs work with no regard for environmental protection have no employment or health cover and pay no taxes while performing work in risky and unsafe conditions despite such challenges facing the industry we are optimistic about 2019 the government s mining and economic authorities have a clear vision of the importance of the industry for the economy which is ever more so now following the drop in world oil prices recent decisions by the ministry of energy and non renewable natural resources to allow scout drilling activities during the initial exploration phase and the emphatic intervention of environmental authorities to facilitate the processes to obtain licences and permits for mining activities confirm the government s support for the mining industry foreign companies continue to be interested in expanding within ecuador as demonstrated by codelco on 29 march 2019 which formalised the creation of a joint venture corporation with enami for the co development of the large llurimagua copper porphyry deposit likewise other major mining companies such as anglo american bhp first quantum and newcrest all continue to invest directly and indirectly in exploration and development across the country at the same time two major mines fruta del norte lundin gold and mirador ecuacorriente remain on course to enter into production in 2020 real progress in the mining industry requires competition and undertakings by companies the state has duties that it must comply with to ensure adherence to the rule of law but

tuesday in boston but his public appearance on wednesday is of higher importance powell will testify before the house financial services committee and will have the opportunity to respond to the jobs report and other economic developments it will be interesting to see if he reiterates concerns related to trade or if he is content with the trade truce investors will scrutinize every word trying to understand if the fed intends to cut interest rates only once as an insurance policy or embark on an easing cycle as markets project officials have recently attempted to moderate market expectations

by to understand how the two tiered system in higher education reproduces itself i think it is useful to analyze how those in positions of relative power often serve to legitimate the system rhetorically culturally and via political discussion this is especially true when the purported aim of those driving the discussion is a progressive one as i hope to show below with analyses of a tenure track professor s commentary on healthcare disparities in academia and of the higher education plans recently put forward by high profile politicians seeking the democratic presidential nomination in addition i spell out below the kind of educational aims and strategy those of us most severely impacted by the two tiered system need to adopt if we are to abolish the disparate treatment incisively described as faculty apartheid the two tiered system refers to the class structure in academia that bestows a modicum of prestige and influence upon a dwindling portion of the professoriate while ensuring the privileges that shrinking strata of faculty enjoy are made possible by the disempowering of the rest of us who teach at community colleges state universities and sometimes even ivy league institutions the two tiered system reflects the separation of faculty into haves and have nots the system is responsible for the conditions facing contingent faculty and adjuncts designations used more or less interchangeably to refer to us have nots although adjunct tends to imply part time per semester contract status while contingent is more of a catch all for professorial precarity the two tiered system is responsible for the new faculty majority of precariously employed professors who rarely know if they will have jobs from one semester to the next it produces and indicates the existence of déclassé faculty who despite holding master s degrees and often enough phds are paid appreciably less than their counterparts on the tenure track subsist in poverty or near poverty and frequently lack basic job benefits unlike our tenure track and tenured colleagues we adjuncts are subject to the whims of department chairs and upper level administration we might not get offered classes the next term if lecturer money dries up or if we annoy our chairs fellow faculty with the power to hire or to deny us work we are part of the gig economy the two tiered system created and continually reproduces a situation in which a significant number of faculty are routine freeway fliers reduced to cobbling together several part time gigs at a couple different schools in order to teach enough classes and earn just enough to squeak by for a while maybe oh and sometimes especially during summers we work plenty of other jobs too selective assessments of the health impacts of higher education the death of an underpaid 83 year old adjunct margaret mary vojtko made headlines a few years back thea hunter a consummate scholar whose career and life opportunities were fatally limited by the two tiered system died last december she had a number of ailments that bothered her her asthma her heart and the rigors of being an adjunct added to them wrote adam harris in his posthumous profile of hunter a tenacious historian whose body just could not keep up the fight forever had she been tenured she would have experienced a sort of security that tenure is designed to provide a campus office of her own health insurance authority and respect with which to navigate campus bureaucracy greater financial stability without tenure she was unprotected at the whim of her body s failings working long hours for little pay teaching large survey classes outside of her area of special expertise the two tiered system perseveres precisely because the human cost of higher education gets placed out of sight out of mind colleges of course are not eager to broadcast to the world that despite the always increasing tuition dollars pouring in instructors without benefits offices or job security often teach the majority of classes the academic underclass is no fun for tenured and tenure line professors to think about either especially as they enjoy a comfortable living and decent working conditions while those performing similar or the exact same labor flounder even when authors benefitting from the two tiered system acknowledge the conditions of contingency they seldom prioritize the problem the better off portion of the professoriate makes the obligatory gesture lamenting the shameful situation their co workers face seemingly just so they can feign empathy and tout their progressive chops it also enables them to avoid looking like the proverbial ostriches with their heads buried in the sand but when they do acknowledge the plight of adjunct professors they swiftly de emphasize that struggle soon after the framing and focus shift elision of the two tiered system ensures it receives implicit legitimation a june 2019 piece by andrea chow a tenure track job means finally catching up on doctor visits published at the chronicle illustrates the rhetorical maneuver the author detailed how low pay and lack of decent health insurance kept her from getting much needed medical and dental treatment throughout graduate school the issue was finally remedied chow explains when she landed a tenure track job and the money and health coverage that comes with it her criticism of the conditions faced and hardships endured by graduate student workers is spot on and should sound familiar to many contingent faculty who had to earn master s and doctoral degrees to obtain their precarious positions the fact that so many graduate students who pursue their own scholarship while working as low paid teaching and research assistants will go on to enter a job market that all but assures they will constantly chase and likely never land the ever elusive tenure track spot while spinning their wheels as adjuncts is why chow s framing is such a problem adjuncts and other contingent faculty members often are forced to let chronic health issues go unresolved for even longer since they spend years in temporary jobs with limited to no health insurance and are unable to find tenure track employment she states several paragraphs into the article yet she concludes by emphasizing that if higher education is to be a viable pathway for anyone other than the independently wealthy then comprehensive and contractually secured health insurance including dental and vision coverage ought to be treated as a basic right for graduate employees graduate school shouldn t be a health risk she proclaimed toward the end of her piece chow is right but her omission reinforces an awful wrong there are chronic health issues plaguing a whole class of professors who subsist without adequate health insurance and with little income to treat underlying ailments this issue which is acknowledged by the author earlier in the article is forgotten within a few paragraphs her refrain from highlighting healthcare as a right for adjuncts too reflects the disregard for non tenure track faculty inherent in the two tiered system the framing helps legitimate that system political rhetoric shaping the understanding of injustice in higher education omissions akin to the aforementioned are on display in the mainstream political discourse already receiving added attention in anticipation of the 2020 presidential election not so long ago former vice president and current presidential hopeful joe biden apparently unfamiliar or unconcerned with the realities of those of us off the tenure track blamed college tuition increases on the salaries of professors while the political climate has changed consent for the two tiered system remains intact deafening silence and the art of overlooking crisis function to solicit that consent even the most progressive of today s democratic presidential candidates including those who otherwise champion issues related to education are more or less mum when it comes to the issues facing contingent faculty senator elizabeth warren recently put forward a plan to cancel up to 50 000 in student loan debt for everyone with a household income under 100 000 her plan would provide substantial debt cancellation for every person with household income between 100 000 and 250 000 as well her proposal includes a provision for universal free college too which she suggests would grant every american the opportunity to attend a two year or four year public college without paying a dime in tuition or fees among adjuncts there are those who dismiss plans for fully publicly funded higher education they question where the money will come from for her part warren proposes to fit the bill for the broad debt cancellation and universal free college with an ultra millionaire tax which would amount to an annual two percent tax on families with 50 million or more in wealth what the presidential candidate s self proclaimed truly transformational proposal fails to address however is the super exploited labor of those who teach at colleges and universities in the us in her post warren included links to stories from eight educators whose lives have been adversely affected by student loan debt tellingly no adjunct professors were invited to detail their experiences yet we have no shortage of horror stories to share for example ellen tara james penny an adjunct professor at san jose state who sleeps in her car because she cannot afford rent said she is 143 000 in debt because of the student loans she took out when she went back to school after losing her tech job during the dotcom crash and i m in my 50s she told the camera but i pay that loan every month while warren s post contains a promising subhead addressing inequities in our higher education system and a corresponding section that importantly explains how her plan will address racial disparities and work to improve enrollment and graduation rates for low income students ideas on how to transform the two tiered system are entirely absent the self evident adage that faculty working conditions are also student learning conditions evidently did not factor into her diagnosis of what ails higher education in the us and it did not prompt her campaign team to address one of the most fundamental inequities characterizing it today failure to even mention contingency helps guarantee the two tiered system continues to be academia s dirtiest and tacitly condoned secret senator bernie sanders another presidential contender and progressive champion on the education front put forward a proposal earlier this year in which his team stressed that if you cannot pursue your dream of becoming a teacher environmentalist journalist or nurse because you cannot make enough money to cover your monthly student loan payments then you are not truly free in response to those who would dismiss the imperative of free higher education his team added that you are not truly free when the vast majority of good paying jobs require a degree that requires taking out tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt to obtain like the warren campaign the sanders camp also explained where the money would come from which should allay the concerns of those alleging a failure on the part of ambitious politicians to specify how they plan to pay for the abolition of tuition fees and unpaid student loan debts the sanders campaign estimated the cost of making higher education a right coupled with complete student debt cancellation at 2 2 trillion to cover the cost they propose a wall street speculation tax placing a tax of 50 cents on every 100 of stock trades plus 1 percent bond trades and a 005 percent derivative trades fees capable of generating they estimate 2 4 trillion over 10 years his team noted that beyond the elimination of tuition and fees the sanders plan will match any additional spending from states and tribes which reduces the cost of attending school at a dollar for dollar rate and that the funds could be used to hire additional faculty ensure professors get professional development opportunities and increase students access to educational opportunities aside from that tangential reference though the post contains no mention of the other major crisis afflicting higher education the two tiered system retains staying power and the 1 3 million professors excluded from the tenure track suffer because of the rhetorical and political neglect in late june sanders along with representatives parmila javapal and ilhan omar introduced formal legislation to eliminate tuition and fees and to cancel student debt their college for all act creates a federal state partnership and grant program to eliminate tuition and fees at public institutions of higher learning and at tribal colleges and universities and it mandates student loan forgiveness closer inspection of the text reveals the architects of the legislation gave some thought albeit maybe only some afterthought to faculty working conditions one section stipulates that within five years after an eligible institution receives a grant to go toward tuition and fee elimination at least 75 percent of instruction there should be performed by tenured or tenure track professors of course it says nothing about how to create a path toward tenure for those not on the tenure line the congresspersons who crafted the legislation might have invoked a model like the one used by the vancouver community college system which enables regularization and some job protection for many instructors who would feel the wrath of contingency were they teaching at most any other school in the us yet they did not the college for all act does state that once tuition and fees are eliminated schools receiving grants should use the remaining funds to reduce the cost of attendance and increase the quality of instruction and student support services and a few of the suggested ways to accomplish that are noteworthy increasing the number and percentage of full time instructional faculty including full time tenure and tenure track instructional faculty is one method listed another involves equipping all faculty with professional supports to help students succeed such as professional development opportunities office space and shared governance in the institution several workplace rights currently denied quite a few contingent faculty the final suggested use of surplus funds is the only explicit mention of the academic underclass and it calls on institutions to remunerate adjunct and part time faculty for work done inside and outside of the classroom relating to instruction such as holding office hours if schools used their excess funds in that manner it would no doubt improve the working conditions for instructors hitherto treated as disposable however none of this even begins to dismantle the two tiered system and if there are no remaining funds for institutions to work with then even these inadequate half measures will remain empty promises what have we learned in may 2019 the sanders team announced a thurgood marshall plan for public education which focuses on k 12 schooling but contains insights germane to a discussion of the hegemony of academia s two tiered system his team recounted how in the last year we saw thousands upon thousands of teachers go on strike the wave of teacher strikes throughout the country provides an historic opportunity to make the investments we desperately need to make our public education system the best in the industrialized world not one of the poorest they wrote arguably the democratization and revitalization of the chicago teachers union and the 26 000 member strong strike back in september 2012 catalyzed an educator driven counter hegemonic movement that has only just recently reclaimed the spotlight that strike executed in my home state of illinois changed the public narrative and showed the strength of social movement unionism rooted in community a strike wave in traditionally red states like oklahoma kentucky and west virginia captivated the radical pedagogical imagination in 2018 in southern california not too far a drive from the inland empire where i currently live and teach some 34 000 educators in los angeles went on strike and won in early 2019 thereby teaching us another lesson in what organizing and movement building can accomplish teachers in oakland reiterated the message neither the all too often milquetoast nor the self styled nor even the meaningfully progressive elements of the relatively empowered professoriate nor the most progressive of presidential candidates can be counted on to contest the dominance and legitimacy of the two tiered system to do that precarious faculty have to organize and adopt the sort of militancy our fellow k 12 educators have demonstrated to be both effective and transformative solidarity is essential for any serious successful effort to abolish the two tiered system the narrowly focused adjuncts among us who flippantly criticize budding movements toward a tuition and fees free higher education and toward student debt forgiveness ironically echo the dearth of concern the two tiered system and those benefiting from it tend to show contingent faculty to be sure debt cancellation and free higher education are in the interest of a plethora of the already existing academic precariat and should be part of any abolitionist politics worthy of the name i personally have a total unpaid federal student loan balance of 3 855 41 last i checked my monthly repayment is just one more bill i can barely afford as an adjunct and i am not alone or a loan as the pun would have it folks i went to grad school with many destined to enter the contingent faculty fray owed more than 100 000 in student loans debt forgiveness and free college are in the interest of future contingent faculty busy accumulating massive debt to pay for the undergraduate and graduate education necessary to do this line of work few present and future contingent faculty are going to be excited about organizing with fellow adjuncts who fail to give a shit about their financial situations even though that predicament is inseparable from their struggle as part of the low paid precariously employed professoriate what is more adjunct self organization alone will not suffice like k 12 educators have shown solidarity with students and the surrounding community are key components of successful organizing politicians and well off faculty will stop reproducing consent for the two tiered system only when students and graduates ally with their current and former professors fighting to survive off the tenure track we would be presumptuous indifferent and foolhardy to think students and those in the community saddled with debt post graduation should or will fight alongside us if we refuse to understand their struggle as our own if we reject that shared struggle we teach the sort of insidious lessons that undermine education as a common good and engender the worldviews that make possible the popular acceptance of a pernicious structure of faculty stratification one of the myths that serves to justify the two tiered system suggests we adjuncts deserve our lot because we are subpar pedagogues who just do not care or try hard enough the best way to dispel that is to evince the kind of education we believe in
many people liken the trade war between the united states and china to the situation triggered by the great depression when the world s major economies competed with one another to raise import tariffs and threw the global economy into severe turmoil they are wrong when an importing country hikes its tariffs businesses in the exporter country incur losses either when they are unable to pass the cost of higher tariffs sufficiently on to the consumers or when they see the volume of their sales decline due to higher prices but unlike the days when the whole process from production of parts to the manufacturing of finished products was completed within national borders today parts made in a certain country are typically shipped to another to be assembled and traded from there for example china imports parts and components from japan taiwan thailand and so on to build the finished products that it ships to the u s if the product is priced at 10 000 and the aggregate value of the imported parts amounts to 9 000 the damage incurred by china will only be its added value of 1 000

london icis although not yet a fully fledged shakespearean tragedy discussions between iran and its opec partners were certainly at daggers drawn at the last opec meeting in vienna on 2 july with us sanctions in full flight and other opec producers feasting on tehran s predicament the country managed to support the production agreement while publicly letting know that it would veto the cartel s attempt to formalise supply coordination with russia the global market has been tracking the wider opec group s effort which includes russia to realign oecd crude inventories with their 5 year average to boost prices however 40 of those are us inventories and while president trump has consistently blamed the cartel for jacking up prices washington has strategically stayed out of any supply agreement in the second quarter of 2019 us crude stocks have increased by 36m barrels including 20m barrels from the us gulf alone and 6m from cushing oklahoma the main pricing point for wti this represents a 12 year on year increase and a level that currently stands at 2 5 7 6m bbl at 54 4m bbl above its five year average meanwhile us production currently stands at about 12 3m bbl day feeding directly into the 2 15m bbl day of non opec crude supply increase in 2018 as clouds are gathering on the macroeconomic front the risk has now clearly shifted to the demand side worldwide trade tensions are slowly building up on a growing set of protectionist measures from the us including a barely disguised containment policy on china unless both countries succeed in finding an acceptable short term compromise the effect of such policies will be oil demand destruction that any supply moderation from opec will be unlikely to offset the risk of a cold war between the us and china could be extremely damaging not only to crude oil prices but to the wider global economy the us and european central banks are now pondering to what extent they should remain accommodative into the second half of 2019 and into 2020 at the moment a return to full scale quantitative easing seems unlikely as both banks are standing by their yield curves ready to put the brakes on on the other hand and given the current capital strike across the oil sector an interest rate hike would surely increase the risk of diminished cash flows for companies and hence further delay any capital expenditure this would only add to the plague of erratic oil prices and hence difficult hedging on the positive side and despite the us treasury yield curve inversion usually a bearish sign none of the markers that typically precede a recession are currently sticking out at levels that may cause alarm bond yields remain low everywhere the corporate bond spreads hover at their historical average even if they started to creep up in 2018 the oil price remains below its 10 year average and the us dollar although higher has not overshot source fred in us dollars constant maturity percentage daily not seasonally adjusted the macroeconomic concern for oil going forward may be on a possible widening of credit spreads and financial conditions for example us independent oil and gas companies have long relied on high yield debt issuance to drill for shale oil a lot of them are now complaining that cash is drying up and that credit availability has narrowed which could signal the early stages of a credit crunch source fred in us dollars this is a real problem for an oil sector that has consistently failed to invest in the renewal of oil reserves since the late 2014 price collapse energy companies are no longer investing in long life offshore development projects and exxon recently announced its complete pull out of the north sea instead companies invest in shale where the decline curve is about 70 80 in year one implying that continuous drilling is necessary to maintain production it is an expensive business that requires economies of scale hence the recent wave of consolidation in the sector and the renewed interest of oil majors at the moment the global oil market looks very resilient with a rather large supply overhang us deputy energy secretary dan brouillette said that us production could run to the tune of 13m bbl day by 2020 adding that the global crude market as it stands now can replace the oil it would loose from any potential production disruption this sounds unlikely even at a lower rate global oil demand continues to grow at 1 15 1 3m bbl day emerging countries among them india and china are still ravenous for oil given the capital constraints on shale oil and no matter how prolific us production is it is unlikely to keep up with demand pressure regardless of a slowing world economy with only 2m bbl day of spare capacity from saudi arabia some of which is already used to offset the us sanctions against iran any supply shocks remain a tangible risk to the global crude complex and by extension to oil prices source ice by julien mathonniere

analysis if you were to search president emmerson mnangagwa and finance minister mthuli ncube as well as their colleagues and advisers among others in officialdom you will almost certainly find wads of dollars greenbacks not bond notes or some other dubious local quasi currency in their pockets while government in a surprise move this week abolished the multi currency system which saved the country from the inferno of hyperinflation and chaos from 2009 the use of the united states dollar as a unit of account medium of exchange and store of value in zimbabwe is unlikely to end it might have been removed as legal tender but it will remain the preferred currency

by reuters by vuyani ndaba johannesburg reuters most emerging market currencies have probably seen the best of a lukewarm year against the dollar as u s president donald trump is expected to back pedal on his conciliatory tone from the recent g20 summit a reuters poll showed on friday emerging market currencies have had a relatively resilient year despite a long list of risks such as elections in south africa and fractured relations between the united states with trading partners from china to turkey the poll taken in the past week suggested emerging market currencies will lose the gains held since the year began south africa s rand is expected to lose almost 4 to 14 50 russia s rouble about 2 5 to 65 00 and india s rupee about 2 to 70 00 these currencies staged a mild recovery after the group of 20 summit in japan where trump offered some concessions in the trade spat with china but analysts are not convinced that will last we think that the recovery will come to an end as trump inevitably relapses into protectionist talk and downside risks to chinese and u s growth materialise said francesca beausang senior economist at continuum economics the current recovery for emerging market currencies is driven by a resurgence of risk on sentiment given the more conciliatory tone struck by u s president trump at the g20 especially vis à vis china added beausang representatives from the united states and china are organising a resumption of talks for next week to try to resolve the year long trade war between the world s two largest economies trump administration officials said on wednesday limits to gains the federal reserve has signalled interest rate cuts could come soon partly due to uncertainty caused by the trade war and several emerging markets central banks have either embarked on easing or are on the road to do so still interest rates in some of these economies will still be high enough to attract capital inflows in south africa on thursday the rand broke through the psychological 14 level its strongest in two and a half months annabel bishop chief economist at investec noted that while the rand is likely to continue to gain from perceptions and occurrence of global monetary easing third quarter trading always tends to show risk off sentiment in particular fears of slowing global economic growth have impacted markets and could limit emerging market currencies gain in the third quarter she said domestic politics could also become a bigger risk factor as the second half of 2019 progresses especially in latin america brazil s controversial pension reform plan goes to crunch time this month while argentina moves towards october s general election in an increasingly bitter campaign over economic matters such as the future of its stand by credit line with the international monetary fund last month a similar survey suggested investors will be more cautious and selective in making risky bets against a strong dollar in coming months as fears over the united states aggressive trade policy rattles markets advertisement polling by indradip ghosh khushboo mittal and anisha sheth additional polling and reporting by vivek mishra in bengaluru and gabriel burin in buenos aires editing by jonathan cable and andrew cawthorne

recently carbon tracker s power and utilities team travelled to vietnam to market our latest analyst note here comes the sun and wind during this trip we met with government officials local experts and renewables originators in this blog post we summarise what we learnt and what s next for our work in the region we re not in kansas anymore researching southeast asia is as intimidating as it is exciting the southeast asian region is a geographically expansive and populous region characterised by social and cultural variation being predominantly european power analysts analysing the vietnamese power market is a daunting task due to the lack of transparency around data and vastly different market structures moreover in stark contrast to europe vietnam s rapid economic growth demographic profile and manufacturing base means power demand will grow at 5 10 for the foreseeable future as the nation prioritises building out its capital stock without help from our local partner green innovation and development centre greenid we would have been fish out of water renewables have the potential to become the least cost option for vietnam to meet its energy needs we would take a price 35 below the current tariff if the government amended the ppa panel participant global wind energy council vietnam wind conference amongst all the noise about the implications of the paris agreement vietnamese policymakers have two core priorities provide cheap energy and use this energy to build out the nation s capital stock any policy that gets in the way of these priorities will likely be marginalised or rejected the challenge for policymakers is how to provide least cost electricity while also keeping debt within the ceiling of 65 of gdp and managing socio economic priorities such as strengthening commodity price security how policymakers meet this challenge will have far reaching implications for the nation s economic growth public debt and energy security after the roadshow we are more optimistic on the potential of renewable energy there is no shortage of interest from industry for instance with over 400 participants the global wind energy council gwec vietnam wind conference showed that there is huge interest in growing vietnam s renewable market to become a regional leader during a panel discussion at the gwec conference one panel participant stated they would take a price 35 below the current tariff if the government amended the power purchase agreement ppa presuming this statement is true the cost of onshore wind has the potential to be around 55 mwh or over 10 below the cost of new coal today based on a levelised cost of energy analysis from bloomberg nef policy reform is vital to realising the low cost renewable revolution many interpret policy reform as code for the need to subsidise renewable energy the reality could not be further from the truth vietnam s high feed in tariffs for wind and solar are the result of significant investment uncertainty the ppa for wind and solar is high risk relative to the ppa for coal and gas meaning capital raising is currently skewed in favour of thermal capacity the table below highlights the major differences between ppas for renewable and thermal capacity risk wind and solar ppa coal and gas ppa curtailment risk evn can curtail without compensation i e take or leave contract evn subjected to restrictions on curtailment i e take or pay contract government guarantee no guarantee in the event of evn default previously the government has guaranteed part of the project risk fixed tariff potential interest rate exposure historically negotiated with evn transmission and interconnection risk seller liable for transmission and interconnection risk historically negotiated with evn source carbon tracker analysis note mckinsey company baker mckenzie and the world bank offer a more thorough review of investment risks vietnam should transition from feed in tariffs to reverse auctions however while reverse auctions can encourage least cost deployment without wider policy reform they will unlikely stimulate developer and investor demand successful reverse auctions are characterised by a high rate of failure this is a challenging problem for policymakers as the power development plan pdp stipulates the amount of capacity and who will build it for instance for grid connected solar pv projects developers can only finance projects that have been included in the relevant pdp more data transparency more low cost capital energy infrastructure is not the only reason why regional and international investors are interested in vietnam most notably vietnam stands to benefit from the so called tariff war between the us and china as capital surges towards vietnam s low cost manufacturing base policymakers can leverage this interest to get the best possible financing terms for energy while this is a smart negotiating tactic policymakers also need to focus on greater data transparency transparency is essential for the creation of efficient liquid and competitive power markets it is also critical for creating a level playing field between participants and avoiding the scope for market power to be abused this is a particularly sensitive issue for renewables originators in vietnam as i evn is a vertically integrated utility meaning it often has little incentive to be more transparent and ii power demand is increasing rapidly and therefore the reliability of grid infrastructure could be changing as a consequence many factors both internal and external influence the working cost of capital wacc of renewable energy projects including country risk however greater data transparency would allow policymakers to identify and regulate market abuses and in doing so create a more level playing field for renewables the table below contrasts data transparency in vietnam with europe which has a mature and competitive renewables market data type europe vietnam plant generation half hourly publicly available data at unit level yearly publicly available data at plant level plant revenues wholesale power price data publicly available in real time capacity market revenues made publicly available and balancing market data made publicly available ppa date publicly unavailable revenues partially available via weekly videos on the evn website transmission and distribution publicly available data on high voltage cables with towers designed for voltages of 220kv and higher publicly available data on all existing power plants and those under construction with generation capacity equal or higher than 10 200 mw and 10 100 mw for renewables even if they are not connected to the high voltage network regularly updated a static map of transmission is publicly available this data was initially published in 2005 and updated again in 2016 working cost of capital wacc for renewable energy projects 2 5 per annum for utility scale onshore wind and solar pv projects in germany long term rates charged bystate owned commercial banks remain in the 8 10 per annum source carbon tracker analysis based on various sources concerns about balancing renewables will die hard without greater data transparency many people we spoke to expressed concerns about integrating wind and solar without costly and untimely investments in transmission and storage concerns about integrating wind and solar are not new in 2003 when wind made up 2 of annual generation in ireland the head of the national grid stated that this amount of wind generation does however pose an increased risk to the security and stability of the power system which the transmission system operator feels exceeds the level normally likely to be accepted by a prudent system operator wind now makes up over 20 of annual generation in ireland and during this time security of supply has increased high level analysis shows balancing renewables can be mitigated at low cost the international energy agency iea found integrating 0 15 renewables penetration only requires operational changes such as better supply and demand forecasting moreover scenario analysis by mckinsey company found renewables could make up 50 of vietnam s power generation mix by 2030 with an addition 83 kw of transmission and 10 gw of local battery storage an outcome 10 cheaper than what is currently planned in pdp7 despite excellent analysis from the iea and others about the realities of getting wind and solar on the system without greater data transparency it is difficult to substantiate claims about grid balancing from the increased penetration of variable renewables pro coal policymaker decision tree could evn become a proxy for vietnam s fiscal health carbon tracker s view is that building coal power today equals high cost power and fiscal liabilities tomorrow if vietnamese policymakers remain committed to coal power the nation will be forced to make a difficult decision increase debt and taxes or undermine economic competitiveness through higher energy prices the figure below shows a basic decision tree for a policymaker who remains committed to coal power over the long term source carbon tracker analysis notes based on a discussion with indonesian colleagues adhityani putri cerasia and elrika hamdi ieefa in 2018 this situation is particularly challenging for policymakers in vietnam as debt as a percentage of gdp is reaching the ceiling of 65 and end consumers already receive subsidised electricity which is why evn s operating cashflow has historically been negative in our below 2 degree scenario where coal capacity is forced to shut down in a manner consistent with the temperature goal in the paris agreement the operating cashflow of vietnam s coal generation could decline by 6 5 bn relative to a business as usual scenario this figure only includes operating capacity and capacity under construction vietnam also has 32 gw of planned coal capacity which assuming a capital cost of 1 400 kw could have an overnight investment cost of over 40 bn for this reason if the vietnamese government continues to incentivise new coal evn s finances could become a proxy for understanding the nation s fiscal health a similar situation has already emerged in south africa eskom the nation s state owned utility was forced to subsidise power prices for the end consumer and resisted renewables in favour of coal in doing so eskom has now potentially undermined the financial outlook of the south african economy 1 what s next for carbon tracker the intention of here comes the sun and wind was threefold start a conversation about the economic potential of renewable energy showcase our data and build a rapport with local experts due to the nature of power supply and demand our levelised and marginal cost analysis is indicative of a wider megatrend eclipsing power markets globally as such we now need to prove unequivocally that coal will become a net liability to the end consumer and therefore the financial and economic interests of vietnam this is a challenge due to data transparency which results in decisionmakers most notably evn having a monopoly on information through data transparency carbon tracker in close collaboration with green id aims to showcase the economic opportunities of renewables and the financial risks of coal in doing so we hope to help the government minimise the fiscal liabilities associated with stranded coal assets and ensure the vietnamese people get access to the cheapest energy possible 1 for instance the south african reserve bank said in may this year the high level of the south african government s contingent liabilities and the high probability of significant amounts of these contingent liabilities materializing as well as eskom s current large debt levels pose a threat to south africa s sovereign credit rating written by matt gray head of power and utilities
oil oil lower on global growth concerns oil prices fell close to 1 percent on thursday the lack of volume due to the us independence day was a factor with traders looking for the market to regain full force ahead of the release of the us employment report for june us crude inventories registered another drawdown but given the expectations set by the api a day earlier it was a miss by shrinking for less than anticipated global growth remains the main factor holding back crude prices trade disputes have hurt estimates as more agencies and central banks downgrade growth forecasts as trade headwinds get stronger without shutting the door on the us china dispute the us has now targeted the eu manufacturing data around the globe is beginning to show signs of deceleration attributed to the trade war one of the main reasons behind central banks so eager to restart the easing engines is the pressure protectionism is putting on economic growth so they must step in with more stimulus even though their arsenal is depleted the opec announced a 9 month extension to their production cut agreement after a successful meeting between saudi arabia and russia in japan in the sideline of the g20 russia played hard to get until the end but given the low forecasts they have for internal budget current prices are acceptable it is the volatility that could put pressure on russian producers to break away from the group but that is something for next year to ponder the opec deal will keep prices from falling too hard but there must be an end to trade protectionism to assure the demand for energy products recovers oil is also under pressure from higher us production the us is now positioned to become a net exporter and is not bound by the production limit agreement this could further drive prices lower gold gold drops slightly but awaiting signs of us economic slowdown gold fell 0 2 percent during the thursday trading session the fourth of july holiday came at the right time for the us dollar as it gave the currency time to get its footing after fed fund rate cut anticipation had depreciated the greenback the nfp report on friday could add another soft data point to the narrative of a slowdown of american growth the fed was forced to a 180 degree turn after lifting its benchmark rate in december and being on the verge of cutting the interest rate to avoid a recession gold has risen as the fed preached patience and is now ready to remove some of the tightening it added last year the yellow metal is also having a moment as it retakes the safe haven crown away from the us dollar trade uncertainty in particular more than one trade front open at the same time has given the edge to gold in the eyes of investors despite a cordial meeting between trump and xi at the g20 the biggest takeaway was a restart of negotiations negotiations that are still far apart in key topics with neither side willing to concede geopolitical concerns are keeping gold bid as the middle east situation could once again flare up with the us taking a less diplomatic approach to iran and although awaiting a new leader the uk is gearing to get brexit done once and for all stocks indices mixed ahead of us jobs report the fourth of july holiday made for a low volume day of trading with most major indices stuck in a tight range awaiting the u s non farm payrolls nfp due on friday equities have rallied on the back of a most likely rate cut by the federal reserve and the lower than expected us private payrolls report earlier in the week the fed is independent from the white house even though president trump has been very aggressive that the us central bank needs to lower rates and depreciate the dollar to make us exports more competitive the fed is likely to cut the benchmark rate later this month by 25 basis points this fact alone has boosted stock markets around the globe and put pressure on the dollar and bonds emerging markets offer higher yields to investors so they will be more attractive as major economies are looking to cut rates or keep them low risk appetite has improved but the biggest obstacle for an em rally is a full blown trade war us china remains unresolved and the us is looking to pick a tariff fight with the eu the rally in equities has been driven by dovish central bank rhetoric the stock market has not been too concerned with the trade war as the tariffs have avoided hitting consumer goods so far there is still upside if a true trade agreement materializes between the us and china and the fed keeps cutting rates as expected geopolitical issues like brexit middle east tensions and the trade war have been an inconvenience but not enough to derail the record setting pace a resolution on such fronts could expand the bullish run into next year but as more headwinds add up it could signal the end of the party v
new haven when governments permit counterfeiting or copying of american products it is stealing our future and it is no longer free trade so said us president ronald reagan commenting on japan after the plaza accord was concluded in september 1985 today resembles in many respects a remake of this 1980s movie but with a reality television star replacing a hollywood film star in the presidential leading role and with a new villain in place of japan back in the 1980s japan was portrayed as america s greatest economic threat not only because of allegations of intellectual property theft but also because of concerns about currency manipulation state sponsored industrial policy a hollowing out of us manufacturing and an outsize bilateral trade deficit in its standoff with the united states japan ultimately blinked but it paid a steep price for doing so nearly three lost decades of economic stagnation and deflation today the same plot features china notwithstanding both countries objectionable mercantilism japan and china had something else in common they became victims of america s unfortunate habit of making others the scapegoat for its own economic problems like japan bashing in the 1980s china bashing today is an outgrowth of america s increasingly insidious macroeconomic imbalances in both cases a dramatic shortfall in us domestic saving spawned large current account and trade deficits setting the stage for battles 30 years apart with asia s two economic giants advertisement when reagan took office in january 1981 the net domestic saving rate stood at 7 8 percent of national income and the current account was basically balanced within two and a half years courtesy of reagan s wildly popular tax cuts the domestic saving rate had plunged to 3 7 percent and the current account and the merchandise trade balances swung into perpetual deficit in this important respect america s so called trade problem was very much of its own making yet the reagan administration was in denial there was little or no appreciation of the link between saving and trade imbalances instead the blame was pinned on japan which accounted for 42 percent of us goods trade deficits in the first half of the 1980s japan bashing then took on a life of its own with a wide range of grievances over unfair and illegal trade practices leading the charge back then was a young deputy us trade rep named robert lighthizer fast forward some 30 years and the similarities are painfully evident unlike reagan us president donald trump did not inherit a us economy with an ample reservoir of saving when trump took office in january 2017 the net domestic saving rate was just 3 percent well below half the rate at the onset of the reagan era but like his predecessor who waxed eloquently of a new morning in america trump also opted for large tax cuts this time to make america great again the result was a predictable widening of the federal budget deficit which more than offset the cyclical surge in private saving that normally accompanies a maturing economic expansion as a result the net domestic saving rate actually edged down to 2 8 percent of national income by late 2018 keeping america s international balances deep in the red with the current account deficit at 2 6 percent of gross domestic product gdp and the merchandise trade gap at 4 5 percent in late 2018 and that s where china assumes the role that japan played in the 1980s on the surface the threat seems more dire after all china accounted for 48 percent of the us merchandise trade deficit in 2018 compared to japan s 42 percent share in the first half of the 1980s but the comparison is distorted by global supply chains which basically didn t exist in the 1980s data from the organisation for economic co operation and development and the world trade organization suggest that about 35 40 percent of the bilateral us china trade deficit reflects inputs made outside of china but assembled and shipped to the united states from china that means the made in china portion of today s us trade deficit is actually smaller than japan s share of the 1980s like the japan bashing of the 1980s today s outbreak of china bashing has been conveniently excised from america s broader macroeconomic context that is a serious mistake without raising national saving highly unlikely under the current us budget trajectory trade will simply be shifted away from china to america s other trading partners with this trade diversion likely to migrate to higher cost platforms around the world american consumers will be hit with the functional equivalent of a tax hike ironically trump has summoned the same robert lighthizer veteran of the japan trade battles of the 1980s to lead the charge against china unfortunately lighthizer seems as clueless about the macro argument today as he was back then advertisement in both episodes the united states was in denial bordering on delusion basking in the warm glow of untested supply side economics especially the theory that tax cuts would be self financing the reagan administration failed to appreciate the links between mounting budget and trade deficits today the seductive power of low interest rates coupled with the latest strain of voodoo economics modern monetary theory is equally alluring for the trump administration and a bipartisan consensus of china bashers in the us congress the tough macroeconomic constraints facing a saving short us economy are ignored for good reason there is no us political constituency for reducing trade deficits by cutting budget deficits and thereby boosting domestic saving america wants to have its cake and eat it with a health care system that swallows 18 percent of its gdp defense spending that exceeds the combined sum of the world s next seven largest military budgets and tax cuts that have reduced federal government revenue to 16 5 percent of gdp well below the 17 4 percent average of the past 50 years this remake of an old movie is disconcerting to say the least once again the united states has found it far easier to bash others japan then china now than to live within its means this

menafn khaleej times indian finance minister nirmala sitharaman hit all the right notes in her maiden budget drawing almost undivided applause from non resident indian businessmen and professionals in the uae through her budget speech lasting nearly two hours sitharaman inspired non residents with a promise to transform india into a 3 trillion global economic power this year and to further propel its growth with a goal to reach 5 trillion in the next few years however for most non residents the most promising budget proposal was the issuance of aadhaar cards on arrival without the mandatory waiting period of 180 days to be eligible for it following are the excerpts from their reaction to narendra modi 2 0 government s first budget yusuffali m a chairman of lulu group as expected the budget has covered almost all critical sectors which will surely boost india s march towards becoming a 5 trillion economy the key take aways for me are the stress given to rural and agricultural development women entrepreneurship and making india the global education hub of excellence the plan to revitalise the railways the backbone of our internal trade is highly encouraging dr b r shetty founder of nmc healthcare and finablr a well balanced budget that seeks to boost to startups women and youth further ease of doing business in india is expected to attract bigger flow of foreign investors the study in india programme is a great move the focus on agricultural investment research and technology aviation infrastructure and affordable housing are positive steps dr azad moopen founder chairman and managing director of aster dm healthcare it is very good to hear that we are striving to become a 5 trillion economy soon however regarding nris and the healthcare sector there is not much to sing about it is good to know that nris shall be allowed to take aadhar card p n c menon chairman of sobha group proposed tax benefits and interest deduction up to rs350 000 for houses priced up to rs4 5 million will help stimulate demand for the affordable housing segment and is expected to attract first time homebuyers the move by the government to introduce a new tenancy law will help streamline the unorganised indian rental market which is estimated to be an around 20 billion mohan valrani senior vice chairman and managing director of al shirawi group the best feature is the rs700 billion bank recapitalisation plus the fact that the government is going to borrow abroad that will ease the overall borrowing rate the priority given to the education sector will ensure india s schools future ready with a deeper focus on research and new age skills such as robotics and ai dr ram buxani chairman of itl cosmos group india s first woman finance minister in her maiden budget has tried to establish that women can manage the money better billions of dollars are being spent by indians in studying in the united states and other countries where students are indian money is indian faculty is indian but only soil is foreign now on indian soil education will be provided this is a great development paras shahdadpuri chairman of nikai group of companies and president of business leaders forum the finance minister has done a good job in promoting rural india which can generate new jobs while releasing the pressures on urban cities for the first time role of nris was mentioned twice however major steps to create jobs were not visible more allocation on health and education could have been announced revenue side was not fully spelt out faizal kottikollon chairman of kef holdings the budget s proposal to simplify tax administration and bring greater transparency seeks to stimulate growth incentivise affordable housing and encourage startups with focus on inclusive growth and infrastructure the budget is pro development rizwan sajan founder and chairman of danube group the budget looks very positive with overall focus on improving standard of living by providing piped water electricity gas housing and toilets to all the government is definitely focusing on transforming rural india which is a good sign for the development of the nation dr dhananjay datar chairman and managing director of al adil group i see the support of private entrepreneurship with regards to the farm sector as a great game changer this is a conscious effort to bring majority of the indian population who are directly or indirectly dependent on the agricultural sector into the mainstream the 10 000 new farm produce organisations and 80 livelihood business incubators to be set up under aspire to develop 75 000 skilled entrepreneurs in agro rural industries will be a big boost kamal vachani group director of al maya group one significant proposal is that corporate tax would be reduced to 25 per cent for companies with a turnover of up to rs4 billion the budget offers big relief for homebuyers who have taken loans the issuance of aadhar has been simplified to benefit nris easing of fdi in media and aviation sectors will bring more investments shaji ul mulk chairman of mulk holdings massive spending in infrastructure will help the economy to expand fast and the government s plans to upgrade about 125 000km of road connecting rural areas over the next five years at an estimated cost of rs802 5 billion will change the landscape dramatically nris have reasons to cheer as they will easily get the adhaar card a very important move taher shams managing director of zulekha healthcare group i commend the target of making india a 5 trillion economy by 2025 over the years the reduced external debt and disinvestments have been beneficial thanks to the provision of interesting investment schemes and rebates on house and corporate taxes that will encourage growth additionally digitalisation of operations across sectors is the need of the hour and a promising move to bridge gaps in efficiencies nimish makvana president of the indian business professional council dubai the initiative of calling for investments in the infrastructure sector shows strong vision the reduction in red tape for better governance is a loud and clear message for growth and transparency of government the intention to open investments with fdi in aviation insurance and media sectors will have big flow of investments and a great opportunity for business the community outside india mahmood bangara chairman of the institute of chartered accountants of india dubai chapter focus on infrastructure will result in high efficiency across all sectors a clear road map is drawn for overall rural and urban growth tax on fuel surcharge on higher income can hinder growth the recapitalisation of banks will create more liquidity in the market bharat bhatia ceo of conares proposals to simplify tax administration and bring greater transparency to stimulate the economic growth and promote inclusive development are welcome the government spending assumes huge significance on infrastructure development in the next five years the move to attract foreign and domestic tourists with the government s plan to develop 17 iconic tourism sites as world class tourist centres is commendable adeeb ahamed managing director of lulu financial group and twenty14 holdings focus on connectivity infrastructure media and digital technology coupled with ease of living ease of doing business and digital literacy echoes the sentiments of the interim budget the proposal for skilling india reforming the education system and promoting women led entrepreneurship will also enhance the economy to a large extent sunny kulathakkal president of the global organisation of people of indian origin the integration of pan and aadhar card is a pragmatic step the huge investment proposed for railways and the ppp model of development and investments in infrastructure will have a far reaching positive impact t n manoharan non executive chairman of canara bank huge investment on infrastructure is expected to provide stimulus for aviation water ways roads and rail transportation sectors initiatives to make india an attractive destination for fdi and measures to tap and bring in foreign funds and savings are welcome naveen sharma head of accounting audit advisory services focus group at ibpc a step in the right direction to transform the indian economy from an informal to a formal one and to reach a 5 trillion target by 2024 the aadhar card on arrival for nris instead of waiting for 180 days is a game changer the ability for foreign investors to buy debt of listed real estate trusts is again an opportunity for nris to be part of the real estate story k v shamsudheen director at barjeel geojit financial services to get an aadhaar card one has to be in india more than 182 days now the government had decided to remove that clause i appeal to the government to provide an aadhaar application processing and delivering facility in all diplomatic missions presently the passport is issued though the indian network with biometric identification so processing of aadhaar also will be possible same network pradeep kumar t p chief executive officer uae exchange unimoni
