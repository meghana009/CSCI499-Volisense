the next week matters for european policy makers eu finance ministers are meeting in brussels on april 5 and 6 this will be followed by an emergency european council summit on april 10 at which eu leaders will not only discuss brexit but also discuss the european union s position on negotiating a narrow free trade agreement with the united states on april 12 european finance ministers and central bank governors will take part in important group of twenty g 20 side discussions alongside the international monetary fund imf and world bank spring meetings in washington these leaders would have been focused on worrying signs of slumping global growth and trade tensions with the united states but leaks to reuters on april 3 suggest that policy makers are returning to another brexit sore point non bank financial regulation the leaks show european policy makers are beginning to raise concerns regarding capital markets and non bank financial institutions most of which are located in the united kingdom and the united states they are also reviving a focus on euro denominated securities most of which are traded and settled in london it seems that euro area policymakers have turned a corner and are preparing to create a framework for future european financial sovereignty as described in this speech today in bucharest by the french central bank governor who is also a board member of the european central bank these issues last took center stage at the eu summit in december 2011 this was where and how brexit began before migration issues xenophobia unicorns russian internet trolls extremist politicians trade policy northern ireland the withdrawal agreement indicative votes and the customs union dominated the brexit dynamic british and eu leaders were locked in opposition regarding governance and sovereignty issues with respect to who exercises what kind of regulation over the euro and the financial system in which the euro trades seeing these issues arise again sends strong signals about how toxic the brexit situation has become in europe we are either seeing a clever last minute european attempt to coerce compromise from the uk or we are seeing the last straw that will push the uk into a hard brexit how british policy makers react now will determine the policy trajectory with potential spillovers to the transatlantic relationship how did we get here context matters greatly at the time of the december 2011 eu summit in brussels the global financial crisis had morphed into a euro area sovereign debt crisis large banks and sovereign governments across europe ireland portugal spain greece belgium france cyprus italy and germany teetered under the weight of non performing loans and other economic woes a newly elected british prime minister collided with a euro area leadership struggling to save europe s common currency economies and banking systems it wasn t pretty by the time it was all over five of the countries portugal ireland spain greece and cyprus had received bailout packages from the imf multiple new treaties were negotiated signed ratified and implemented among euro area governments focused on strengthening financial sector and fiscal policy oversight the european central bank and eu level financial regulators acquired significant new authority the european commission found itself often sidelined as euro area governments reclaimed considerable decision making authority they had previously delegated to brussels as european leaders scrambled to save the euro they found unity by resisting british policy priorities major media outlets the economist the financial times the telegraph euractiv provided the play by play through leaked documents and official statements three key dimensions drove the dramatic discord fiscal union dramas faced with potential bank and sovereign bond defaults the euro area needed a mechanism to funnel financial support to hard hit economies however the maastricht treaty expressly prohibited fiscal transfers within the euro area leaks to euractiv indicated that then eu council president herman van rompuy would propose a technical solution designed to embed the maastricht economic policy targets into national constitutions rather than seek treaty changes in order for that approach to succeed a unanimous vote was needed at the december 2011 eu summit the need for unanimity empowered the uk to negotiate in exchange for delivering political support to the eurozone crisis era financial regulation dramas crisis driven financial regulation initiatives were in full swing policy makers globally had agreed to increase bank capital requirements parallel initiatives sought to expand the regulatory perimeter and tighten regulation of central counterparties sifis systemically important financial institutions credit rating agencies significant non bank financial institutions like asset managers including insurance companies and derivatives markets uk policy makers sought to impose gold plating requirements on top of those international standards arguing that london as a global financial capital required more stringent standards in certain areas in order to avoid the troubles on display in the euro area separately continental policy makers led by france sought to impose a financial transactions tax on securities markets transactions finally regulators globally were trying to define a policy regarding cross border bank resolution as the lehman brothers and aig situations had illustrated resolving large complex cross border financial firms can create fiscal policy issues uk policy makers refused to bail out these firms in the autumn of 2008 as of april 2019 no agreed international standards exist regarding cross border resolution although a resolution agency has been created in europe the uk is not a member british demands initially the differences of opinion regarding technical financial services policy did not seem unusual civil law countries traditionally prefer to see intermediation through banks rather than through the capital markets favored by common law countries british prime minister david cameron arrived at the december 2011 summit primed to protect the uk from euro area policy priorities the telegraph published a leaked document showing that cameron sought a formal uk veto over future eu policies in three areas i eu regulatory agency authority ii minimum harmonization provisions that would effectively prohibit uk gold plating and iii fiscal measures such as a financial transactions tax or a deposit insurance premium in bucharest on april 5 french central bank governor villeroy de galhau expressly called for giving more power to the esas european supervisory agencies additionally cameron sought to grandfather passporting rights into the eu for non european financial firms located in london even as he sought to exclude uk firms from contributing to european deposit insurance systems finally he challenged european central bank policy that would require euro denominated transactions to be cleared at institutions physically located in the eurozone in other words the uk arrived at the 2011 summit seeking to safeguard uk sovereignty over financial sector policy euro area heads of state arrived seeking to save their common currency their interests were not aligned summit negotiations collapsed the euro area charged ahead creating multiple new european treaties and institutions the uk sued the european central bank at the european court of justice and won on the issue of location policy for central clearing uk eu relations deteriorated in a referendum on june 23 2016 a majority of british voters decided to leave the eu the british government then triggered article 50 of the eu s lisbon treaty which outlines the steps to be taken by a country seeking to leave the bloc voluntarily why it matters the issues that led to the historic break at the december 2011 summit resurfaced this week this is not a good development it signals a hardening of positions in europe the policy shifts are certain to stiffen some spines in london regarding brexit the april 3 reuters leaks indicate that eu finance ministers intend to tighten capital market regulation with a particular focus on non banks that are not headquartered in the eu this is consistent with a civil law tradition that favors bank centered intermediation over volatile capital markets but it also delivers an implicit warning to the uk and the united states that european policy challenges will increase following brexit those policies take direct aim at the capital markets and firms that constitute a significant percentage of gross domestic product gdp in the united states and the uk the leaked policies also take direct aim at large us and british firms that currently benefit from passporting terms that permit them to enter the eu financial services market from their offices in london the leaks make clear that eu policy makers believe these practices expose the currency union to unacceptable financial stability risks the solution will be regulation that reins in these economically significant entities after brexit the implication will not be lost on policy makers in london and washington european policy makers are also poised to accelerate their efforts to exercise sovereignty over transactions denominated in their common currency possibly on an extraterritorial basis reuters reports that the single resolution board a central resolution authority within the banking union has expressed interest to the european parliament in expanding the perimeter of resolution authority to cover central clearing including central clearing operations undertaken by investment banks what comes next the customs union and avoiding a physical border in northern ireland are important for many reasons but the reality is that trade in goods constitutes only a small portion of the british gdp the leaks from eu finance ministers imply that eu policy makers are taking aim at elements far more central to the british economy it is not clear that raising these issues now creates any incentives for policy makers in london to compromise because agreement on a customs union would not address the financial stability now in play once again uk policy makers have vigilantly protected their monetary policy and regulatory independence the uk never intended to join the single currency when it joined the eu it refused to participate in major foreign bank bailouts emanating from the united states in 2008 and the euro area from 2010 to 2012 serious efforts by eu regulators to extend their standards extraterritorially into london could easily provide pro brexit policy makers in london one more reason to resist compromise barbara c matthews is a nonresident senior fellow with the atlantic council s global business economics program she has served as a senior us government official in brussels as the

home recent posts pages temple institute excited to announce the birth of two red heifer candidates could jesus possibly have been resurrected on a sunday saudi threatens to ditch petro dollar trade scheme cogwriter the us may be risking having oil help back up the value of its dollar saudi threatens to ditch petro dollar trade scheme 05 april 2019 london dubai reuters saudi arabia is threatening to sell its oil in currencies other than the dollar if washington passes a bill exposing opec members to u s antitrust lawsuits three sources familiar with saudi energy policy said the chances of the u s bill known as nopec coming into force are slim and saudi arabia would be unlikely to follow through but the fact riyadh is considering such a drastic step is a sign of the kingdom s annoyance about potential u s legal challenges to opec in the unlikely event riyadh were to ditch the dollar it would undermine the its status as the world s main reserve currency reduce washington s clout in global trade and weaken its ability to enforce sanctions on nation states the saudis know they have the dollar as the nuclear option one of the sources familiar with the matter said the saudis say let the americans pass nopec and it would be the u s economy that would fall apart another source said 04 04 19 what is the petrodollar essentially it is the fact that although the us dollar is no longer backed by gold since most oil is priced in us dollars that gives the us dollar a backing in through a needed commodity this insures that internationally the us dollar will have value so it is sometimes called a petrodollar here is more about that after the collapse of the bretton woods gold standard in the early 1970s the u s struck a deal with saudi arabia to standardize oil prices in dollar terms through this deal the petrodollar system was born along with a paradigm shift away from pegged exchanged rates and gold backed currencies to non backed floating rate regimes the petrodollar system elevated the u s dollar to the world s reserve currency and through this status the u s is able to enjoy persistent trade deficits and become a global economic hegemony the petrodollar system also provides the united states financial markets with a source of liquidity and foreign capital inflows through petrodollar recycling however before the effects of the petrodollars on the u s dollar can be examined a brief history lesson is in order since the most sought after commodity in the world oil is priced in u s dollars the petrodollar helped elevated the greenback as the world s dominant currency in fact according to the bank for international settlements bis triennial survey 87 percent of all foreign exchanges deals initiated in april 2013 involved the usd on one side with this status the u s dollar was able to enjoy what some have asserted to be an exorbitant privilege of perpetually financing its current account deficit by issuing dollar denominated assets at very low rates of interest as well as becoming a global economic hegemony for instance countries like china who hold vast quantities of u s debt have voiced their concerns in the past about the possible dilutive effects to their asset holdings should the dollar depreciate however the privileges associated with being able to run persistent current account deficits come at a price as the reserve currency the u s is obligated to run these deficits to fulfill reserve requirements in an ever in an ever expanding global economy if the united states were to stop running these deficits the resulting shortage of liquidity can pull the world into an economic contraction however if the persistent deficits continued ad infinitum eventually foreign countries will begin to doubt the valuation of the dollar and the greenback may lose its role as the reserve currency this is known as the triffin dilemma accessed 06 02 17 if enough oil producing nations stop pricing oil in us dollars the theory is that the us dollar will drop or even collapse someone said this could happen as early as 2015 market collapse then new world order in 2015 a long time financial adviser named harvey organ claims that claims that because of insufficient gold in the central banks of usa and uk that shanghai would bring about exposing this and that this would lead to a massive overnight rise in the price of gold and silver diminished value of their currencies he states a market collapse will occur before the end of 2014 that the petroyuan will replace the petrodollar and that a chinese led new world order will be in place for 2015 is this possible where does the leader of the new world order come from what does the bible teach this is a video although i did not believe such a collapse could have happened in 2015 nor do i believe such for 2019 the reality is that the bible tells of a time when the us will be taken over daniel 11 39 and its massive debts will be a reason that many will be opposed to it cf habakkuk 2 2 8 the existence of the petrodollar seems to have helped the usa be in a position to increase its debt and that will not end well cf habakkuk 2 2 8 daniel 11 39 see also

finance minister asad umar islamabad finance minis ter asad umar on friday said an agreement with international monetary fund imf for an economic assistance package would be signed by end of this month talking to a group of media persons the finance minister said the economic package would be finalised in principle with the fund during spring meetings april 12 14 of the world bank and imf in washington where he would hold discussions with the fund authorities this would be followed by an imf mission s visit to pakistan to formally conclude a programme for signing the finance minister said he would share the medium term macroeconomic framework with the standing committee of the national assembly on finance and revenue on monday to explain the government s economic roadmap over the next few years he further said he had committed to the parliamentary panel to strengthen the institution of na s standing committee mr umar denied reports that pakistan had agreed to the devaluation of rupee with the imf as claimed by former finance minister ishaq dar saying the imf had not even demanded currency depreciation imf discussions with the sbp are in progress on exchange rate management but not at all on fixing rupee dollar rate he added he reiterated that this programme would be pakistan s last programme and noted that the recent depreciation of rupee is being fuelled by speculations and fake news otherwise the sbp had announced in clear terms that rupee had achieved its equilibrium he advised people not to be misled by rumours to invest in dollar and instead invest in stocks and real estate that had reached their lower levels and would rebound he however explained that depreciation until a week or 10 days ago was due to increase in demand of the dollar owing to large current account deficit cad of 19 billion this increase happens after every four to five years due to the current account deficit he said during the last five year tenure of pakistan muslim league nawaz pml n cad increased from 2 5bn in 2013 to 19bn in 2018 the then government had taken the imf programme owing to balance of payment crisis in 2013 the situation was much worse in 2018 when cad reached 19bn and was increasing at an average pace of 2bn monthly in the last three months of its tenure the finance minister said the top priority of the current government is to stop and reduce cad the government has been able to curtail the eight month trade deficit to 21 5bn from 24bn of the same period last year while cad was contained to 8 5bn in eight months from 11bn of the same period last year the minister said there was no denying the fact that high inflation is affecting people but it is nothing when compared to the first eight months of the two tenures of the pakistan people s party ppp and pml n governments he said inflation had increased by 25 per cent in first eight months of ppp and 10pc in eight months of pml n while it went up by 10 8pc during the same period of the current government the finance minister said foreign direct investment in first seven months of the pti government maintained upward journey and stood at 1 441bn compared to 573m during the same period under the pml n government according to umar when the government took measures for restructuring and straightening the fundamentals of national economy the economic slowdown occurred adding that it would gain the momentum and would be on path of growth soon he said despite these challenges many sectors of the national economy were showing positive growth including industrial sector of the country as cement production grew by 1 7pc urea production by 5 9pc sale of automobiles by 4pc and gas supply by 6pc the minister said previous government had presented fake figures of economic development including gdp growth poverty and other micro and macroeconomic indicators published in dawn april 6th 2019
u s review softer first quarter coming into focus the recent but temporary inversion of the yield curve deepened worries that the next recession could be sooner than many forecasters are anticipating recent data continue to suggest a softer first quarter but with the underlying fundamentals of the u s economy generally solid at present talk of an imminent recession is a bit overdone in our view with the moderation in job growth and wage growth showing no further signs of acceleration in march it remains unlikely that the fomc will alter its patient stance any time soon softer first quarter coming into focus weaker economic data have sparked fear of recession and the recent but temporary inversion of the yield curve chart on front page deepened worries that the next recession could be sooner than many forecasters are anticipating recent data continue to suggest a softer first quarter but with the underlying fundamentals of the u s economy generally solid at present talk of an imminent recession is a bit overdone in our view absent some unforeseen shock talking ourselves into a recession seems to be the most realistic way the u s economy could experience one in the foreseeable future nevertheless the economy is certainly losing momentum a main area of concern is the consumer accounting for almost 70 of gdp a large retrenchment in consumer spending would materially weigh on economic growth consumer spending data have been extraordinarily choppy in recent months and the mixed february retail sales report served as the latest affirmation that the consumer is in a bit of a soft patch retail sales declined 0 2 in february but january s gain was revised more than three times higher than initially reported control group sales which feed into the calculation of personal consumption expenditures in gdp estimates also fell 0 2 that nudged the three month annualized rate to 2 1 a rate not seen outside of a recession in the past 15 years top chart other data suggest risks are stacked to the downside for q1 consumer spending but our sense is that this weakness is likely temporary equipment spending is also shaping up to be a weak spot in the first quarter as u s manufacturing activity is under pressure from slower domestic demand and the still uncertain trade environment durable goods orders fell 1 6 in february and while nondefense capital goods shipments rose 0 6 the 1 5 drop in january suggests only a tepid pace of equipment spending in the first quarter while the manufacturing sector still faces challenges the ism manufacturing survey allayed some fears that u s factory activity is slowing dramatically the ism nonmanufacturing index on the other hand fell to a 20 month low in march however both the manufacturing and non manufacturing indices remain firmly in expansion territory middle chart consistent with the economy continuing to grow just at a slower rate than last year the employment picture remained positive employers added 196 000 jobs in march welcome news after the largely disappointing gain in february bottom chart while the most recent print was slightly stronger than expected it still suggests that the overall trend in hiring is moderating from the robust pace of job growth we saw last year but by just about any measure the labor market remains exceptionally tight adding to our view that a prolonged retrenchment in consumer spending remains unlikely with the moderation in job growth and wage growth showing no further signs of acceleration in march it remains unlikely that the fomc will alter its patient policy stance any time soon economic growth is set to moderate this year but after what we suspect to be a weak first quarter gdp growth should return to a trend like pace in the second quarter u s outlook factory orders monday slower growth at home and abroad alongside lingering uncertainty surrounding trade policy has put a damper on u s manufacturing activity the advance durable goods report for february showed orders falling 1 6 nondefense capital goods orders ex aircraft an indicator of business investment in equipment held up better but have declined 3 4 on a three month average annualized basis monday s report will provide an updated estimate on february capex spending but the new information in the report will be for orders and shipments for nondurable goods nondurables account for half of u s factory orders and have come under pressure the past few months as energy prices which influence the value of petroleum and chemical orders have fallen we look for a slight increase in nondurable orders in february however which should limit the decline in total factory orders to 0 6 previous 0 1 wells fargo 0 6 consensus 0 5 consumer price index wednesday consumer price inflation remained tame in february with headline prices increasing 0 2 and core prices advancing just 0 1 we expect price growth to heat up a bit in march gas prices according to aaa rose more than 9 last month which should help lift headline inflation to 0 4 meanwhile core prices are expected to increase 0 2 driven in part by a rebound in medical care costs even with a pickup in march the overall trend in inflation should be little changed core inflation is expected to remain at 2 1 on a yearago basis which is close to the fed s goal an upside surprise to the core index would suggest that inflation is picking up on trend and reduce market expectations for a fed rate cut later this year a downside miss on core inflation however would give the fomc another reason to be patient in adjusting rates despite continued strength in the labor market previous 0 2 wells fargo 0 4 consensus 0 3 month over month producer price index thursday producer price inflation has weakened since the start of the year with the ppi for final demand easing to 1 9 year over year from more than 3 as recently as october the slowdown partly reflects weaker energy prices since last fall but ppi inflation for non food and energy goods has moderated as has price growth for services we look for energy prices to lift the headline index 0 3 in march core inflation is also expected to rise faster than in february as weakness from the volatile trade services component which is measured by margins not selling prices reverses the duration of the upturn will likely be limited however as growth in input prices for goods and services even when excluding food and energy has weakened recently previous 0 1 wells fargo 0 3 consensus 0 3 month over month global review stronger pmi readings temper global growth fears stronger than expected readings on purchasing manager indices in china and the united kingdom kicked off the week on a positive note a solid retail sales print in the eurozone was also encouraging although the divergence between the service and manufacturing sectors appeared to widen further like many of the other major central banks around the world the reserve bank of india took a dovish turn this week cutting its main policy rate 25 basis points stronger pmi readings temper global growth fears stronger than expected readings on purchasing manager indices pmis in china and the united kingdom kicked off the week on a positive note china s caixin manufacturing pmi rose to 50 8 in march up from 49 9 in february and a multi year low of 48 3 in january see chart on front page while the reading was still fairly soft on an absolute basis the improvement over the past couple months offers some signs that the monetary and fiscal stimulus enacted by chinese policymakers is beginning to take hold a few hours later pmi data for the united kingdom s manufacturing sector also topped expectations rising to 55 1 in march compared to expectations for a slight decline to 51 2 although we are skeptical of such a strong reading see the global outlook section for more the positive back to back prints assuaged some fears about the global slowdown and helped spark a general rally in risk assets over the course of the week retail sales data for the eurozone were also encouraging real retail sales climbed 0 4 in february bringing the year over year change to 2 8 although retail sales growth has clearly slowed over the past couple years it has shown signs of stabilizing of late top chart this pick up suggests the consumer sector in europe remains in decent shape even as the factory sector has struggled to that point the final march pmi readings for the eurozone showed an upward revision to services to 53 3 from 52 7 but continued weakness in manufacturing to 47 5 from 47 6 as economic growth has slowed in the eurozone price growth has also cooled data released this week showed core consumer price inflation in the eurozone was just 0 8 year over year in march the lowest reading in almost a year in the foreword to its annual report released on april 1 european central bank ecb president mario draghi noted that substantial monetary policy stimulus remains essential to ensure continued build up of domestic price pressures over the medium term like many of the other major central banks around the world the reserve bank of india rbi took a dovish turn this week cutting its main policy rates 25 basis points the rbi noted that the domestic economy is facing headwinds especially on the global front though economic growth remains robust compared to most countries real gdp growth in india has slowed over the past couple quarters and private investment growth has been sluggish in addition inflation pressures have been fairly muted as the consumer price index was up just 2 6 in february at the low end of the rbi s target of 4 with a tolerable band 2 middle chart while the data appear weak enough to justify some policy easing the timing comes on the eve of national elections in india given the recent questions surrounding possible political interference in the rbi the recent policy move is unlikely to ease concerns about the central bank s independence canadian employment rounded out the week with a negative print employment fell by 7 200 in march though this came on the heels of a strong february reading trend employment growth remains solid in canada bottom chart and we believe this should help drive the bank of canada to hike rates once again later this year global outlook mexico gross fixed investment monday gross fixed capital formation growth has been weak in mexico over the past few years as trade uncertainty and high real interest rates have weighed on capital investment next week s release will offer the first monthly data on capital formation in mexico in 2019 as we discussed in a recent special report on the outlook for mexico s economy fixed capital formation is perhaps what the mexican economy needs the most at present mexico s oil industry has badly lagged behind its robust counterpart in the united states it s production of petroleum peaked at nearly 3 5 million barrels per day in the mid 2000s and has since declined by 50 to about 1 6 million barrels per day at present while solving the oil energy s woes would likely not be enough for a full reversal of the mexican economy steady growth in capital investment is key to faster productivity growth without it it will be much harder for mexico to return to its historically high rates of economic growth previous 6 8 year over year u k industrial production wednesday the u k economy has been surprisingly resilient despite uncertainty around brexit at least when the data are taken at face value gdp growth rebounded in january with a 0 5 month over month gain amid strong manufacturing output while retail sales beat expectations in the first two months of 2019 in march the u k manufacturing pmi jumped to 55 1 the highest in nearly a year while this strength is encouraging particularly as it relates to consumer demand it appears that at least some of the recent strength has been the result of inventory building as manufacturers prepare for a potential no deal brexit on a year over year basis the trend in industrial production is hardly encouraging see chart to left while stockpiling activity may boost q1 real gdp growth in the u k there may be some payback over the second and third quarters were a no deal brexit to occur a drag on growth from inventories would likely be the last thing the u k economy needs previous 0 9 year over year consensus 0 8 european central bank wednesday we do not expect any major policy changes from the european central bank ecb at its meeting next week though we may get some additional details on the next phase of targeted longer term refining operations tltros as was discussed in the global review section growth and inflation in the eurozone remain tepid and this in turn has pushed back any plans the ecb had in regards to tightening monetary policy in 2019 we continue to expect eurozone economic growth and inflation to stabilize over the next couple quarters and this should help forestall any additional outright easing by the central bank even if things stabilize however the ecb will likely proceed with caution some eurozone economies like italy are either in or close to recessions and core consumer price inflation has been below 1 5 since august 2012 unless economic conditions improve significantly we think the first rate hike from the ecb will not occur until at least q1 2020 previous 0 40 deposit rate consensus 0 40 point of view interest rate watch ecb on hold for foreseeable future the european central bank released the minutes of its march 7 policy meeting this week which offered some further insights into the current thinking of the governing council as communicated in the march 7 policy announcement the governing council pushed out the timing of when it expects to start raising rates which have been held at historically low levels for three years top chart ecb policymakers had expected that its three main policy rates would remain unchanged through summer 2019 however due to recent signs of economic weakness that pointed to a sizeable moderation in the pace of the economic expansion that would extend into the current year as well as the persistence of uncertainties the governing council now thinks that rates will be on hold through at least the end of this year as discussed on page 5 we think the first rate hike from the ecb will not occur until at least q1 2020 consequently we believe that the value of the euro vis à vis the u s dollar will remain roughly unchanged for the foreseeable future middle chart brexit the bank of england the bank of england does not hold a policy meeting until may 2 but the uncertainty associated with the ongoing brexit saga means that the monetary policy committee mpc likely will continue to keep its main policy rate unchanged at 0 75 for the time being bottom chart as discussed on page 4 the uncertainty of the economic outlook showed up in the march pmis which were released this week although the british parliament voted this week to take the option of a hard brexit off of the table economic uncertainty remains the new rules that will govern the economic and financial relationship between the united kingdom and the remaining 27 members of the european union still need to be negotiated we have been assuming that a hard brexit would be avoided but we recently downgraded our gdp growth forecast for 2019 to 1 3 from 1 5 consequently we believe that the mpc will be on hold until this august when we look for it to nudge up its main policy rate another 25 bps and then remain on hold through the end of the year credit market insights banking sector resilient to real estate price declines financial institutions of all sizes have exposure to real estate through their lending portfolios suggesting that a significant decline in property prices could spell trouble for the banking sector and possibly feed through to a tightening in credit throughout the economy we have written that a downturn in commercial real estate prices would not likely be the catalyst for the next recession and the fed s most recent stress test results largely support this conclusion the largest financial institutions are much better capitalized than they were during the lead up to the financial crisis the last time that property prices reached all time highs and stress test results suggest that they would be able to continue lending in spite of loan portfolio losses yet smaller banks that are not subject to fed stress tests which collectively comprise about 20 of the banking sector tend to rely relatively more on real estate lending and benefit less from geographic diversification despite this heightened exposure new research from the san francisco fed indicates that only around one percent of these smaller banks would be undercapitalized as a result of the most severe portfolio loss scenarios specified under the fed stress tests despite broad based price appreciation across both commercial and residential real estate the banking sector which tightened lending standards and increased capital cushions in the aftermath of the financial crisis is not overly exposed to a downturn in prices therefore we do not expect for now the epicenter of the next recession to be the real estate sector topic of the week fallout from a potential border closure president trump had threatened to close the u s mexico border or at least parts of it due to the surge of central american migrants that have streamed into the country while recent comments suggest the threat of a border closure has lessened the possibility remains not only would a border closure stop many migrants from entering the country but it also could have disruptive effects on trade flows in a recent special report we discuss some of the economic implications if the president were to carry through with this threat last year american exports of goods to mexico totaled 265 billion while imports of goods exceeded 346 billion intra industry trade in transportation equipment was especially intensive as shown in the top chart the united states sent 33 billion worth of transportation goods south of the border last year while it received 120 billion from mexico the vast majority of which were auto imports about 64 billion of these auto imports were finished vehicles but roughly 50 billion were auto parts consequently a closure of the border could have a crippling effect on the u s auto industry how big of an impact could this have on the u s economy as shown in the bottom chart real value added in the motor vehicle industry totaled almost 130 billion in 2017 which represented 0 7 of all the real value added in the u s economy in that year under the extreme assumption that a closure of the border would cause all motor vehicle production in the united states to come to a complete halt then the direct hit to the u s economy would be about 2 5 billion per week but there would be multiplier effects if idle auto workers pared back their purchases of goods and services in terms of employment the american auto industry employs roughly one million people which represents 0 7 of total payrolls and the computer industry employs a comparable amount these workers could be idled under the extreme assumption that production in these industries completely shuts down realistically however a closure of the southern border likely would not be disruptive enough to cause a recession in the united states but the costs to growth could start to add up if the border were to remain closed for an extended period of time

especially if i have made an error here are the answers with discussion for yesterday s quiz the information provided should help you work out why you missed a question or three if you haven t already done the quiz from yesterday then have a go at it before you read the answers i hope this helps you develop an understanding of modern monetary theory mmt and its application to macroeconomic thinking comments as usual welcome especially if i have made an error question 1 if the external sector is in deficit overall and gdp growth rate is faster than the real interest rate then both the private domestic sector and the government sector overall can reduce their overall respective net liabilities the answer is false once again it is a test of one s basic understanding of the sectoral balances that can be derived from the national accounts some people write to me in an incredulous way about the balances if the external sector overall is in deficit then it is impossible for both the private domestic sector and government sector to run surpluses one of those two has to also be in deficit and national income adjustments will ensure that is the case in accordance with the accounting rules it doesn t matter how fast gdp is growing if a sector is in deficit then it cannot be reducing its their overall net liabilities to refresh your memory the sectoral balances are derived as follows the basic income expenditure model in macroeconomics can be viewed in at least two ways a from the perspective of the sources of spending and b from the perspective of the uses of the income produced bringing these two perspectives of the same thing together generates the sectoral balances from the sources perspective we write gdp c i g x m which says that total national income gdp is the sum of total final consumption spending c total private investment i total government spending g and net exports x m expression 1 tells us that total income in the economy per period will be exactly equal to total spending from all sources of expenditure we also have to acknowledge that financial balances of the sectors are impacted by net government taxes t which includes all taxes and transfer and interest payments the latter are not counted independently in the expenditure expression 1 further as noted above the trade account is only one aspect of the financial flows between the domestic economy and the external sector we have to include net external income flows fni adding in the net external income flows fni to expression 2 for gdp we get the familiar gross national product or gross national income measure gnp 2 gnp c i g x m fni to render this approach into the sectoral balances form we subtract total taxes and transfers t from both sides of expression 3 to get 3 gnp t c i g x m fni t now we can collect the terms by arranging them according to the three sectoral balances 4 gnp c t i g t x m fni the the terms in expression 4 are relatively easy to understand now the term gnp c t represents total income less the amount consumed less the amount paid to government in taxes taking into account transfers coming the other way in other words it represents private domestic saving the left hand side of equation 4 gnp c t i thus is the overall saving of the private domestic sector which is distinct from total household saving denoted by the term gnp c t in other words the left hand side of equation 4 is the private domestic financial balance and if it is positive then the sector is spending less than its total income and if it is negative the sector is spending more than it total income the term g t is the government financial balance and is in deficit if government spending g is greater than government tax revenue minus transfers t and in surplus if the balance is negative finally the other right hand side term x m fni is the external financial balance commonly known as the current account balance cad it is in surplus if positive and deficit if negative in english we could say that the private financial balance equals the sum of the government financial balance plus the current account balance we can re write expression 6 in this way to get the sectoral balances equation 5 s i g t cab which is interpreted as meaning that government sector deficits g t 0 and current account surpluses cab 0 generate national income and net financial assets for the private domestic sector conversely government surpluses g t 0 and current account deficits cab 0 reduce national income and undermine the capacity of the private domestic sector to add financial assets expression 5 can also be written as 6 g t where the term on the left hand side is the non government sector financial balance and is of equal and opposite sign to the government financial balance this is the familiar mmt statement that a government sector deficit surplus is equal dollar for dollar to the non government sector surplus deficit the sectoral balances equation says that total private savings s minus private investment i has to equal the public deficit spending g minus taxes t plus net exports exports x minus imports m plus net income transfers all these relationships equations hold as a matter of accounting and not matters of opinion consider the following graph and associated table of data which shows six states all states have a constant external deficit equal to 2 per cent of gdp light blue columns state 1 show a government running a surplus equal to 2 per cent of gdp green columns as a consequence the private domestic balance is in deficit of 4 per cent of gdp royal blue columns this cannot be a sustainable growth strategy because eventually the private domestic sector will collapse under the weight of its indebtedness and start to save at that point the fiscal drag from the fiscal surpluses will reinforce the spending decline and the economy would go into recession state 2 shows that when the fiscal surplus moderates to 1 per cent of gdp the private domestic deficit is reduced state 3 is a fiscal balance and then the private domestic deficit is exactly equal to the external deficit so the private sector spending more than they earn exactly funds the desire of the external sector to accumulate financial assets in the currency of issue in this country states 4 to 6 shows what happens when the fiscal position goes into deficit the private domestic sector given the external deficit can then start reducing its deficit and by state 5 it is in balance then by state 6 the private domestic sector is able to net save overall that is spend less than its income note also that the government balance equals exactly for as a per cent of gdp the non government balance the sum of the private domestic and external balances this is also a basic rule derived from the national accounts most countries currently run external deficits the crisis was marked by households reducing consumption spending growth to try to manage their debt exposure and private investment retreating the consequence was a major spending gap which pushed governments into deficits via the automatic stabilisers the only way to get income growth going in this context and to allow the private sector surpluses to build was to increase the deficits beyond the impact of the automatic stabilisers the reality is that this policy change hasn t delivered large enough fiscal deficits even with external deficits narrowing the result has been large negative income adjustments which brought the sectoral balances into equality at significantly lower levels of economic activity the following blogs may be of further interest to you question 2 the debt of a government which issues its own currency and floats it in international markets is not really a liability because the government can just continuously roll it over without ever having to pay it back this is different to a household the user of the currency which not only has to service its debt but also has to repay them at the due date the answer is false first households do have to service their debts and repay them at some due date or risk default the other crucial point is that households also have to forego some current consumption use up savings or run down assets to service their debts and ultimately repay them second a sovereign government also has to service their debts and repay them at some due date or risk default no different there but unlike a household it does not have to forego any current spending capacity or privatise public assets to accomplish these financial transactions but the public debt is a legal obligation on government and so is totally a liability now can it just roll it over continuously well the question was subtle because the government can always keep issuing new debt when the old issues mature and maintain a stable or whatever but as the previous debt issued matures it is paid out as per the terms of the issue so that nuance was designed to elicit specific thinking the other point is that the liability on a sovereign government is legally like all liabilities enforceable in courts the risk associated with taking that liability on is zero which is very different to the risks attached to taking on private debt there is zero risk that a holder of a public bond instrument will not be paid principle and interest on time the other point to appreciate is that the original holder of the public debt might not be the final holder who is paid out the market for public debt is the most liquid of all debt markets and trading in public debt instruments of all nations is conducted across all markets each hour of every day while i am most familiar with the australian institutional structure the following developments are not dissimilar to the way bond issuance in primary markets is organised elsewhere you can access information about this from the australian office of financial management which is a treasury related public body that manages all public debt issuance in australia it conducts the primary market which is the institutional machinery via which the government sells debt to the non government sector in a modern monetary system with flexible exchange rates it is clear the government does not have to finance its spending so the fact that governments hang on to primary market issuance is largely ideological fear of fiscal excesses rather than an intrinsic need in this blog will we really pay higher interest rates i go into this period more fully and show that it was driven by the ideological calls for fiscal discipline and the growing influence of the credit rating agencies accordingly all net spending had to be fully placed in the private market for a purely voluntary constraint on the government and a waste of time a secondary market is where existing financial assets are traded by interested parties so the financial assets enter the monetary system via the primary market and are then available for trading in the secondary the same structure applies to private share issues for example the company raises funds via the primary issuance process then its shares are traded in secondary markets clearly secondary market trading has no impact at all on the volume of financial assets in the system it just shuffles the wealth between wealth holders in the context of public debt issuance the transactions in the primary market are vertical net financial assets are created or destroyed and the secondary market transactions are all horizontal no new financial assets are created please read my blog deficit spending 101 part 3 for more information primary issues are conducted via auction tender systems and the treasury determines the timing of these events in addition to the type and volumne of debt to be issued the issue is then be put out for tender and the market determines the final price of the bonds issued imagine a a1000 bond is offered at a coupon of 5 per cent meaning that you would get a50 dollar per annum until the bond matured at which time you would get a1000 back imagine that the market wanted a yield of 6 per cent to accommodate risk expectations see below so for them the bond is unattractive unless the price is lower than a1000 so tender system they would put in a purchase bid lower than the a1000 to ensure they get the 6 per cent return they sought the general rule for fixed income bonds is that when the prices rise the yield falls and vice versa thus the price of a bond can change in the market place according to interest rate fluctuations when interest rates rise the price of previously issued bonds fall because they are less attractive in comparison to the newly issued bonds which are offering a higher coupon rates reflecting current interest rates when interest rates fall the price of older bonds increase becoming more attractive as newly issued bonds offer a lower coupon rate than the older higher coupon rated bonds so for new bond issues the aofm receives the tenders from the bond market traders these will be ranked in terms of price and implied yields desired and a quantity requested in millions the aofm which is really just part of treasury sometimes sells some bonds to the central bank rba for their open market operations at the weighted average yield of the final tender the aofm will then issue the bonds in highest price bid order until it raises the revenue it seeks so the first bidder with the highest price lowest yield gets what they want as long as it doesn t exhaust the whole tender which is not likely then the second bidder higher yield and so on in this way if demand for the tender is low the final yields will be higher and vice versa there are a lot of myths peddled in the financial press about this rising yields may indicate a rising sense of risk mostly from future inflation although sovereign credit ratings will influence this but they may also indicated a recovering economy where people are more confidence investing in commercial paper for higher returns and so they demand less of the risk free government paper so while there is no credit risk attached to holding public debt that is the holder knows they will receive the principle and interest that is specified on the issued debt instrument there is still market risk which is related to movements in interest rates for government accounting purposes however the trading of the bonds once issued is of no consequence they still retain the liability to pay the fixed coupon rate and the face value of the bond at the time of issue not the market price the person institution that sells the bond before maturity may gain or lose relative to their original purchase price but that is totally outside of the concern of the government its liability is to pay the specified coupon rate at the time of issue and then the whole face value at the time of maturity there are complications to the primary sale process some bonds sell at discounts which imply the coupon value further there are arrangements between treasuries and central banks about the way in which public debt holdings are managed and accounted for but these nuances do not alter the initial contention public debt is a liability of the government in just the same way as private debt is a liability for those holders the following blog may be of further interest to you question 3 the fact that large scale quantitative easing conducted by central banks in japan in 2001 and now more recently in the uk and the usa has not caused inflation provides a strong refutation of the mainstream quantity theory of money which claims that growth in the stock of money will be inflationary the answer is false the question requires you to a understand the quantity theory of money and b understand the impact of quantitative easing in relation to quantity theory of money the short reason the answer is false is that quantitative easing has not increased the aggregates that drive the alleged causality in the quantity theory of money that is the various estimates of the money supply the quantity theory of money which in symbols is mv pq but means that the money stock times the turnover per period v is equal to the price level p times real output q the mainstream assume that v is fixed despite empirically it moving all over the place and q is always at full employment as a result of market adjustments yes in applying this theory they deny the existence of unemployment the more reasonable mainstream economists who probably have kids who cannot get a job at present admit that short run deviations in the predictions of the quantity theory of money can occur but in the long run all the frictions causing unemployment will disappear and the theory will apply in general the monetarists the most recent group to revive the quantity theory of money claim that with v and q fixed then changes in m cause changes in p which is the basic monetarist claim that expanding the money supply is inflationary they say that excess monetary growth creates a situation where too much money is chasing too few goods and the only adjustment that is possible is nominal that is inflation one of the contributions of keynes was to show the quantity theory of money could not be correct he observed price level changes independent of monetary supply movements and vice versa which changed his own perception of the way the monetary system operated further with high rates of capacity and labour underutilisation at various times including now one can hardly seriously maintain the view that q is fixed there is always scope for real adjustments that is increasing output to match nominal growth in aggregate demand so if increased credit became available and borrowers used the deposits that were created by the loans to purchase goods and services it is likely that firms with excess capacity will re the mainstream have related the current non standard monetary policy efforts the so called quantitative easing to the quantity theory of money and predicted hyperinflation will arise so it is the modern belief in the quantity theory of money is behind the hysteria about the level of bank reserves at present it has to be inflationary they say because there is all this money lying around and it will flood the economy textbook like that of mankiw mislead their students into thinking that there is a direct relationship between the monetary base and the money supply they claim that the central bank controls the money supply by buying and selling government bonds in open market operations and that the private banks then create multiples of the base via credit creation students are familiar with the pages of textbook space wasted on explaining the erroneous concept of the money multiplier where a banks are alleged to loan out some of its reserves and create money as i have indicated several times the depiction of the fractional reserve money multiplier process in textbooks like mankiw exemplifies the mainstream misunderstanding of banking operations please read my blog money multiplier and other myths for more discussion on this point the idea that the monetary base the sum of bank reserves and currency leads to a change in the money supply via some multiple is not a valid representation of the way the monetary system operates even though it appears in all mainstream macroeconomics textbooks and is relentlessly rammed down the throats of unsuspecting economic students the money multiplier myth leads students to think that as the central bank can control the monetary base then it can control the money supply further given that inflation is allegedly the result of the money supply growing too fast then the blame is sheeted home to the government the central bank in this case the reality is that the central bank does not have the capacity to control the money supply we have regularly traversed this point in the world we live in bank loans create deposits and are made without reference to the reserve positions of the banks the bank then ensures its reserve positions are legally compliant as a separate process knowing that it can always get the reserves from the central bank the only way that the central bank can influence credit creation in this setting is via the price of the reserves it provides on demand to the commercial banks so when we talk about quantitative easing we must first understand that it requires the short term interest rate to be at zero or close to it otherwise the central bank would not be able to maintain control of a positive interest rate target because the excess reserves would invoke a competitive process in the interbank market which would effectively drive the interest rate down quantitative easing then involves the central bank buying assets from the private sector government bonds and high quality corporate debt so what the central bank is doing is swapping financial assets with the banks they sell their financial assets and receive back in return extra reserves so the central bank is buying one type of financial asset private holdings of bonds company paper and exchanging it for another reserve balances at the central bank the net financial assets in the private sector are in fact unchanged although the portfolio composition of those assets is altered maturity substitution which changes yields and returns in terms of changing portfolio compositions quantitative easing increases central bank demand for long maturity assets held in the private sector which reduces interest rates at the longer end of the yield curve these are traditionally thought of as the investment rates this might increase aggregate demand given the cost of investment funds is likely to drop but on the other hand the lower rates reduce the interest income of savers who will reduce consumption demand accordingly how these opposing effects balance out is unclear but the evidence suggests there is not very much impact at all for the monetary aggregates outside of base money to increase the banks would then have to increase their lending and create deposits this is at the heart of the mainstream belief is that quantitative easing will stimulate the economy sufficiently to put a brake on the downward spiral of lost production and the increasing unemployment the recent experience and that of japan in 2001 showed that quantitative easing does not succeed in doing this should we be surprised definitely not the mainstream view is based on the erroneous belief that the banks need reserves before they can lend and that quantitative easing provides those reserves that is a major misrepresentation of the way the banking system actually operates but the mainstream position asserts wrongly that banks only lend if they have prior reserves the illusion is that a bank is an institution that accepts deposits to build up reserves and then on lends them at a margin to make money the conceptualisation suggests that if it doesn t have adequate reserves then it cannot lend so the presupposition is that by adding to bank reserves quantitative easing will help lending but banks do not operate like this bank lending is not reserve constrained banks lend to any credit worthy customer they can find and then worry about their reserve positions afterwards if they are short of reserves their reserve accounts have to be in positive balance each day and in some countries central banks require certain ratios to be maintained then they borrow from each other in the interbank market or ultimately they will borrow from the central bank through the so called discount window they are reluctant to use the latter facility because it carries a penalty higher interest cost the point is that building bank reserves will not increase the bank s capacity to lend loans create deposits which generate reserves the reason that the commercial banks are currently not lending much is because they are not convinced there are credit worthy customers on their doorstep in the current climate the assessment of what is credit worthy has become very strict compared to the lax days as the top of the boom approached those that claim that quantitative easing will expose the economy to uncontrollable inflation are just harking back to the old and flawed quantity theory of money this theory has no application in a modern monetary economy and proponents of it have to explain why economies with huge excess capacity to produce idle capital and high proportions of unused labour cannot expand production when the orders for goods and services increase should quantitative easing actually stimulate spending then the depressed economies will likely respond by increasing output not prices so the fact that large scale quantitative easing conducted by central banks in japan in 2001 and now in the uk and the usa has not caused inflation does not provide a strong refutation of the mainstream quantity theory of money because it has not impacted on the monetary aggregates the fact that is hasn t is not surprising if you understand how the monetary system operates but it has certainly bedazzled the easily dazzled mainstream economists the following blogs may be of further interest to you that is enough for today c

rest of the market a strong rebound in hiring which eased worries that the u s economy is slowing too sharply helped put traders in a buying mood the jobs report also hit a happy medium for markets strategists said it was neither low enough to heighten recession worries nor high enough to prod the federal reserve to raise interest rates the big driver now over the next few weeks will be earnings

friday traders drew encouragement from the government s latest monthly tally of hiring the labor department said that u s employers added 196 000 jobs last month more than economists had forecast the

average hourly earnings rose 3 2 percent in march from a year earlier which was weaker than economists forecasts markets pay close attention to the numbers because while higher wages help workers afford to buy more things they also crimp corporate profit margins profitability is one of the market s top concerns as companies line up to begin reporting their first quarter results next week analysts expect companies in the s p 500 to report a nearly 4 percent drop in earnings per share from a year earlier which would be the first decline since the spring of 2016 the expected drop in

tighter financial market conditions at the turn of the year left job growth below 2018 s brisk pace the labor department s closely watched employment report on friday also showed a small upward revision to february s meager job gains this was a goldilocks report with a rebound in job growth to calm fears of an imminent recession and wage growth that was solid enough without triggering inflationary concerns said curt long chief economist at the national association of federally insured credit unions the fed will be pleased as it supports their present stance of holding firm on rates

september 2017 the economy has shifted into lower gear as stimulus from the trump administration s 1 5 trillion tax cut package as well as increased government spending fades a trade war between washington and beijing and slowing global growth have also taken a toll on the economy which in july will celebrate 10 years of expansion the longest on record president donald trump has boasted about the economy especially the labor market as being one of the big wins of his first term in office sluggish growth if it persists could pose a challenge to trump s re election hopes next year trump who has blamed the fed s relatively tighter monetary policy for the slowdown in economic activity on friday urged the central bank to cut interest rates i think they should drop rates trump told reporters i think they really slowed us down economists polled by reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 180 000 jobs last month the pickup in job growth helped to boost u s stocks the dollar rose marginally against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices were mixed the employment report added to fairly upbeat construction spending and factory data that led wall street banks to boost

have moderated to an average of 180 000 this year from 223 000 in 2018 they remain above the roughly 100 000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working age population economists expect job growth to average about 150 000 per month this year there are about 7 58 million open jobs in the economy vacancies could remain elevated as 224 000 people dropped out of the labor force last month

perhaps many were those investors who had thought that q4 2018 was the beginning of the next big recession well following the end of q1 2019 that seems to have been put on hold for a while with investors optimism lifting the broader fixed income front into strong single digit gains while most equity asset classes locking in double digit advancements unwise were those investors who have panicked and opted to peter out at the bottom of the market correction last december on the contrary those who were brave enough to either hold or tap into the investible market against the downward trajectory which had gained quite a momentum at the time must be quite pleased with the results witnessed over the three months that followed let me recall briefly what exactly brought about the daunting market scenario of last year the ongoing trade dispute and negotiations between the world s two largest economies the us and china hawkish tone or at least less dovish tone by the us federal reserve and the european central bank and brexit all in the context of weaker global growth expectations as highlighted by various renowned international bodies such as the international monetary fund imf in fact much of the positivity across most asset classes since the beginning of the year is a kind of knee jerk reaction by financial markets expecting the us federal reserve not to raise interest rates further anytime soon which was mirrored in europe with mario draghi ecb s president adopting a more dovish tone too both jerome h powell and draghi have revised gdp growth expectations further down to 2 1 per cent and 1 1 per cent respectively one should also not exclude the possibility that the sharp decline across the us equity market itself in the previous quarter acted as a deterring factor to the us administration from hiking tariffs on china over the quarter any further this combined with the march 29 brexit deadline not being the actual deadline at all are more or less the main contributing factors that buoyed the broader market throughout the entire quarter nevertheless interpreting how markets are going to react is never an easy task this will prove to be even tougher going forward if one had to dig deeper and look into various economic data as highlighted hereunder and which factors will have the highest weight in determining whether markets will be heading north or south over the months ahead the coming 18 months will be critical in determining the possibility of donald trump being re elected as us president on one side some factors are at the discretion of trump s administration namely the stance he intends to adopt in trying to solve the trade dispute with china on the other hand whether the us fed maintains the dovish tone markets are currently pricing in with the possibility of a rate cut is not entirely in control of the us president i would not exclude a scenario where trump exacerbates pressure on jeremy powell chairman of the federal reserve should the fed decisions not please him completely as we have already witnessed few months ago the coming 18 months will be critical in determining the possibility of donald trump being re elected data suggests as highlighted by an article in the financial times a few weeks ago that there is an extraordinary strong correlation between an incumbent president s win possibility and household economic confidence thus maintaining consumer sentiment at high levels whatever it takes will probably be top on trump s agenda however one may rightly ask why should markets react the way they have reacted positively if markets are indeed expecting a potential rate cut experiencing yet again an inverted us treasury yield curve late last month where yields on longer dated bonds are lower than those of shorter dated debt views among different market participants and economists may defer one plausibility could be that this is a reflection of the fact that the fed has for now refrained from raising interest rates further and potentially the eventual next move in rates could be down but when to expect it is perhaps more of a rhetorical question one should remember that markets tend to always price or at least try to future expectations and apart from growth expectations which may have been subdued over the past year interest rates themselves play a crucial role in determining the present value of future expected value therefore by implication lower interest rates push equity prices and bonds present value of future cash flows which are inversely related to rates higher and yes it does resonate with most of the 10 year bull market since the 2008 global financial crisis with an extended period of low interest rates and quantitative easing fuelling most of the bull market making reference to one other important economic figure inflation rate in the us has stood below the two per cent fed target for most of the last decade however last february a number of key officials from the fed brought about arguments in favour of changing the way the federal reserve responds to inflation rather than going for a tightening approach as soon as inflation rate hits the two per cent target the benefits of accepting overshoots to the two per cent goal were highlighted making up for times where inflation was too low such a consideration would portray an even rosier picture for the broader market from an interest rate perspective in europe the economic scenario seems to be even more bleak particularly when looking at the manufacturing side an economic health indicator frequently referred to the manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi indicates the sharpest contraction in factory activity in six years with manufacturing in germany falling at the fastest pace since mid 2012 on a more positive note the services side of the economy remains rather resilient with services pmi still in expansion territory and strongest in the past four months unemployment rate remained steady at 7 8 per cent whereas inflation figures hovered lower to 1 4 per cent once you weigh in all the uncertainty surrounding the euro area and adding to it the change in rhetoric by the ecb president in march to an even more accommodative one as well as a less disruptive trade policy environment these have all in all left a positive impact on the broader market continued backing by central banks a trade deal being reached between washington and beijing together with a soft brexit scenario could act as further support to markets throughout the second quarter however to what extent the manufacturing slowdown particularly in europe could have an impact on both business and consumer confidence makes it ever important for an investor to ensure proper

your inbox as soon as they are published on june 30 2016 an auto parts magnate received the kind of news anyone would dread the internal revenue service had determined he had engaged in abusive tax maneuvers he stood accused of masking about 5 billion in income the irs wanted over 1 2 billion in back taxes and penalties the magnate georg schaeffler was the billionaire scion of a family owned german manufacturer and was quietly working as a corporate lawyer in dallas schaeffler had extra reason to fear the irs it seemed he wasn t in the sights of just any division of the agency but the equivalent of its seal team 6 in 2009 the irs had formed a crack team of specialists to unravel the tax dodges of the ultrawealthy in an age of widening inequality with a concentration of wealth not seen since the gilded age the rich were evading taxes through ever more sophisticated maneuvers the irs commissioner aimed to stanch the country s losses with what he proclaimed would be a game changing strategy in short order charles rettig then a high powered tax lawyer and today president donald trump s irs commissioner warned that the squad was conducting the audits from hell if trump were being audited rettig wrote during the presidential campaign this is the elite team that would do it georg schaeffler faced a 1 2 billion tax bill after his company restructured a huge debt julian stratenschulte picture alliance via getty images the wealth team embarked on a contentious audit of schaeffler in 2012 eventually determining that he owed about 1 2 billion in unpaid taxes and penalties but after seven years of grinding bureaucratic combat the irs abandoned its campaign the agency informed schaeffler s lawyers it was willing to accept just tens of millions according to a person familiar with the audit how did a case that consumed so many years of effort with a team of its finest experts working on a signature mission produce such a piddling result for the irs the schaeffler case offers a rare window into just how challenging it is to take on the ultrawealthy for starters they can devote seemingly limitless resources to hiring the best legal and accounting talent such taxpayers tend not to steamroll tax laws they employ complex highly refined strategies that seek to stretch the tax code to their advantage it can take years for irs investigators just to understand a transaction and deem it to be a violation once that happens the irs team has to contend with battalions of high priced lawyers and accountants that often outnumber and outgun even the agency s elite swat team we are nowhere near a circumstance where the irs could launch the types of audits we need to tackle sophisticated taxpayers in a complicated world said steven rosenthal who used to represent wealthy taxpayers and is now a senior fellow at the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and brookings institution because the audits are private irs officials can go to prison if they divulge taxpayer information details of the often epic paper battles between the rich and the tax collectors are sparse with little in the public record attorneys are also loath to talk about their clients taxes and most wealthy people strive to keep their financial affairs under wraps such disputes almost always settle out of court have you been involved in a global high wealth audit if so we d like to hear about your experiences email or on signal at 718 496 5233 but propublica was able to reconstruct the key points in the schaeffler case the billionaire s lawyers and accountants first crafted a transaction of unusual complexity one so novel that they acknowledged even as they planned it that it was likely to be challenged by the irs then schaeffler deployed teams of professionals to battle the irs on multiple fronts they denied that he owed any money arguing the agency fundamentally misunderstood the tax issues schaeffler s representatives complained to top officials at the agency they challenged document requests in court at various times irs auditors felt schaeffler s side was purposely stalling but in the end schaeffler s team emerged almost completely victorious his experience was telling the irs new approach to taking on the superwealthy has been stymied the wealthy s lobbyists immediately pushed to defang the new team and soon after the group was formed republicans in congress began slashing the agency s budget as a result the team didn t receive the resources it was promised thousands of irs employees left from every corner of the agency especially ones with expertise in complex audits the kinds of specialists the agency hoped would staff the new elite unit the agency had planned to assign 242 examiners to the group by 2012 according to a report by the irs inspector general but by 2014 it had only 96 auditors by last year the number had fallen to 58 the wealth squad never came close to having the impact its proponents envisaged as robert gardner a 39 year veteran of the irs who often interacted with the team as a top official at the agency s tax whistleblower office put it from the minute it went live it was dead on arrival most people picture irs officials as all knowing and fearsome but when it comes to understanding how the superwealthy move their money around irs auditors historically have been more like high school physics teachers trying to operate the large hadron collider charles rettig commissioner of the internal revenue service said if any group were auditing donald trump it would be the global high wealth team aaron p bernstein getty images that began to change in the early 2000s after congress and the agency uncovered widespread use of abusive tax shelters by the rich the discovery led to criminal charges and settlements by major accounting firms by the end of the decade the irs had determined that millions of americans had secret bank accounts abroad the agency managed to crack open switzerland s banking secrecy and it recouped billions in lost tax revenue the irs came to realize it was not properly auditing the ultrawealthy multimillionaires frequently don t have easily visible income they often have trusts foundations limited liability companies complex partnerships and overseas operations all woven together to lower their tax bills when irs auditors examined their finances they typically looked narrowly they might scrutinize just one return for one entity and examine say a year s gifts or income belatedly attempting to confront improper tax avoidance the irs formed what was officially called the global high wealth industry group in 2009 the genesis was if you think of an incredibly wealthy family their web of entities somehow gives them a remarkably low effective tax rate said former irs commissioner steven miller who was one of those responsible for creating the wealth squad we hadn t really been looking at it all together and shame on us the irs located the group within the division that audits the biggest companies in recognition of the fact that the finances of the 1 percent resemble those of multinational corporations more than those of the average rich person former irs commissioner steven miller tried to fix the agency s approach to auditing the ultrawealthy nicholas kamm afp getty images the vision was clear as doug shulman a george w bush appointee who remained to helm the agency under the obama administration explained in a 2009 speech we want to better understand the entire economic picture of the enterprise controlled by the wealthy individual it s particularly important to audit the wealthy well and not simply because that s where the money is that s where the cheating is too studies show that the wealthiest are more likely to avoid paying taxes the top 0 5 percent in income account for fully a fifth of all the underreported income according to a 2010 study by the irs andrew johns and the university of michigan s joel slemrod adjusted for inflation that s more than 50 billion each year in unpaid taxes the plans for the wealth squad seemed like a step forward in a few years the group would be staffed with several hundred auditors a team of examiners would tackle each audit not just one or two agents as was more typical in the past the new group would draw from the irs best of the best that was crucial because irs auditors have a long standing reputation at least among the practitioners who represent deep pocketed taxpayers as hapless and overmatched the agents can fritter away years tax lawyers say auditing transactions they don t grasp in private practice we played whack a mole said rosenthal of the tax policy center the irs felt a transaction was suspect but couldn t figure out why so it would raise an issue and we d whack it and they would raise another and we d whack it the irs was ill equipped the global high wealth group was supposed to change that indeed with all the fanfare at the outset tax practitioners began to worry on behalf of their clientele the impression was it was all going to be specialists in fields highly trained the irs would assemble teams with the exact right expertise to target these issues chicago based tax attorney jenny johnson said the new group s first moves spurred resistance the team sent wide ranging requests for information seeking details about their targets entire empires taxpayers with more than 10 million in income or assets received a dozen pages of initial requests with the promise of many more to follow the agency sought years of details on every entity it could tie to the subject of the audits in past audits that initial overture had been limited to one or two pages with narrowly tailored requests here a typical request sought information on a vast array of issues one example a list of any u s or foreign entity in which the taxpayer held an at least a 20 percent interest including any hybrid instruments that could be turned into a 20 percent or more ownership share the taxpayer would then have to identify each and every current and former officer trustee and manager from the entity s inception get our top investigations subscribe to the big story newsletter taxpayers who received such requests recoiled attacking the core idea that shulman had said would animate the audits their attorneys and accountants argued the examinations sought too much information creating an onerous burden the audits proceeded into a proctology exam unearthing every aspect of their lives said mark allison a prominent tax attorney for caplin drysdale who has represented taxpayers undergoing global high wealth audits it was extraordinarily intrusive not surprisingly these people tend to be private and are not used to sharing tax practitioners took their concerns directly to the agency at american bar association conferences and during the aba s regular private meetings with top irs officials part of our approach was to have private sit downs to raise issues and concerns said allison who has served in top roles in the aba s tax division for years we were telling them this was too much unwieldy and therefore unfair allison said he told high ranking irs officials you need to rein in these audit teams for years politicians have hammered the irs for its supposed abuse of taxpayers congress created a taxpayer bill of rights in the mid 1990s today the irs often refers to its work as customer service one result of constant congressional scrutiny is that senior irs officials are willing to meet with top tax lawyers and address their concerns there was help there they stuck their necks out for me allison said the irs publicly retreated speaking at a washington d c bar association event in february 2013 a top irs official james fee conceded the demands were too detailed and long telling the gathering that the agency has taken strides to make sure it doesn t happen again the global high wealth group began to limit its initial document requests the lobbying campaign combined with the lack of funding for the group took its toll one report estimated that the wealth team had audited only around a dozen wealthy taxpayers in its first two and a half years in a september 2015 report the irs inspector general said the agency had failed to establish the team as a standalone group capable of conducting all of its own examinations the group didn t have steady leadership with three directors in its first five years when it did audit the ultrawealthy more than 40 percent of the reviews resulted in no additional taxes loading the inspector general also criticized the irs broadly not just its high wealth team for not focusing enough on the richest taxpayers in 2010 the irs as a whole audited over 32 000 millionaires by 2018 that number had fallen to just over 16 000 according to data compiled by syracuse university audits of the wealthiest americans have collapsed 52 percent since 2011 falling more substantially than audits of the middle class and the poor almost half of audits of the wealthy were of taxpayers making 200 000 to 399 000 those audits brought in 605 per audit hour worked exams of those making over 5 million by contrast brought in more than 4 500 an hour the irs didn t even have the resources to pursue millionaires who had been hit with a hefty tax bill and simply stiffed uncle sam it appeared to no longer emphasize the collection of delinquent accounts of global high wealth taxpayers a 2017 inspector general report said in recent years the number of global high wealth audits has been higher it closed 149 audits in the last year but tax lawyers and former irs officials say even that improvement is deceptive a major reason is that the audits are much less ambitious they were longer at the beginning and shorter as the process moved on johnson the tax attorney said inside the irs agents seethed the whole organization was very frustrated gardner said they were just really not sure what the hell their mission was what they were supposed to be accomplishing georg schaeffler 54 has flowing salt and pepper hair that makes him look like he could ve been an actor on the 1980s tv show dynasty the impression is offset by the wire rim glasses he wears and by the bookish disposition of a person who as a teenager once asked for a copy of the german constitution as a present as a younger man schaeffler tried to escape his legacy he left germany and the family company at a young age and lit out for the american west he was trying to make it on his own where people don t know who you are as he would tell a reporter for a magazine profile years later some might escape to texas to live a bit wild schaeffler became a corporate lawyer schaeffler s law firm colleagues didn t know much more than that he spoke with an accent and certainly not that he was vastly wealthy that is until he landed on the forbes list of global billionaires rueful at the loss of his privacy schaeffler once declared i hate forbes the family s riches stemmed from ball bearings and other automobile parts manufactured by the schaeffler group which was founded by schaeffler s father and then passed to his mother after his father died by 2006 georg pronounced gay org owned 80 percent of the enterprise and his mother the remaining 20 percent as a texas resident at that time schaeffler was required to pay u s income taxes he very nearly lost it all in 2008 schaeffler group made a big mistake it offered to buy continental ag a tiremaker just days before the stock and credit markets experienced their worst crisis since the great depression even as continental s stock price crashed schaeffler was legally obligated to go through with its purchase at the much higher pre crash price schaeffler and his mother maria elisabeth ran into trouble after their family auto parts company acquired tiremaker continental ag in the middle of the financial crisis julian stratenschulte picture alliance via getty images schaeffler group flirted with bankruptcy and pleaded for aid from the german government the media began to pay closer attention to the private company and the low profile family that ran it german press accounts dismissed schaeffler s mother as the billionaire beggar for seeking a bailout and pilloried her for wearing a fur coat at a ski race while seeking government help no german government aid came the schaeffler group teetered and the family s fortune plummeted from 9 billion to almost zero amid the crisis over continental georg accepted his fate and took up a more prominent role at the company he s now the chairman of its supervisory board to pay for continental schaeffler group borrowed about 11 billion euros from a consortium of banks at the time schaeffler s lenders including royal bank of scotland were desperate too having suffered enormous losses on home mortgages they wanted to avoid any more write downs that might result if the company defaulted on the loans so in 2009 and 2010 schaeffler s lenders restructured the debt in a devilishly complex series of transactions by 2012 these maneuvers had caught the eye of the global high wealth group paul doerr an experienced revenue agent would head the audit eventually the irs discerned what it came to believe was the transaction s essence the banks had effectively forgiven nearly half of schaeffler s debt to the irs that had significant tax implications in the wealth team s view georg schaeffler had received billions of dollars of income on which he owed taxes the auditors view reflects a core aspect of the u s tax system under american law companies and individuals are liable for taxes on the forgiven portion of any loan this frequently comes up in the housing market a homeowner borrows 100 000 from a bank to buy a house prices fall and the homeowner under financial duress unloads it for 80 000 if the bank forgives the 20 000 still owed on the original mortgage the owner pays taxes on that amount as if it were ordinary income this levy can seem unfair since it often hits borrowers who have run into trouble paying back their debts the problem was particularly acute during the housing crisis so in late 2007 congress passed a bill that protected most homeowners from being hit with a tax bill after foreclosure or otherwise getting a principal reduction from their lender tax experts say the principle of taxing forgiven loans is crucial to preventing chicanery without it people could arrange with their employers to borrow their salaries through the entire year interest free and then have the employer forgive the loan at the very end voila no taxable income the notion that forgiven debt is taxable applies to corporate transactions too that means concern about such a tax bill is rarely far from a distressed corporate debtor s mind any time you have a troubled situation it s a typical tax issue you have to address and the banks certainly understand it too said les samuels an attorney who spent decades advising corporations and wealthy individuals on tax matters but the efforts to avoid tax in the case of schaeffler and his lenders took a particularly convoluted form it involved several different instruments each with multiple moving parts the refinancing was complicated and unusual said samuels who was not involved in the transaction if you were sitting in the government s chair and reading press reports on the situation your reaction might be that the company was on the verge of being insolvent and when the refinancing was completed the government might think that banks didn t know whether they would be repaid this account of the audit was drawn from conversations with people familiar with it who were not authorized to speak on the record as well as court and german securities filings the irs declined to comment for this story doerr did not respond to repeated calls and emails a spokesman for schaeffler declined to make him available for an interview mr schaeffler always strives to comply with the complex u s tax code the spokesman wrote in a statement saying the fact that the refinancing was with six independent international banks in itself demonstrates that these were arm s length commercially driven transactions the irs professionally concluded the audit in 2018 without making adjustments to those transactions and there is no continuing dispute either administratively or in litigation related to these matters schaeffler s lenders never explicitly canceled the loan the banks and schaeffler maintained to the irs that the loan was real and no debt had been forgiven the irs came not to buy that after years of trying to unravel the refinancing the irs homed in on what the agency contended was a disguise the banks and schaeffler had a mutual interest in maintaining the appearance that the debt hadn t gone away a person familiar with the transaction said but the irs believed the debt had in fact been canceled in the refinancing the banks and schaeffler had agreed to split the company s debt which had grown to 12 billion euros at that point into two pieces a senior loan to be paid back first worth about 7 billion euros and a junior piece worth about 5 billion euros schaeffler s income producing assets were placed into the entity that held the senior debt schaeffler was required to repay the debt according to a schedule and to pay a meaningful interest rate 4 25 percentage points above the rate his lenders charge each other to borrow money in short it appeared to be a relatively straightforward debt transaction the junior debt was another matter and its provisions would raise the hackles of the irs to begin with the entity that held the junior debt did not directly hold income producing assets there was no schedule of payments that schaeffler had to make on the junior debt he wasn t obligated to make principal payments until the end of the loan s term and it carried a nearly nonexistent annual interest rate of 0 1 percentage points above prevailing interbank lending rates plus an additional 7 percent per year which schaeffler could choose to defer and pay at the end of the term the banks attached two other provisions to the refinancing a contingent remuneration payment and a contingent upside instrument according to german securities filings the two additions called for schaeffler to make payments to the future performance of the company the irs and schaeffler s team fought especially over the contingent upside instrument its value was tied to the schaeffler group s future profitability just like a share of stock would be the irs argued that not only was this an equitylike sweetener to the banks but that it tainted the entire junior portion of the debt to the irs it looked like the banks had a claim on future payments from schaeffler but they didn t know when they d receive it or even if they would ever get anything to the irs these steps all added up to the effective cancellation of about 5 billion worth of debt for which the banks had received something in return that something looked and acted very much like equity the schaeffler audit was one of the biggest for the global high wealth group the irs assigned a larger than normal team to the exam the agency would send 86 separate document requests to schaeffler through july 2013 but there were problems almost from the beginning according to people familiar with the audit who provided this account and chronology the irs examiners disagreed with one another over strategy the debates sometimes spilled into the view of schaeffler s team i remember a tremendous amount of turnover from the exam team and infighting they were not presenting a coherent message a person in the schaeffler camp said by contrast schaeffler s team of lawyers and accountants was large and unified these taxpayers aren t exactly represented by h r block gardner the retired irs official said schaeffler s advisers threw as much as they could back at the agency document requests are typically voluntary at the outset but at one point an irs auditor was frustrated at what the team saw as the schaeffler team s resistance and delays and demanded would a summons help according to a person familiar with the exam schaeffler s team complained about the perceived threat the irs scolded its employee and doerr the lead auditor apologized to the schaeffler side according to the person the irs efforts to police the superwealthy have been a bust michael brochstein sopa images lightrocket via getty images in another instance the irs could not get information it sought from ernst young the accounting firm related to its advice to schaeffler so it sued the accounting firm in early 2014 ernst young contended the material was privileged because it was prepared in anticipation of litigation the irs won in the u s district court for the southern district of new york but ernst young appealed in early november 2015 with the ernst young appeal unresolved top irs officials gave the schaeffler audit team the permission it was looking for they allowed the auditors to notify schaeffler that they believed he d failed to disclose about 5 billion in income and that he could expect a 1 2 billion tax bill that included some 200 million in penalties because the agency viewed the transaction as abusive only days later the irs was dealt a defeat that would further hamstring its ability to press its case on nov 10 the 2nd u s circuit court of appeals reversed the district judge slapping down the irs efforts to get the ernst young documents ruling they were in fact protected by privilege the irs had no choice it would have to proceed without the documents the irs took solace that despite the adverse ruling on the documents the appeals court appeared to bolster the irs view of the transaction describing it as a complex and novel refinancing the court said the consortium of banks essentially insured schaeffler by extending credit and subordinating its debt the opinion found that schaeffler s team had known that litigation over the transaction was virtually inevitable underscoring the sense that the billionaire s lawyers and accountants knew they were pushing legal limits the two sides wrangled even over routine procedural matters the statute of limitations was about to run out usually the taxpayer voluntarily agrees to extend the time limit rather than antagonize the agents doing an audit but schaeffler s team raised the prospect of refusing an extension they ultimately relented but succeeded in amping up the pressure on the auditors even as the antagonism built between the two sides the irs showed deference to the schaeffler camp doerr gave schaeffler s attorneys a heads up that the agency was going to deliver bad news an action that was viewed as overly solicitous according to one person it gave an opening for schaeffler s lawyers to raise their concerns with the audit team s bosses they expressed how wrongheaded they thought the irs position was and how inappropriate its actions had been in june 2016 the irs sent schaeffler the official notice that the agency would seek unpaid tax and penalties schaeffler s attorneys continued to argue often above the heads of the audit team that the auditors interpretation was incorrect they held conference calls with top irs officials saying the audit team had given the schaeffler side mixed messages some on the team had assured schaeffler s attorneys that he would not face a large tax bill or be subject to a penalty top officials then met with the global high wealth team to discuss the issues the pushback is incredible one knowledgeable person recalled the pushback worked and here s where an audit is radically different from a court case court cases are typically accompanied by publicly available decisions and rulings that explain them in detail by contrast audits are shielded by the secrecy of the irs process they can end with no scrap of publicly available paper to memorialize key decisions in august 2016 in schaeffler s case officials several rungs up the irs hierarchy told the global high wealth team to withdraw the penalty from its request even without a penalty portion schaeffler would still owe the original 1 billion in taxes if the irs maintained its contention that the banks had cancelled his debt schaeffler s team then went to work on that too it succeeded by 2017 the irs had abandoned its assertion that debt had been transformed into equity after six years on a hard fought case the agency had effectively given up the irs had a few stray quibbles so the agency said it required a payment in the tens of millions according to two people familiar with the audit there the trail goes dark tax experts say schaeffler s team would likely have appealed even that offer which in many instances leads to further reductions in money owed but propublica could not ascertain that that occurred thanks in part to the u s government s bailout of the auto industry and the global economic recovery the schaeffler group s business rebounded despite a recent dip in the car market things have turned out ok for georg schaeffler today forbes estimates his fortune at over 13 billion

ten years ago the tax agency formed a special team to unravel the complex tax lowering strategies of the nation s wealthiest people but with big money and congress arrayed against the team it never had a chance by jesse eisinger and paul kiel on june 30 2016 an auto parts magnate received the kind of news anyone would dread the internal revenue service had determined he had engaged in abusive tax maneuvers he stood accused of masking about 5 billion in income the irs wanted over 1 2 billion in back taxes and penalties the magnate georg schaeffler was the billionaire scion of a family owned german manufacturer and was quietly working as a corporate lawyer in dallas schaeffler had extra reason to fear the irs it seemed he wasn t in the sights of just any division of the agency but the equivalent of its seal team 6 in 2009 the irs had formed a crack team of specialists to unravel the tax dodges of the ultrawealthy in an age of widening inequality with a concentration of wealth not seen since the gilded age the rich were evading taxes through ever more sophisticated maneuvers the irs commissioner aimed to stanch the country s losses with what he proclaimed would be a game changing strategy in short order charles rettig then a high powered tax lawyer and today president donald trump s irs commissioner warned that the squad was conducting the audits from hell if trump were being audited rettig wrote during the presidential campaign this is the elite team that would do it the wealth team embarked on a contentious audit of schaeffler in 2012 eventually determining that he owed about 1 2 billion in unpaid taxes and penalties but after seven years of grinding bureaucratic combat the irs abandoned its campaign the agency informed schaeffler s lawyers it was willing to accept just tens of millions according to a person familiar with the audit how did a case that consumed so many years of effort with a team of its finest experts working on a signature mission produce such a piddling result for the irs the schaeffler case offers a rare window into just how challenging it is to take on the ultrawealthy for starters they can devote seemingly limitless resources to hiring the best legal and accounting talent such taxpayers tend not to steamroll tax laws they employ complex highly refined strategies that seek to stretch the tax code to their advantage it can take years for irs investigators just to understand a transaction and deem it to be a violation once that happens the irs team has to contend with battalions of high priced lawyers and accountants that often outnumber and outgun even the agency s elite swat team we are nowhere near a circumstance where the irs could launch the types of audits we need to tackle sophisticated taxpayers in a complicated world said steven rosenthal who used to represent wealthy taxpayers and is now a senior fellow at the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and brookings institution because the audits are private irs officials can go to prison if they divulge taxpayer information details of the often epic paper battles between the rich and the tax collectors are sparse with little in the public record attorneys are also loath to talk about their clients taxes and most wealthy people strive to keep their financial affairs under wraps such disputes almost always settle out of court but propublica was able to reconstruct the key points in the schaeffler case the billionaire s lawyers and accountants first crafted a transaction of unusual complexity one so novel that they acknowledged even as they planned it that it was likely to be challenged by the irs then schaeffler deployed teams of professionals to battle the irs on multiple fronts they denied that he owed any money arguing the agency fundamentally misunderstood the tax issues schaeffler s representatives complained to top officials at the agency they challenged document requests in court at various times irs auditors felt schaeffler s side was purposely stalling but in the end schaeffler s team emerged almost completely victorious his experience was telling the irs new approach to taking on the superwealthy has been stymied the wealthy s lobbyists immediately pushed to defang the new team and soon after the group was formed republicans in congress began slashing the agency s budget as a result the team didn t receive the resources it was promised thousands of irs employees left from every corner of the agency especially ones with expertise in complex audits the kinds of specialists the agency hoped would staff the new elite unit the agency had planned to assign 242 examiners to the group by 2012 according to a report by the irs inspector general but by 2014 it had only 96 auditors by last year the number had fallen to 58 the wealth squad never came close to having the impact its proponents envisaged as robert gardner a 39 year veteran of the irs who often interacted with the team as a top official at the agency s tax whistleblower office put it from the minute it went live it was dead on arrival most people picture irs officials as all knowing and fearsome but when it comes to understanding how the superwealthy move their money around irs auditors historically have been more like high school physics teachers trying to operate the large hadron collider that began to change in the early 2000s after congress and the agency uncovered widespread use of abusive tax shelters by the rich the discovery led to criminal charges and settlements by major accounting firms by the end of the decade the irs had determined that millions of americans had secret bank accounts abroad the agency managed to crack open switzerland s banking secrecy and it recouped billions in lost tax revenue the irs came to realize it was not properly auditing the ultrawealthy multimillionaires frequently don t have easily visible income they often have trusts foundations limited liability companies complex partnerships and overseas operations all woven together to lower their tax bills when irs auditors examined their finances they typically looked narrowly they might scrutinize just one return for one entity and examine say a year s gifts or income belatedly attempting to confront improper tax avoidance the irs formed what was officially called the global high wealth industry group in 2009 the genesis was if you think of an incredibly wealthy family their web of entities somehow gives them a remarkably low effective tax rate said former irs commissioner steven miller who was one of those responsible for creating the wealth squad we hadn t really been looking at it all together and shame on us the irs located the group within the division that audits the biggest companies in recognition of the fact that the finances of the 1 percent resemble those of multinational corporations more than those of the average rich person the vision was clear as doug shulman a george w bush appointee who remained to helm the agency under the obama administration explained in a 2009 speech we want to better understand the entire economic picture of the enterprise controlled by the wealthy individual it s particularly important to audit the wealthy well and not simply because that s where the money is that s where the cheating is too studies show that the wealthiest are more likely to avoid paying taxes the top 0 5 percent in income account for fully a fifth of all the underreported income according to a 2010 study by the irs andrew johns and the university of michigan s joel slemrod adjusted for inflation that s more than 50 billion each year in unpaid taxes the plans for the wealth squad seemed like a step forward in a few years the group would be staffed with several hundred auditors a team of examiners would tackle each audit not just one or two agents as was more typical in the past the new group would draw from the irs best of the best that was crucial because irs auditors have a long standing reputation at least among the practitioners who represent deep pocketed taxpayers as hapless and overmatched the agents can fritter away years tax lawyers say auditing transactions they don t grasp in private practice we played whack a mole said rosenthal of the tax policy center the irs felt a transaction was suspect but couldn t figure out why so it would raise an issue and we d whack it and they would raise another and we d whack it the irs was ill equipped the global high wealth group was supposed to change that indeed with all the fanfare at the outset tax practitioners began to worry on behalf of their clientele the impression was it was all going to be specialists in fields highly trained the irs would assemble teams with the exact right expertise to target these issues chicago based tax attorney jenny johnson said the new group s first moves spurred resistance the team sent wide ranging requests for information seeking details about their targets entire empires taxpayers with more than 10 million in income or assets received a dozen pages of initial requests with the promise of many more to follow the agency sought years of details on every entity it could tie to the subject of the audits in past audits that initial overture had been limited to one or two pages with narrowly tailored requests here a typical request sought information on a vast array of issues one example a list of any u s or foreign entity in which the taxpayer held an at least a 20 percent interest including any hybrid instruments that could be turned into a 20 percent or more ownership share the taxpayer would then have to identify each and every current and former officer trustee and manager from the entity s inception taxpayers who received such requests recoiled attacking the core idea that shulman had said would animate the audits their attorneys and accountants argued the examinations sought too much information creating an onerous burden the audits proceeded into a proctology exam unearthing every aspect of their lives said mark allison a prominent tax attorney for caplin drysdale who has represented taxpayers undergoing global high wealth audits it was extraordinarily intrusive not surprisingly these people tend to be private and are not used to sharing tax practitioners took their concerns directly to the agency at american bar association conferences and during the aba s regular private meetings with top irs officials part of our approach was to have private sit downs to raise issues and concerns said allison who has served in top roles in the aba s tax division for years we were telling them this was too much unwieldy and therefore unfair allison said he told high ranking irs officials you need to rein in these audit teams for years politicians have hammered the irs for its supposed abuse of taxpayers congress created a taxpayer bill of rights in the mid 1990s today the irs often refers to its work as customer service one result of constant congressional scrutiny is that senior irs officials are willing to meet with top tax lawyers and address their concerns there was help there they stuck their necks out for me allison said the irs publicly retreated speaking at a washington d c bar association event in february 2013 a top irs official james fee conceded the demands were too detailed and long telling the gathering that the agency has taken strides to make sure it doesn t happen again the global high wealth group began to limit its initial document requests the lobbying campaign combined with the lack of funding for the group took its toll one report estimated that the wealth team had audited only around a dozen wealthy taxpayers in its first two and a half years in a september 2015 report the irs inspector general said the agency had failed to establish the team as a standalone group capable of conducting all of its own examinations the group didn t have steady leadership with three directors in its first five years when it did audit the ultrawealthy more than 40 percent the reviews resulted in no additional taxes the inspector general also criticized the irs broadly not just its high wealth team for not focusing enough on the richest taxpayers in 2010 the irs as a whole audited over 32 000 millionaires by 2018 that number had fallen to just over 16 000 according to data compiled by syracuse university audits of the wealthiest americans have collapsed 52 percent since 2011 falling more substantially than audits of the middle class and the poor almost half of audits of the wealthy were of taxpayers making 200 000 to 399 000 those audits brought in 605 per audit hour worked exams of those making over 5 million by contrast brought in more than 4 500 an hour the irs didn t even have the resources to pursue millionaires who had been hit with a hefty tax bill and simply stiffed uncle sam it appeared to no longer emphasize the collection of delinquent accounts of global high wealth taxpayers a 2017 inspector general report said in recent years the number of global high wealth audits has been higher it closed 149 audits in the last year but tax lawyers and former irs officials say even that improvement is deceptive a major reason is that the audits are much less ambitious they were longer at the beginning and shorter as the process moved on johnson the tax attorney said inside the irs agents seethed the whole organization was very frustrated gardner said they were just really not sure what the hell their mission was what they were supposed to be accomplishing georg schaeffler 54 has flowing salt and pepper hair that makes him look like he could ve been an actor on the 1980s tv show dynasty the impression is offset by the wire rim glasses he wears and by the bookish disposition of a person who as a teenager once asked for a copy of the german constitution as a present as a younger man schaeffler tried to escape his legacy he left germany and the family company at a young age and lit out for the american west he was trying to make it on his own where people don t know who you are as he would tell a reporter for a magazine profile years later some might escape to texas to live a bit wild schaeffler became a corporate lawyer schaeffler s law firm colleagues didn t know much more than that he spoke with an accent and certainly not that he was vastly wealthy that is until he landed on the forbes list of global billionaires rueful at the loss of his privacy schaeffler once declared i hate forbes the family s riches stemmed from ball bearings and other automobile parts manufactured by the schaeffler group which was founded by schaeffler s father and then passed to his mother after his father died by 2006 georg pronounced gay org owned 80 percent of the enterprise and his mother the remaining 20 percent as a texas resident at that time schaeffler was required to pay u s income taxes he very nearly lost it all in 2008 schaeffler group made a big mistake it offered to buy continental ag a tiremaker just days before the stock and credit markets experienced their worst crisis since the great depression even as continental s stock price crashed schaeffler was legally obligated to go through with its purchase at the much higher pre crash price schaeffler group flirted with bankruptcy and pleaded for aid from the german government the media began to pay closer attention to the private company and the low profile family that ran it german press accounts dismissed schaeffler s mother as the billionaire beggar for seeking a bailout and pilloried her for wearing a fur coat at a ski race while seeking government help no german government aid came the schaeffler group teetered and the family s fortune plummeted from 9 billion to almost zero amid the crisis over continental georg accepted his fate and took up a more prominent role at the company he s now the chairman of its supervisory board to pay for continental schaeffler group borrowed about 11 billion euros from a consortium of banks at the time schaeffler s lenders including royal bank of scotland were desperate too having suffered enormous losses on home mortgages they wanted to avoid any more write downs that might result if the company defaulted on the loans so in 2009 and 2010 schaeffler s lenders restructured the debt in a devilishly complex series of transactions by 2012 these maneuvers had caught the eye of the global high wealth group paul doerr an experienced revenue

euros and a junior piece worth about 5 billion euros schaeffler s income producing assets were placed into the entity that held the senior debt schaeffler was required to repay the debt according to a

effective cancellation of about 5 billion worth of debt for which the banks had received something in return that something looked and acted very much like equity the schaeffler audit was one of the biggest for the global high wealth group the irs assigned a larger than normal team to the exam the agency would send 86 separate document requests to schaeffler through july 2013 but there were problems almost from the beginning according to people familiar with the audit who provided this account and chronology the irs examiners disagreed with one another over strategy the debates sometimes spilled into the view of schaeffler s team i remember a tremendous amount of turnover from the exam team and infighting they were not presenting a coherent message a person in the schaeffler camp said by contrast schaeffler s team of lawyers and accountants was large and unified these taxpayers aren t exactly represented by h r block gardner the retired irs official said schaeffler s advisers threw as much as they could back at the agency document requests are typically voluntary at the outset but at one point an irs auditor was frustrated at what the team saw as the schaeffler team s resistance and delays and demanded would a summons help according to a person familiar with the exam schaeffler s team complained about the perceived threat the irs scolded its employee and doerr the lead auditor apologized to the schaeffler side according to the person in another instance the irs could not get information it sought from ernst young the accounting firm related to its advice to schaeffler so it sued the accounting firm in early 2014 ernst young contended the material was privileged because it was prepared in anticipation of litigation the irs won in the u s district court for the southern district of new york but ernst young appealed in early november 2015 with the ernst young appeal unresolved top irs officials gave the schaeffler audit team the permission it was looking for they allowed the auditors to notify schaeffler that they believed he d failed to disclose about 5 billion in income and that he could expect a 1 2 billion tax bill that included some 200 million in penalties because the agency viewed the transaction as abusive only days later the irs was dealt a defeat that would further hamstring its ability to press its case on nov 10 the 2nd u s circuit court of appeals reversed the district judge slapping down the irs efforts to get the ernst young documents ruling they were in fact protected by privilege the irs had no choice it would have to proceed without the documents the irs took solace that despite the adverse ruling on the documents the appeals court appeared to bolster the irs view of the transaction describing it as a complex and novel refinancing the court said the consortium of banks essentially insured schaeffler by extending credit and subordinating its debt the opinion found that schaeffler s team had known that litigation over the transaction was virtually inevitable underscoring the sense that the billionaire s lawyers and accountants knew they were pushing legal limits the two sides wrangled even over routine procedural matters the statute of limitations was about to run out usually the taxpayer voluntarily agrees to extend the time limit rather than antagonize the agents doing an audit but schaeffler s team raised the prospect of refusing an extension they ultimately relented but succeeded in amping up the pressure on the auditors even as the antagonism built between the two sides the irs showed deference to the schaeffler camp doerr gave schaeffler s attorneys a heads up that the agency was going to deliver bad news an action that was viewed as overly solicitous according to one person it gave an opening for schaeffler s lawyers to raise their concerns with the audit team s bosses they expressed how wrongheaded they thought the irs position was and how inappropriate its actions had been in june 2016 the irs sent schaeffler the official notice that the agency would seek unpaid tax and penalties schaeffler s attorneys continued to argue often above the heads of the audit team that the auditors interpretation was incorrect they held conference calls with top irs officials saying the audit team had given the schaeffler side mixed messages some on the team had assured schaeffler s attorneys that he would not face a large tax bill or be subject to a penalty top officials then met with the global high wealth team to discuss the issues the pushback is incredible one knowledgeable person recalled the pushback worked and here s where an audit is radically different from a court case court cases are typically accompanied by publicly available decisions and rulings that explain them in detail by contrast audits are shielded by the secrecy of the irs process they can end with no scrap of publicly available paper to memorialize key decisions in august 2016 in schaeffler s case officials several rungs up the irs hierarchy told the global high wealth team to withdraw the penalty from its request even without a penalty portion schaeffler would still owe the original 1 billion in taxes if the irs maintained its contention that the banks had cancelled his debt schaeffler s team then went to work on that too it succeeded by 2017 the irs had abandoned its assertion that debt had been transformed into equity after six years on a hard fought case the agency had effectively given up the irs had a few stray quibbles so the agency said it required a payment in the tens of millions according to two people familiar with the audit there the trail goes dark tax experts say schaeffler s team would likely have appealed even that offer which in many instances leads to further reductions in money owed but propublica could not ascertain that that occurred thanks in part to the u s government s bailout of the auto industry and the global economic recovery the schaeffler group s business rebounded despite a recent dip in the car market things have turned out ok for georg schaeffler today forbes estimates his fortune at over 13 billion

1p conventional natural gas reserves decreased 15 to 261 bcf from 307 bcf in the prior year and total proved plus probable 2p conventional natural gas reserves decreased 23 to 293 bcf from 380 bcf in the prior year the decrease is a consequence of 2018 additional gas production of 14 6 bcf lower anticipated forecasted sales and the reduction in the effective ownership interest in the gross property reserves due to the sale of a 7 9 non controlling interest in a subsidiary pae panafrican energy corporation paem described in note 3 to the tables below the net present value of the estimated future cash flows from the 2p reserves at a 10 discount rate npv10 decreased by 10 0 to us 294 4 million from us 326 1 million in the previous year the decrease is predominately the result of recognizing the non controlling interest in the dividend stream from paem in arriving at the present value and the decline in the forecast sales being offset by the removal of the ssn 1 well from the future development costs in the 2p life of licence valuation additional gas production in 2018 was 14 6 bcf equivalent to 39 9 mmcf day down 4 from 2017 due primarily to the reduced nominations of

act repeals earlier legislation provides a regulatory framework over upstream mid stream and downstream gas activity and as well consolidates and puts in place a single effective and comprehensive legal framework for regulating the oil and gas industry in the country the act also provides for the creation of an upstream regulator the petroleum upstream regulatory authority pura the mid and downstream petroleum as well as gas activities are proposed to be regulated by the current authority the energy and water utilities regulatory authority ewura the act also confers upon on the tanzanian petroleum development corporation tpdc the status of the national oil company mandated with the task of managing the country s commercial interest in the petroleum operations as well as mid and downstream natural gas activities the act vests tpdc with exclusive rights in the entire petroleum upstream value chain and the natural gas mid and downstream value chain however the exclusive rights of tpdc do not extend to mid and downstream petroleum supply operations the company is uncertain regarding the potential impact on its business in tanzania the act does provide grandfathering provisions upholding the rights of the company under the production sharing agreement as it was signed prior to the passing of the act however it is still unclear how the provisions of the act will be interpreted and implemented regarding upstream and downstream activities on october 7 2016 the government of tanzania issued the petroleum natural gas pricing regulation natural gas pricing regulation made under sections 165 and 258 i of the act article 260 3 preserves the company s pre existing right with tpdc to market and sell additional gas together or independently on terms and conditions

provided herein are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered actual reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein boes may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent 6 mcf 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead as the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 1 utilizing a conversion on a 6 1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value
on june 30 2016 an auto parts magnate received the kind of news anyone would dread the internal revenue service had determined he had engaged in abusive tax maneuvers he stood accused of masking about 5 billion in income the irs wanted over 1 2 billion in back taxes and penalties the magnate georg schaeffler was the billionaire scion of a family owned german manufacturer and was quietly working as a corporate lawyer in dallas schaeffler had extra reason to fear the irs it seemed he wasn t in the sights of just any division of the agency but the equivalent of its seal team 6 in 2009 the irs had formed a crack team of specialists to unravel the tax dodges of the ultrawealthy in an age of widening inequality with a concentration of wealth not seen since the gilded age the rich were evading taxes through ever more sophisticated maneuvers the irs commissioner aimed to stanch the country s losses with what he proclaimed would be a game changing strategy in short order charles rettig then a high powered tax lawyer and today president donald trump s irs commissioner warned that the squad was conducting the audits from hell if trump were being audited rettig wrote during the presidential campaign this is the elite team that would do it the wealth team embarked on a contentious audit of schaeffler in 2012 eventually determining that he owed about 1 2 billion in unpaid taxes and penalties but after seven years of grinding bureaucratic combat the irs abandoned its campaign the agency informed schaeffler s lawyers it was willing to accept just tens of millions according to a person familiar with the audit how did a case that consumed so many years of effort with a team of its finest experts working on a signature mission produce such a piddling result for the irs the schaeffler case offers a rare window into just how challenging it is to take on the ultrawealthy for starters they can devote seemingly limitless resources to hiring the best legal and accounting talent such taxpayers tend not to steamroll tax laws they employ complex highly refined strategies that seek to stretch the tax code to their advantage it can take years for irs investigators just to understand a transaction and deem it to be a violation once that happens the irs team has to contend with battalions of high priced lawyers and accountants that often outnumber and outgun even the agency s elite swat team we are nowhere near a circumstance where the irs could launch the types of audits we need to tackle sophisticated taxpayers in a complicated world said steven rosenthal who used to represent wealthy taxpayers and is now a senior fellow at the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and brookings institution because the audits are private irs officials can go to prison if they divulge taxpayer information details of the often epic paper battles between the rich and the tax collectors are sparse with little in the public record attorneys are also loath to talk about their clients taxes and most wealthy people strive to keep their financial affairs under wraps such disputes almost always settle out of court but propublica was able to reconstruct the key points in the schaeffler case the billionaire s lawyers and accountants first crafted a transaction of unusual complexity one so novel that they acknowledged even as they planned it that it was likely to be challenged by the irs then schaeffler deployed teams of professionals to battle the irs on multiple fronts they denied that he owed any money arguing the agency fundamentally misunderstood the tax issues schaeffler s representatives complained to top officials at the agency they challenged document requests in court at various times irs auditors felt schaeffler s side was purposely stalling but in the end schaeffler s team emerged almost completely victorious his experience was telling the irs new approach to taking on the superwealthy has been stymied the wealthy s lobbyists immediately pushed to defang the new team and soon after the group was formed republicans in congress began slashing the agency s budget as a result the team didn t receive the resources it was promised thousands of irs employees left from every corner of the agency especially ones with expertise in complex audits the kinds of specialists the agency hoped would staff the new elite unit the agency had planned to assign 242 examiners to the group by 2012 according to a report by the irs inspector general but by 2014 it had only 96 auditors by last year the number had fallen to 58 the wealth squad never came close to having the impact its proponents envisaged as robert gardner a 39 year veteran of the irs who often interacted with the team as a top official at the agency s tax whistleblower office put it from the minute it went live it was dead on arrival most people picture irs officials as all knowing and fearsome but when it comes to understanding how the superwealthy move their money around irs auditors historically have been more like high school physics teachers trying to operate the large hadron collider that began to change in the early 2000s after congress and the agency uncovered widespread use of abusive tax shelters by the rich the discovery led to criminal charges and settlements by major accounting firms by the end of the decade the irs had determined that millions of americans had secret bank accounts abroad the agency managed to crack open switzerland s banking secrecy and it recouped billions in lost tax revenue the irs came to realize it was not properly auditing the ultrawealthy multimillionaires frequently don t have easily visible income they often have trusts foundations limited liability companies complex partnerships and overseas operations all woven together to lower their tax bills when irs auditors examined their finances they typically looked narrowly they might scrutinize just one return for one entity and examine say a year s gifts or income belatedly attempting to confront improper tax avoidance the irs formed what was officially called the global high wealth industry group in 2009 the genesis was if you think of an incredibly wealthy family their web of entities somehow gives them a remarkably low effective tax rate said former irs commissioner steven miller who was one of those responsible for creating the wealth squad we hadn t really been looking at it all together and shame on us the irs located the group within the division that audits the biggest companies in recognition of the fact that the finances of the 1 percent resemble those of multinational corporations more than those of the average rich person the vision was clear as doug shulman a george w bush appointee who remained to helm the agency under the obama administration explained in a 2009 speech we want to better understand the entire economic picture of the enterprise controlled by the wealthy individual it s particularly important to audit the wealthy well and not simply because that s where the money is that s where the cheating is too studies show that the wealthiest are more likely to avoid paying taxes the top 0 5 percent in income account for fully a fifth of all the underreported income according to a 2010 study by the irs andrew johns and the university of michigan s joel slemrod adjusted for inflation that s more than 50 billion each year in unpaid taxes the plans for the wealth squad seemed like a step forward in a few years the group would be staffed with several hundred auditors a team of examiners would tackle each audit not just one or two agents as was more typical in the past the new group would draw from the irs best of the best that was crucial because irs auditors have a long standing reputation at least among the practitioners who represent deep pocketed taxpayers as hapless and overmatched the agents can fritter away years tax lawyers say auditing transactions they don t grasp in private practice we played whack a mole said rosenthal of the tax policy center the irs felt a transaction was suspect but couldn t figure out why so it would raise an issue and we d whack it and they would raise another and we d whack it the irs was ill equipped the global high wealth group was supposed to change that indeed with all the fanfare at the outset tax practitioners began to worry on behalf of their clientele the impression was it was all going to be specialists in fields highly trained the irs would assemble teams with the exact right expertise to target these issues chicago based tax attorney jenny johnson said the new group s first moves spurred resistance the team sent wide ranging requests for information seeking details about their targets entire empires taxpayers with more than 10 million in income or assets received a dozen pages of initial requests with the promise of many more to follow the agency sought years of details on every entity it could tie to the subject of the audits in past audits that initial overture had been limited to one or two pages with narrowly tailored requests here a typical request sought information on a vast array of issues one example a list of any u s or foreign entity in which the taxpayer held an at least a 20 percent interest including any hybrid instruments that could be turned into a 20 percent or more ownership share the taxpayer would then have to identify each and every current and former officer trustee and manager from the entity s inception taxpayers who received such requests recoiled attacking the core idea that shulman had said would animate the audits their attorneys and accountants argued the examinations sought too much information creating an onerous burden the audits proceeded into a proctology exam unearthing every aspect of their lives said mark allison a prominent tax attorney for caplin drysdale who has represented taxpayers undergoing global high wealth audits it was extraordinarily intrusive not surprisingly these people tend to be private and are not used to sharing tax practitioners took their concerns directly to the agency at american bar association conferences and during the aba s regular private meetings with top irs officials part of our approach was to have private sit downs to raise issues and concerns said allison who has served in top roles in the aba s tax division for years we were telling them this was too much unwieldy and therefore unfair allison said he told high ranking irs officials you need to rein in these audit teams for years politicians have hammered the irs for its supposed abuse of taxpayers congress created a taxpayer bill of rights in the mid 1990s today the irs often refers to its work as customer service one result of constant congressional scrutiny is that senior irs officials are willing to meet with top tax lawyers and address their concerns there was help there they stuck their necks out for me allison said the irs publicly retreated speaking at a washington d c bar association event in february 2013 a top irs official james fee conceded the demands were too detailed and long telling the gathering that the agency has taken strides to make sure it doesn t happen again the global high wealth group began to limit its initial document requests the lobbying campaign combined with the lack of funding for the group took its toll one report estimated that the wealth team had audited only around a dozen wealthy taxpayers in its first two and a half years in a september 2015 report the irs inspector general said the agency had failed to establish the team as a standalone group capable of conducting all of its own examinations the group didn t have steady leadership with three directors in its first five years when it did audit the ultrawealthy more than 40 percent the reviews resulted in no additional taxes the inspector general also criticized the irs broadly not just its high wealth team for not focusing enough on the richest taxpayers in 2010 the irs as a whole audited over 32 000 millionaires by 2018 that number had fallen to just over 16 000 according to data compiled by syracuse university audits of the wealthiest americans have collapsed 52 percent since 2011 falling more substantially than audits of the middle class and the poor almost half of audits of the wealthy were of taxpayers making 200 000 to 399 000 those audits brought in 605 per audit hour worked exams of those making over 5 million by contrast brought in more than 4 500 an hour the irs didn t even have the resources to pursue millionaires who had been hit with a hefty tax bill and simply stiffed uncle sam it appeared to no longer emphasize the collection of delinquent accounts of global high wealth taxpayers a 2017 inspector general report said in recent years the number of global high wealth audits has been higher it closed 149 audits in the last year but tax lawyers and former irs officials say even that improvement is deceptive a major reason is that the audits are much less ambitious they were longer at the beginning and shorter as the process moved on johnson the tax attorney said inside the irs agents seethed the whole organization was very frustrated gardner said they were just really not sure what the hell their mission was what they were supposed to be accomplishing georg schaeffler 54 has flowing salt and pepper hair that makes him look like he could ve been an actor on the 1980s tv show dynasty the impression is offset by the wire rim glasses he wears and by the bookish disposition of a person who as a teenager once asked for a copy of the german constitution as a present as a younger man schaeffler tried to escape his legacy he left germany and the family company at a young age and lit out for the american west he was trying to make it on his own where people don t know who you are as he would tell a reporter for a magazine profile years later some might escape to texas to live a bit wild schaeffler became a corporate lawyer schaeffler s law firm colleagues didn t know much more than that he spoke with an accent and certainly not that he was vastly wealthy that is until he landed on the forbes list of global billionaires rueful at the loss of his privacy schaeffler once declared i hate forbes the family s riches stemmed from ball bearings and other automobile parts manufactured by the schaeffler group which was founded by schaeffler s father and then passed to his mother after his father died by 2006 georg pronounced gay org owned 80 percent of the enterprise and his mother the remaining 20 percent as a texas resident at that time schaeffler was required to pay u s income taxes he very nearly lost it all in 2008 schaeffler group made a big mistake it offered to buy continental ag a tiremaker just days before the stock and credit markets experienced their worst crisis since the great depression even as continental s stock price crashed schaeffler was legally obligated to go through with its purchase at the much higher pre crash price schaeffler group flirted with bankruptcy and pleaded for aid from the german government the media began to pay closer attention to the private company and the low profile family that ran it german press accounts dismissed schaeffler s mother as the billionaire beggar for seeking a bailout and pilloried her for wearing a fur coat at a ski race while seeking government help no german government aid came the schaeffler group teetered and the family s fortune plummeted from 9 billion to almost zero amid the crisis over continental georg accepted his fate and took up a more prominent role at the company he s now the chairman of its supervisory board to pay for continental schaeffler group borrowed about 11 billion euros from a consortium of banks at the time schaeffler s lenders including royal bank of scotland were desperate too having suffered enormous losses on home mortgages they wanted to avoid any more write downs that might result if the company defaulted on the loans so in 2009 and 2010 schaeffler s lenders restructured the debt in a devilishly complex series of transactions by 2012 these maneuvers had caught the eye of the global high wealth group paul doerr an experienced revenue agent would head the audit eventually the irs discerned what it came to believe was the transaction s essence the banks had effectively forgiven nearly half of schaeffler s debt to the irs that had significant tax implications in the wealth team s view georg schaeffler had received billions of dollars of income on which he owed taxes the auditors view reflects a core aspect of the u s tax system under american law companies and individuals are liable for taxes on the forgiven portion of any loan this frequently comes up in the housing market a homeowner borrows 100 000 from a bank to buy a house prices fall and the homeowner under financial duress unloads it for 80 000 if the bank forgives the 20 000 still owed on the original mortgage the owner pays taxes on that amount as if it were ordinary income this levy can seem unfair since it often hits borrowers who have run into trouble paying back their debts the problem was particularly acute during the housing crisis so in late 2007 congress passed a bill that protected most homeowners from being hit with a tax bill after foreclosure or otherwise getting a principal reduction from their lender tax experts say the principle of taxing forgiven loans is crucial to preventing chicanery without it people could arrange with their employers to borrow their salaries through the entire year interest free and then have the employer forgive the loan at the very end voila no taxable income the notion that forgiven debt is taxable applies to corporate transactions too that means concern about such a tax bill is rarely far from a distressed corporate debtor s mind any time you have a troubled situation it s a typical tax issue you have to address and the banks certainly understand it too said les samuels an attorney who spent decades advising corporations and wealthy individuals on tax matters but the efforts to avoid tax in the case of schaeffler and his lenders took a particularly convoluted form it involved several different instruments each with multiple moving parts the refinancing was complicated and unusual said samuels who was not involved in the transaction if you were sitting in the government s chair and reading press reports on the situation your reaction might be that the company was on the verge of being insolvent and when the refinancing was completed the government might think that banks didn t know whether they would be repaid this account of the audit was drawn from conversations with people familiar with it who were not authorized to speak on the record as well as court and german securities filings the irs declined to comment for this story doerr did not respond to repeated calls and emails a spokesman for schaeffler declined to make him available for an interview mr schaeffler always strives to comply with the complex u s tax code the spokesman wrote in a statement saying the fact that the refinancing was with six independent international banks in itself demonstrates that these were arm s length commercially driven transactions the irs professionally concluded the audit in 2018 without making adjustments to those transactions and there is no continuing dispute either administratively or in litigation related to these matters schaeffler s lenders never explicitly canceled the loan the banks and schaeffler maintained to the irs that the loan was real and no debt had been forgiven the irs came not to buy that after years of trying to unravel the refinancing the irs homed in on what the agency contended was a disguise the banks and schaeffler had a mutual interest in maintaining the appearance that the debt hadn t gone away a person familiar with the transaction said but the irs believed the debt had in fact been canceled in the refinancing the banks and schaeffler had agreed to split the company s debt which had grown to 12 billion euros at that point into two pieces a senior loan to be paid back first worth about 7 billion euros and a junior piece worth about 5 billion euros schaeffler s income producing assets were placed into the entity that held the senior debt schaeffler was required to repay the debt according to a schedule and to pay a meaningful interest rate 4 25 percentage points above the rate his lenders charge each other to borrow money in short it appeared to be a relatively straightforward debt transaction the junior debt was another matter and its provisions would raise the hackles of the irs to begin with the entity that held the junior debt did not directly hold income producing assets there was no schedule of payments that schaeffler had to make on the junior debt he wasn t obligated to make principal payments until the end of the loan s term and it carried a nearly nonexistent annual interest rate of 0 1 percentage points above prevailing interbank lending rates plus an additional 7 percent per year which schaeffler could choose to defer and pay at the end of the term the banks attached two other provisions to the refinancing a contingent remuneration payment and a contingent upside instrument according to german securities filings the two additions called for schaeffler to make payments to the future performance of the company the irs and schaeffler s team fought especially over the contingent upside instrument its value was tied to the schaeffler group s future profitability just like a share of stock would be the irs argued that not only was this an equitylike sweetener to the banks but that it tainted the entire junior portion of the debt to the irs it looked like the banks had a claim on future payments from schaeffler but they didn t know when they d receive it or even if they would ever get anything to the irs these steps all added up to the effective cancellation of about 5 billion worth of debt for which the banks had received something in return that something looked and acted very much like equity the schaeffler audit was one of the biggest for the global high wealth group the irs assigned a larger than normal team to the exam the agency would send 86 separate document requests to schaeffler through july 2013 but there were problems almost from the beginning according to people familiar with the audit who provided this account and chronology the irs examiners disagreed with one another over strategy the debates sometimes spilled into the view of schaeffler s team i remember a tremendous amount of turnover from the exam team and infighting they were not presenting a coherent message a person in the schaeffler camp said by contrast schaeffler s team of lawyers and accountants was large and unified these taxpayers aren t exactly represented by h r block gardner the retired irs official said schaeffler s advisers threw as much as they could back at the agency document requests are typically voluntary at the outset but at one point an irs auditor was frustrated at what the team saw as the schaeffler team s resistance and delays and demanded would a summons help according to a person familiar with the exam schaeffler s team complained about the perceived threat the irs scolded its employee and doerr the lead auditor apologized to the schaeffler side according to the person in another instance the irs could not get information it sought from ernst young the accounting firm related to its advice to schaeffler so it sued the accounting firm in early 2014 ernst young contended the material was privileged because it was prepared in anticipation of litigation the irs won in the u s district court for the southern district of new york but ernst young appealed in early november 2015 with the ernst young appeal unresolved top irs officials gave the schaeffler audit team the permission it was looking for they allowed the auditors to notify schaeffler that they believed he d failed to disclose about 5 billion in income and that he could expect a 1 2 billion tax bill that included some 200 million in penalties because the agency viewed the transaction as abusive only days later the irs was dealt a defeat that would further hamstring its ability to press its case on nov 10 the 2nd u s circuit court of appeals reversed the district judge slapping down the irs efforts to get the ernst young documents ruling they were in fact protected by privilege the irs had no choice it would have to proceed without the documents the irs took solace that despite the adverse ruling on the documents the appeals court appeared to bolster the irs view of the transaction describing it as a complex and novel refinancing the court said the consortium of banks essentially insured schaeffler by extending credit and subordinating its debt the opinion found that schaeffler s team had known that litigation over the transaction was virtually inevitable underscoring the sense that the billionaire s lawyers and accountants knew they were pushing legal limits the two sides wrangled even over routine procedural matters the statute of limitations was about to run out usually the taxpayer voluntarily agrees to extend the time limit rather than antagonize the agents doing an audit but schaeffler s team raised the prospect of refusing an extension they ultimately relented but succeeded in amping up the pressure on the auditors even as the antagonism built between the two sides the irs showed deference to the schaeffler camp doerr gave schaeffler s attorneys a heads up that the agency was going to deliver bad news an action that was viewed as overly solicitous according to one person it gave an opening for schaeffler s lawyers to raise their concerns with the audit team s bosses they expressed how wrongheaded they thought the irs position was and how inappropriate its actions had been in june 2016 the irs sent schaeffler the official notice that the agency would seek unpaid tax and penalties schaeffler s attorneys continued to argue often above the heads of the audit team that the auditors interpretation was incorrect they held conference calls with top irs officials saying the audit team had given the schaeffler side mixed messages some on the team had assured schaeffler s attorneys that he would not face a large tax bill or be subject to a penalty top officials then met with the global high wealth team to discuss the issues the pushback is incredible one knowledgeable person recalled the pushback worked and here s where an audit is radically different from a court case court cases are typically accompanied by publicly available decisions and rulings that explain them in detail by contrast audits are shielded by the secrecy of the irs process they can end with no scrap of publicly available paper to memorialize key decisions in august 2016 in schaeffler s case officials several rungs up the irs hierarchy told the global high wealth team to withdraw the penalty from its request even without a penalty portion schaeffler would still owe the original 1 billion in taxes if the irs maintained its contention that the banks had cancelled his debt schaeffler s team then went to work on that too it succeeded by 2017 the irs had abandoned its assertion that debt had been transformed into equity after six years on a hard fought case the agency had effectively given up the irs had a few stray quibbles so the agency said it required a payment in the tens of millions according to two people familiar with the audit there the trail goes dark tax experts say schaeffler s team would likely have appealed even that offer which in many instances leads to further reductions in money owed but propublica could not ascertain that that occurred thanks in part to the u s government s bailout of the auto industry and the global economic recovery the schaeffler group s business rebounded despite a recent dip in the car market things have turned out ok for georg schaeffler today forbes estimates his fortune at over 13 billion

maneuvers he stood accused of masking about 5 billion in income the irs wanted over 1 2 billion in back taxes and penalties the magnate georg schaeffler was the billionaire scion of a family owned german manufacturer and was quietly working as a corporate lawyer in dallas schaeffler had extra reason to fear the irs it seemed he wasn t in the sights of just any division of the agency but the equivalent of its seal team 6 in 2009 the irs had formed a crack team of specialists to unravel the tax dodges of the ultrawealthy in an age of widening inequality with a concentration of wealth not seen since the gilded age the rich were evading taxes through ever more sophisticated maneuvers the irs commissioner aimed to stanch the country s losses with what he proclaimed would be a game changing strategy in short order charles rettig then a high powered tax lawyer and today president donald trump s irs commissioner warned that the squad was conducting the audits from hell if trump were being audited rettig wrote during the presidential campaign this is the elite team that would do it georg schaeffler faced a 1 2 billion tax bill after his company restructured a huge debt julian stratenschulte picture alliance via getty images the wealth team embarked on a contentious audit of schaeffler in 2012 eventually determining that he owed about 1 2 billion in unpaid taxes and penalties but after seven years of grinding bureaucratic combat the irs abandoned its campaign the agency informed schaeffler s lawyers it was willing to accept just tens of millions according to a person familiar with the audit how did a case that consumed so many years of effort with a team of its finest experts working on a signature mission produce such a piddling result for the irs the schaeffler case offers a rare window into just how challenging it is to take on the ultrawealthy for starters they can devote seemingly limitless resources to hiring the best legal and accounting talent such taxpayers tend not to steamroll tax laws they employ complex highly refined strategies that seek to stretch the tax code to their advantage it can take years for irs investigators just to understand a transaction and deem it to be a violation once that happens the irs team has to contend with battalions of high priced lawyers and accountants that often outnumber and outgun even the agency s elite swat team we are nowhere near a circumstance where the irs could launch the types of audits we need to tackle sophisticated taxpayers in a complicated world said steven rosenthal who used to represent wealthy taxpayers and is now a senior fellow at the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and brookings institution because the audits are private irs officials can go to prison if they divulge taxpayer information details of the often epic paper battles between the rich and the tax collectors are sparse with little in the public record attorneys are also loath to talk about their clients taxes and most wealthy people strive to keep their financial affairs under wraps such disputes almost always settle out of court have you been involved in a global high wealth audit if so we d like to hear about your experiences email or on signal at 718 496 5233 but propublica was able to reconstruct the key points in the schaeffler case the billionaire s lawyers and accountants first crafted a transaction of unusual complexity one so novel that they acknowledged even as they planned it that it was likely to be challenged by the irs then schaeffler deployed teams of professionals to battle the irs on multiple fronts they denied that he owed any money arguing the agency fundamentally misunderstood the tax issues schaeffler s representatives complained to top officials at the agency they challenged document requests in court at various times irs auditors felt schaeffler s side was purposely stalling but in the end schaeffler s team emerged almost completely victorious his experience was telling the irs new approach to taking on the superwealthy has been stymied the wealthy s lobbyists immediately pushed to defang the new team and soon after the group was formed republicans in congress began slashing the agency s budget as a result the team didn t receive the resources it was promised thousands of irs employees left from every corner of the agency especially ones with expertise in complex audits the kinds of specialists the agency hoped would staff the new elite unit the agency had planned to assign 242 examiners to the group by 2012 according to a report by the irs inspector general but by 2014 it had only 96 auditors by last year the number had fallen to 58 the wealth squad never came close to having the impact its proponents envisaged as robert gardner a 39 year veteran of the irs who often interacted with the team as a top official at the agency s tax whistleblower office put it from the minute it went live it was dead on arrival most people picture irs officials as all knowing and fearsome but when it comes to understanding how the superwealthy move their money around irs auditors historically have been more like high school physics teachers trying to operate the large hadron collider charles rettig commissioner of the internal revenue service said if any group were auditing donald trump it would be the global high wealth team aaron p bernstein getty images that began to change in the early 2000s after congress and the agency uncovered widespread use of abusive tax shelters by the rich the discovery led to criminal charges and settlements by major accounting firms by the end of the decade the irs had determined that millions of americans had secret bank accounts abroad the agency managed to crack open switzerland s banking secrecy and it recouped billions in lost tax revenue the irs came to realize it was not properly auditing the ultrawealthy multimillionaires frequently don t have easily visible income they often have trusts foundations limited liability companies complex partnerships and overseas operations all woven together to lower their tax bills when irs auditors examined their finances they typically looked narrowly they might scrutinize just one return for one entity and examine say a year s gifts or income belatedly attempting to confront improper tax avoidance the irs formed what was officially called the global high wealth industry group in 2009 the genesis was if you think of an incredibly wealthy family their web of entities somehow gives them a remarkably low effective tax rate said former irs commissioner steven miller who was one of those responsible for creating the wealth squad we hadn t really been looking at it all together and shame on us the irs located the group within the division that audits the biggest companies in recognition of the fact that the finances of the 1 percent resemble those of multinational corporations more than those of the average rich person former irs commissioner steven miller tried to fix the agency s approach to auditing the ultrawealthy nicholas kamm afp getty images the vision was clear as doug shulman a george w bush appointee who remained to helm the agency under the obama administration explained in a 2009 speech we want to better understand the entire economic picture of the enterprise controlled by the wealthy individual it s particularly important to audit the wealthy well and not simply because that s where the money is that s where the cheating is too studies show that the wealthiest are more likely to avoid paying taxes the top 0 5 percent in income account for fully a fifth of all the underreported income according to a 2010 study by the irs andrew johns and the university of michigan s joel slemrod adjusted for inflation that s more than 50 billion each year in unpaid taxes the plans for the wealth squad seemed like a step forward in a few years the group would be staffed with several hundred auditors a team of examiners would tackle each audit not just one or two agents as was more typical in the past the new group would draw from the irs best of the best that was crucial because irs auditors have a long standing reputation at least among the practitioners who represent deep pocketed taxpayers as hapless and overmatched the agents can fritter away years tax lawyers say auditing transactions they don t grasp in private practice we played whack a mole said rosenthal of the tax policy center the irs felt a transaction was suspect but couldn t figure out why so it would raise an issue and we d whack it and they would raise another and we d whack it the irs was ill equipped the global high wealth group was supposed to change that indeed with all the fanfare at the outset tax practitioners began to worry on behalf of their clientele the impression was it was all going to be specialists in fields highly trained the irs would assemble teams with the exact right expertise to target these issues chicago based tax attorney jenny johnson said the new group s first moves spurred resistance the team sent wide ranging requests for information

the forgiven portion of any loan this frequently comes up in the housing market a homeowner borrows 100 000 from a bank to buy a house prices fall and the homeowner under financial duress unloads it for 80 000 if the bank forgives the 20 000 still owed on the original mortgage the owner pays taxes on that amount as if it were ordinary income this levy can seem unfair since it often hits borrowers who have run into trouble paying back their debts the problem was particularly acute during the housing crisis so in late 2007 congress passed a bill that protected most homeowners from being hit with a tax bill after foreclosure or otherwise getting a principal reduction from their lender tax experts say the principle of taxing forgiven loans is crucial to preventing chicanery without it people could arrange with their employers to borrow their salaries through the entire year interest free and then have the employer forgive the loan at the very end voila no taxable income the notion that forgiven debt is taxable applies to corporate transactions too that means concern about such a tax bill is rarely far from a distressed corporate debtor s mind any time you have a troubled situation it s a typical tax issue you have to address and the banks certainly understand it too said les samuels an attorney who spent decades advising corporations and wealthy individuals on tax matters but

grown to 12 billion euros at that point into two pieces a senior loan to be paid back first worth about 7 billion euros and a junior piece worth about 5 billion euros schaeffler s income producing assets were placed into the entity that held the senior debt schaeffler was required to repay the debt according to a schedule and to pay a meaningful interest rate 4 25 percentage points above the

hackles of the irs to begin with the entity that held the junior debt did not directly hold income producing assets there was no schedule of payments that schaeffler had to make on the junior debt he wasn t obligated to make principal payments until the end of the loan s term and it carried a nearly nonexistent annual interest rate of 0 1 percentage points above prevailing interbank lending rates plus an additional 7 percent per year which schaeffler could choose to defer and pay at the end of the term the banks attached two other provisions to the refinancing a contingent remuneration payment and a contingent upside instrument according to german securities filings the two additions called for schaeffler to make payments to the future performance of the company the irs and schaeffler s team fought especially over the contingent upside instrument its value was tied to the schaeffler group s future profitability just like a share of stock would be the irs argued that not only was this an equitylike sweetener to the banks but that it tainted the entire junior portion of the debt to the irs it looked like the banks had a claim on future payments from schaeffler but they didn t know

something in return that something looked and acted very much like equity the schaeffler audit was one of the biggest for the global high wealth group the irs assigned a larger than normal team to the exam the agency would send 86 separate document requests to schaeffler through july 2013 but there were problems almost from the beginning according to people familiar with the audit who provided this account and chronology the irs examiners disagreed with one another over strategy the debates sometimes spilled into the view of schaeffler s team i remember a tremendous amount of turnover from the

superwealthy have been a bust michael brochstein sopa images lightrocket via getty images in another instance the irs could not get information it sought from ernst young the accounting firm related to its advice to schaeffler so it sued the accounting firm in early 2014 ernst young contended the material was privileged because it was prepared in anticipation of litigation the irs won in the u s district court for the southern district of new york but ernst young appealed in early november 2015 with the ernst young appeal unresolved top irs officials gave the schaeffler audit team the permission it was looking for they allowed the auditors to notify schaeffler that they believed he d failed to disclose about 5 billion in income and that he could expect a 1 2 billion tax bill that included some 200 million in penalties because the agency viewed the transaction as abusive only days later the irs was dealt a defeat that would further hamstring its ability to press its case on nov 10 the 2nd u s circuit court of appeals reversed the district judge slapping down the irs efforts to get the ernst young documents ruling they were in fact protected by privilege the irs had no choice it would have to proceed without the documents the irs took solace that despite the adverse ruling on the documents the appeals court appeared to bolster the irs view of the transaction describing it as a complex and novel refinancing the court said the consortium of banks essentially insured schaeffler by extending credit and subordinating its debt the opinion found that schaeffler s team had known that litigation over the transaction was virtually inevitable underscoring the sense that the billionaire s lawyers and accountants knew they were pushing legal limits the two sides wrangled even over routine procedural matters the statute of limitations was about to run out usually the taxpayer voluntarily agrees to extend the time limit rather than antagonize the agents doing an audit but schaeffler s team raised the prospect of refusing an extension they ultimately relented but succeeded in amping up the pressure on the auditors even as the antagonism built between the two sides the irs showed deference to the schaeffler camp doerr gave schaeffler s attorneys a heads up that the agency was going to deliver bad news an action that was viewed as overly solicitous according to one person it gave an opening for schaeffler s lawyers to raise their concerns with the audit team s bosses they expressed how wrongheaded they thought the irs position was and how inappropriate its actions had been in june 2016 the irs sent schaeffler the official notice that the agency would seek unpaid tax and penalties schaeffler s attorneys continued to argue often above the heads of the audit team that the auditors interpretation was incorrect they held conference calls with top irs officials saying the audit team had given the schaeffler side mixed messages some on the team had assured schaeffler s attorneys that he would not face a large tax bill or be subject to a penalty top officials then met with the global high wealth team to discuss the issues the pushback is incredible one knowledgeable person recalled the pushback worked and here s where an audit is radically different from a court case court cases are typically accompanied by publicly available decisions and rulings that explain them in detail by contrast audits are shielded by the secrecy of the irs process they can end with no scrap of publicly available paper to memorialize key decisions in august 2016 in schaeffler s case officials several rungs up the irs hierarchy told the global high wealth team to withdraw the penalty from its request even without a penalty portion schaeffler would still owe the original 1 billion in taxes if the irs maintained its contention that the banks had cancelled his debt schaeffler s team then went to work on that too it succeeded by 2017 the irs had abandoned its assertion that debt had been transformed into equity after six years on a hard fought case the agency had effectively given up the irs had a few stray quibbles so the agency said it required a payment in the tens of millions according to two people familiar with the audit there the trail goes dark tax experts say schaeffler s team would likely have appealed even that offer which in many instances leads to further reductions in money owed but propublica could not ascertain that that occurred thanks in part to the u s government s bailout of the auto industry and the global

on june 30 2016 an auto parts magnate received the kind of news anyone would dread the internal revenue service had determined he had engaged in abusive tax maneuvers he stood accused of masking about 5 billion in income the irs wanted over 1 2 billion in back taxes and penalties the magnate georg schaeffler was the billionaire scion of a family owned german manufacturer and was quietly working as a corporate lawyer in dallas schaeffler had extra reason to fear the irs it seemed he wasn t in the sights of just any division of the agency but the equivalent of its seal team 6 in 2009 the irs had formed a crack team of specialists to unravel the tax dodges of the ultrawealthy in an age of widening inequality with a concentration of wealth not seen since the gilded age the rich were evading taxes through ever more sophisticated maneuvers the irs commissioner aimed to stanch the country s losses with what he proclaimed would be a game changing strategy in short order charles rettig then a high powered tax lawyer and today president donald trump s irs commissioner warned that the squad was conducting the audits from hell if trump were being audited rettig wrote during the presidential campaign this is the elite team that would do it the wealth team embarked on a contentious audit of schaeffler in 2012 eventually determining that he owed about 1 2 billion in unpaid taxes and penalties but after seven years of grinding bureaucratic combat the irs abandoned its campaign the agency informed schaeffler s lawyers it was willing to accept just tens of millions according to a person familiar with the audit how did a case that consumed so many years of effort with a team of its finest experts working on a signature mission produce such a piddling result for the irs the schaeffler case offers a rare window into just how challenging it is to take on the ultrawealthy for starters they can devote seemingly limitless resources to hiring the best legal and accounting talent such taxpayers tend not to steamroll tax laws they employ complex highly refined strategies that seek to stretch the tax code to their advantage it can take years for irs investigators just to understand a transaction and deem it to be a violation once that happens the irs team has to contend with battalions of high priced lawyers and accountants that often outnumber and outgun even the agency s elite swat team we are nowhere near a circumstance where the irs could launch the types of audits we need to tackle sophisticated taxpayers in a complicated world said steven rosenthal who used to represent wealthy taxpayers and is now a senior fellow at the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and brookings institution because the audits are private irs officials can go to prison if they divulge taxpayer information details of the often epic paper battles between the rich and the tax collectors are sparse with little in the public record attorneys are also loath to talk about their clients taxes and most wealthy people strive to keep their financial affairs under wraps such disputes almost always settle out of court but propublica was able to reconstruct the key points in the schaeffler case the billionaire s lawyers and accountants first crafted a transaction of unusual complexity one so novel that they acknowledged even as they planned it that it was likely to be challenged by the irs then schaeffler deployed teams of professionals to battle the irs on multiple fronts they denied that he owed any money arguing the agency fundamentally misunderstood the tax issues schaeffler s representatives complained to top officials at the agency they challenged document requests in court at various times irs auditors felt schaeffler s side was purposely stalling but in the end schaeffler s team emerged almost completely victorious his experience was telling the irs new approach to taking on the superwealthy has been stymied the wealthy s lobbyists immediately pushed to defang the new team and soon after the group was formed republicans in congress began slashing the agency s budget as a result the team didn t receive the resources it was promised thousands of irs employees left from every corner of the agency especially ones with expertise in complex audits the kinds of specialists the agency hoped would staff the new elite unit the agency had planned to assign 242 examiners to the group by 2012 according to a report by the irs inspector general but by 2014 it had only 96 auditors by last year the number had fallen to 58 the wealth squad never came close to having the impact its proponents envisaged as robert gardner a 39 year veteran of the irs who often interacted with the team as a top official at the agency s tax whistleblower office put it from the minute it went live it was dead on arrival most people picture irs officials as all knowing and fearsome but when it comes to understanding how the superwealthy move their money around irs auditors historically have been more like high school physics teachers trying to operate the large hadron collider that began to change in the early 2000s after congress and the agency uncovered widespread use of abusive tax shelters by the rich the discovery led to criminal charges and settlements by major accounting firms by the end of the decade the irs had determined that millions of americans had secret bank accounts abroad the agency managed to crack open switzerland s banking secrecy and it recouped billions in lost tax revenue the irs came to realize it was not properly auditing the ultrawealthy multimillionaires frequently don t have easily visible income they often have trusts foundations limited liability companies complex partnerships and overseas operations all woven together to lower their tax bills when irs auditors examined their finances they typically looked narrowly they might scrutinize just one return for one entity and examine say a year s gifts or income belatedly attempting to confront improper tax avoidance the irs formed what was officially called the global high wealth industry group in 2009 the genesis was if you think of an incredibly wealthy family their web of entities somehow gives them a remarkably low effective tax rate said former irs commissioner steven miller who was one of those responsible for creating the wealth squad we hadn t really been looking at it all together and shame on us the irs located the group within the division that audits the biggest companies in recognition of the fact that the finances of the 1 percent resemble those of multinational corporations more than those of the average rich person the vision was clear as doug shulman a george w bush appointee who remained to helm the agency under the obama administration explained in a 2009 speech we want to better understand the entire economic picture of the enterprise controlled by the wealthy individual it s particularly important to audit the wealthy well and not simply because that s where the money is that s where the cheating is too studies show that the wealthiest are more likely to avoid paying taxes the top 0 5 percent in income account for fully a fifth of all the underreported income according to a 2010 study by the irs andrew johns and the university of michigan s joel slemrod adjusted for inflation that s more than 50 billion each year in unpaid taxes the plans for the wealth squad seemed like a step forward in a few years the group would be staffed with several hundred auditors a team of examiners would tackle each audit not just one or two agents as was more typical in the past the new group would draw from the irs best of the best that was crucial because irs auditors have a long standing reputation at least among the practitioners who represent deep pocketed taxpayers as hapless and overmatched the agents can fritter away years tax lawyers say auditing transactions they don t grasp in private practice we played whack a mole said rosenthal of the tax policy center the irs felt a transaction was suspect but couldn t figure out why so it would raise an issue and we d whack it and they would raise another and we d whack it the irs was ill equipped the global high wealth group was supposed to change that indeed with all the fanfare at the outset tax practitioners began to worry on behalf of their clientele the impression was it was all going to be specialists in fields highly trained the irs would assemble teams with the exact right expertise to target these issues chicago based tax attorney jenny johnson said the new group s first moves spurred resistance the team sent wide ranging requests for information seeking details about their targets entire empires taxpayers with more than 10 million in income or assets received a dozen pages of initial requests with the promise of many more to follow the agency sought years of details on every entity it could tie to the subject of the audits in past audits that initial overture had been limited to one or two pages with narrowly tailored requests here a typical request sought information on a vast array of issues one example a list of any u s or foreign entity in which the taxpayer held an at least a 20 percent interest including any hybrid instruments that could be turned into a 20 percent or more ownership share the taxpayer would then have to identify each and every current and former officer trustee and manager from the entity s inception taxpayers who received such requests recoiled attacking the core idea that shulman had said would animate the audits their attorneys and accountants argued the examinations sought too much information creating an onerous burden the audits proceeded into a proctology exam unearthing every aspect of their lives said mark allison a prominent tax attorney for caplin drysdale who has represented taxpayers undergoing global high wealth audits it was extraordinarily intrusive not surprisingly these people tend to be private and are not used to sharing tax practitioners took their concerns directly to the agency at american bar association conferences and during the aba s regular private meetings with top irs officials part of our approach was to have private sit downs to raise issues and concerns said allison who has served in top roles in the aba s tax division for years we were telling them this was too much unwieldy and therefore unfair allison said he told high ranking irs officials you need to rein in these audit teams for years politicians have hammered the irs for its supposed abuse of taxpayers congress created a taxpayer bill of rights in the mid 1990s today the irs often refers to its work as customer service one result of constant congressional scrutiny is that senior irs officials are willing to meet with top tax lawyers and address their concerns there was help there they stuck their necks out for me allison said the irs publicly retreated speaking at a washington d c bar association event in february 2013 a top irs official james fee conceded the demands were too detailed and long telling the gathering that the agency has taken strides to make sure it doesn t happen again the global high wealth group began to limit its initial document requests the lobbying campaign combined with the lack of funding for the group took its toll one report estimated that the wealth team had audited only around a dozen wealthy taxpayers in its first two and a half years in a september 2015 report the irs inspector general said the agency had failed to establish the team as a standalone group capable of conducting all of its own examinations the group didn t have steady leadership with three directors in its first five years when it did audit the ultrawealthy more than 40 percent of the reviews resulted in no additional taxes the inspector general also criticized the irs broadly not just its high wealth team for not focusing enough on the richest taxpayers in 2010 the irs as a whole audited over 32 000 millionaires by 2018 that number had fallen to just over 16 000 according to data compiled by syracuse university audits of the wealthiest americans have collapsed 52 percent since 2011 falling more substantially than audits of the middle class and the poor almost half of audits of the wealthy were of taxpayers making 200 000 to 399 000 those audits brought in 605 per audit hour worked exams of those making over 5 million by contrast brought in more than 4 500 an hour the irs didn t even have the resources to pursue millionaires who had been hit with a hefty tax bill and simply stiffed uncle sam it appeared to no longer emphasize the collection of delinquent accounts of global high wealth taxpayers a 2017 inspector general report said in recent years the number of global high wealth audits has been higher it closed 149 audits in the last year but tax lawyers and former irs officials say even that improvement is deceptive a major reason is that the audits are much less ambitious they were longer at the beginning and shorter as the process moved on johnson the tax attorney said inside the irs agents seethed the whole organization was very frustrated gardner said they were just really not sure what the hell their mission was what they were supposed to be accomplishing georg schaeffler 54 has flowing salt and pepper hair that makes him look like he could ve been an actor on the 1980s tv show dynasty the impression is offset by the wire rim glasses he wears and by the bookish disposition of a person who as a teenager once asked for a copy of the german constitution as a present as a younger man schaeffler tried to escape his legacy he left germany and the family company at a young age and lit out for the american west he was trying to make it on his own where people don t know who you are as he would tell a reporter for a magazine profile years later some might escape to texas to live a bit wild schaeffler became a corporate lawyer schaeffler s law firm colleagues didn t know much more than that he spoke with an accent and certainly not that he was vastly wealthy that is until he landed on the forbes list of global billionaires rueful at the loss of his privacy schaeffler once declared i hate forbes the family s riches stemmed from ball bearings and other automobile parts manufactured by the schaeffler group which was founded by schaeffler s father and then passed to his mother after his father died by 2006 georg pronounced gay org owned 80 percent of the enterprise and his mother the remaining 20 percent as a texas resident at that time schaeffler was required to pay u s income taxes he very nearly lost it all in 2008 schaeffler group made a big mistake it offered to buy continental ag a tiremaker just days before the stock and credit markets experienced their worst crisis since the great depression even as continental s stock price crashed schaeffler was legally obligated to go through with its purchase at the much higher pre crash price schaeffler group flirted with bankruptcy and pleaded for

maneuvers he stood accused of masking about 5 billion in income the irs wanted over 1 2 billion in back taxes and penalties the magnate georg schaeffler was the billionaire scion of a family owned german manufacturer and was quietly working as a corporate lawyer in dallas schaeffler had extra reason to fear the irs it seemed he wasn t in the sights of just any division of the agency but the equivalent of its seal team 6 in 2009 the irs had formed a crack team of specialists to unravel the tax dodges of the ultrawealthy in an age of widening inequality with a concentration of wealth not seen since the gilded age the rich were evading taxes through ever more sophisticated maneuvers the irs commissioner aimed to stanch the country s losses with what he proclaimed would be a game changing strategy in short order charles rettig then a high powered tax lawyer and today president donald trump s irs commissioner warned that the squad was conducting the audits from hell if trump were being audited rettig wrote during the presidential campaign this is the elite team that would do it georg schaeffler faced a 1 2 billion tax bill after his company restructured a huge debt julian stratenschulte picture alliance via getty images the wealth team embarked on a contentious audit of schaeffler in 2012 eventually determining that he owed about 1 2 billion in unpaid taxes and penalties but after seven years of grinding bureaucratic combat the irs abandoned its campaign the agency informed schaeffler s lawyers it was willing to accept just tens of millions according to a person familiar with the audit how did a case that consumed so many years of effort with a team of its finest experts working on a signature mission produce such a piddling result for the irs the schaeffler case offers a rare window into just how challenging it is to take on the ultrawealthy for starters they can devote seemingly limitless resources to hiring the best legal and accounting talent such taxpayers tend not to steamroll tax laws they employ complex highly refined strategies that seek to stretch the tax code to their advantage it can take years for irs investigators just to understand a transaction and deem it to be a violation once that happens the irs team has to contend with battalions of high priced lawyers and accountants that often outnumber and outgun even the agency s elite swat team we are nowhere near a circumstance where the irs could launch the types of audits we need to tackle sophisticated taxpayers in a complicated world said steven rosenthal who used to represent wealthy taxpayers and is now a senior fellow at the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and brookings institution because the audits are private irs officials can go to prison if they divulge taxpayer information details of the often epic paper battles between the rich and the tax collectors are sparse with little in the public record attorneys are also loath to talk about their clients taxes and most wealthy people strive to keep their financial affairs under wraps such disputes almost always settle out of court have you been involved in a global high wealth audit if so we d like to hear about your experiences email or on signal at 718 496 5233 but propublica was able to reconstruct the key points in the schaeffler case the billionaire s lawyers and accountants first crafted a transaction of unusual complexity one so novel that they acknowledged even as they planned it that it was likely to be challenged by the irs then schaeffler deployed teams of professionals to battle the irs on multiple fronts they denied that he owed any money arguing the agency fundamentally misunderstood the tax issues schaeffler s representatives complained to top officials at the agency they challenged document requests in court at various times irs auditors felt schaeffler s side was purposely stalling but in the end schaeffler s team emerged almost completely victorious his experience was telling the irs new approach to taking on the superwealthy has been stymied the wealthy s lobbyists immediately pushed to defang the new team and soon after the group was formed republicans in congress began slashing the agency s budget as a result the team didn t receive the resources it was promised thousands of irs employees left from every corner of the agency especially ones with expertise in complex audits the kinds of specialists the agency hoped would staff the new elite unit the agency had planned to assign 242 examiners to the group by 2012 according to a report by the irs inspector general but by 2014 it had only 96 auditors by last year the number had fallen to 58 the wealth squad never came close to having the impact its proponents envisaged as robert gardner a 39 year veteran of the irs who often interacted with the team as a top official at the agency s tax whistleblower office put it from the minute it went live it was dead on arrival most people picture irs officials as all knowing and fearsome but when it comes to understanding how the superwealthy move their money around irs auditors historically have been more like high school physics teachers trying to operate the large hadron collider charles rettig commissioner of the internal revenue service said if any group were auditing donald trump it would be the global high wealth team aaron p bernstein getty images that began to change in the early 2000s after congress and the agency uncovered widespread use of abusive tax shelters by the rich the discovery led to criminal charges and settlements by major accounting firms by the end of the decade the irs had determined that millions of americans had secret bank accounts abroad the agency managed to crack open switzerland s banking secrecy and it recouped billions in lost tax revenue the irs came to realize it was not properly auditing the ultrawealthy multimillionaires frequently don t have easily visible income they often have trusts foundations limited liability companies complex partnerships and overseas operations all woven together to lower their tax bills when irs auditors examined their finances they typically looked narrowly they might scrutinize just one return for one entity and examine say a year s gifts or income belatedly attempting to confront improper tax avoidance the irs formed what was officially called the global high wealth industry group in 2009 the genesis was if you think of an incredibly wealthy family their web of entities somehow gives them a remarkably low effective tax rate said former irs commissioner steven miller who was one of those responsible for creating the wealth squad we hadn t really been looking at it all together and shame on us the irs located the group within the division that audits the biggest companies in recognition of the fact that the finances of the 1 percent resemble those of multinational corporations more than those of the average rich person former irs commissioner steven miller tried to fix the agency s approach to auditing the ultrawealthy nicholas kamm afp getty images the vision was clear as doug shulman a george w bush appointee who remained to helm the agency under the obama administration explained in a 2009 speech we want to better understand the entire economic picture of the enterprise controlled by the wealthy individual it s particularly important to audit the wealthy well and not simply because that s where the money is that s where the cheating is too studies show that the wealthiest are more likely to avoid paying taxes the top 0 5 percent in income account for fully a fifth of all the underreported income according to a 2010 study by the irs andrew johns and the university of michigan s joel slemrod adjusted for inflation that s more than 50 billion each year in unpaid taxes the plans for the wealth squad seemed like a step forward in a few years the group would be staffed with several hundred auditors a team of examiners would tackle each audit not just one or two agents as was more typical in the past the new group would draw from the irs best of the best that was crucial because irs auditors have a long standing reputation at least among the practitioners who represent deep pocketed taxpayers as hapless and overmatched the agents can fritter away years tax lawyers say auditing transactions they don t grasp in private practice we played whack a mole said rosenthal of the tax policy center the irs felt a transaction was suspect but couldn t figure out why so it would raise an issue and we d whack it and they would raise another and we d whack it the irs was ill equipped the global high wealth group was supposed to change that indeed with all the fanfare at the outset tax practitioners began to worry on behalf of their clientele the impression was it was all going to be specialists in fields highly trained the irs would assemble teams with the exact right expertise to target these issues chicago based tax attorney jenny johnson said the new group s first moves spurred resistance the team sent wide ranging requests for information seeking details about their targets entire empires taxpayers with more than 10 million in income or assets received a dozen pages of initial requests with the promise of many more to follow the agency sought years of details on every entity it could tie to the subject of the audits in past audits that initial overture had been limited to one or two pages with narrowly tailored requests here a typical request sought information on a vast array of issues one example a list of any u s or foreign entity in which the taxpayer held an at least a 20 percent interest including any hybrid instruments that could be turned into a 20 percent or more ownership share the taxpayer would then have to identify each and every current and former officer trustee and manager from the entity s inception get our top investigations subscribe to the big story newsletter taxpayers who received such requests recoiled attacking the core idea that shulman had said would animate the audits their attorneys and accountants argued the examinations sought too much information creating an onerous burden the audits proceeded into a proctology exam unearthing every aspect of their lives said mark allison a prominent tax attorney for caplin drysdale who has represented taxpayers undergoing global high wealth audits it was extraordinarily intrusive not surprisingly these people tend to be private and are not used to sharing tax practitioners took their concerns directly to the agency at american bar association conferences and during the aba s regular private meetings with top irs officials part of our approach was to have private sit downs to raise issues and concerns said allison who has served in top roles in the aba s tax division for years we were telling them this was too much unwieldy and therefore unfair allison said he told high ranking irs officials you need to rein in these audit teams for years politicians have hammered the irs for its supposed abuse of taxpayers congress created a taxpayer bill of rights in the mid 1990s today the irs often refers to its work as customer service one result of constant congressional scrutiny is that senior irs officials are willing to meet with top tax lawyers and address their concerns there was help there they stuck their necks out for me allison said the irs publicly retreated speaking at a washington d c bar association event in february 2013 a top irs official james fee conceded the demands were too detailed and long telling the gathering that the agency has taken strides to make sure it doesn t happen again the global high wealth group began to limit its initial document requests the lobbying campaign combined with the lack of funding for the group took its toll one report estimated that the wealth team had audited only around a dozen wealthy taxpayers in its first two and a half years in a september 2015 report the irs inspector general said the agency had failed to establish the team as a standalone group capable of conducting all of its own examinations the group didn t have steady leadership with three directors in its first five years when it did audit the ultrawealthy more than 40 percent of the reviews resulted in no additional taxes loading the inspector general also criticized the irs broadly not just its high wealth team for not focusing enough on the richest taxpayers in 2010 the irs as a whole audited over 32 000 millionaires by 2018 that number had fallen to just over 16 000 according to data compiled by syracuse university audits of the wealthiest americans have collapsed 52 percent since 2011 falling more substantially than audits of the middle class and the poor almost half of audits of the wealthy were of taxpayers making 200 000 to 399 000 those audits brought in 605 per audit hour worked exams of those making over 5 million by contrast brought in more than 4 500 an hour the irs didn t even have the resources to pursue millionaires who had been hit with a hefty tax bill and simply stiffed uncle sam it appeared to no longer emphasize the collection of delinquent accounts of global high wealth taxpayers a 2017 inspector general report said in recent years the number of global high wealth audits has been higher it closed 149 audits in the last year but tax lawyers and former irs officials say even that improvement is deceptive a major reason is that the audits are much less ambitious they were longer at the beginning and shorter as the process moved on johnson the tax attorney said inside the irs agents seethed the whole organization was very frustrated gardner said they were just really not sure what the hell their mission was what they were supposed to be accomplishing georg schaeffler 54 has flowing salt and pepper hair that makes him look like he could ve been an actor on the 1980s tv show dynasty the impression is offset by the wire rim glasses he wears and by the bookish disposition of a person who as a teenager once asked for a copy of the german constitution as a present as a younger man schaeffler tried to escape his legacy he left germany and the family company at a young age and lit out for the american west he was trying to make it on his own where people don t know who you are as he would tell a reporter for a magazine profile years later some might escape to texas to live a bit wild schaeffler became a corporate lawyer schaeffler s law firm colleagues didn t know much more than that he spoke with an accent and certainly not that he was vastly wealthy that is until he landed on the forbes list of global billionaires rueful at the loss of his privacy schaeffler once declared i hate forbes the family s riches stemmed from ball bearings and other automobile parts manufactured by the schaeffler group which was founded by schaeffler s father and then passed to his mother after his father died by 2006 georg pronounced gay org owned 80 percent of the enterprise and his mother the remaining 20 percent as a texas resident at that time schaeffler was required to pay u s income taxes he very nearly lost it all in 2008 schaeffler group made a big mistake it offered to buy continental ag a tiremaker just days before the stock and credit markets experienced their worst crisis since the great depression even as continental s stock price crashed schaeffler was legally obligated to go through with its purchase at the much higher pre crash price schaeffler and his mother maria elisabeth ran into trouble after their family auto parts company acquired tiremaker continental ag in the middle of the financial crisis julian stratenschulte picture alliance via getty images schaeffler group flirted with bankruptcy and pleaded for aid from the german government the media began to pay closer attention to the private company and the low profile family that ran it german press accounts dismissed schaeffler s mother as the billionaire beggar for seeking a bailout and pilloried her for wearing a fur coat at a ski race while seeking government help no german government aid came the schaeffler group teetered and the family s fortune plummeted from 9 billion to almost zero amid the crisis over continental georg accepted his fate and took up a more prominent role at the company he s now the chairman of its supervisory board to pay for continental schaeffler group borrowed about 11 billion euros from a consortium of banks at the time schaeffler s lenders including royal bank of scotland were desperate too having suffered enormous losses on home mortgages they wanted to avoid any more write downs that might result if the company defaulted on the loans so in 2009 and 2010 schaeffler s lenders restructured the debt in a devilishly complex series of transactions by 2012 these maneuvers had caught the eye of the global high wealth group paul doerr an experienced revenue agent would head the audit eventually the irs discerned what it came to believe was the transaction s essence the banks had effectively forgiven nearly half of schaeffler s debt to the irs that had significant tax implications in the wealth team s view georg schaeffler had received billions of dollars of income on which he owed taxes the auditors view reflects a core aspect of the u s tax system under american law companies and individuals are liable for taxes on the forgiven portion of any loan this frequently comes up in the housing market a homeowner borrows 100 000 from a bank to buy a house prices fall and the homeowner under financial duress unloads it for 80 000 if the bank forgives the 20 000 still owed on the original mortgage the owner pays taxes on that amount as if it were ordinary income this levy can seem unfair since it often hits borrowers who have run into trouble paying back their debts the problem was particularly acute during the housing crisis so in late 2007 congress passed a bill that protected most homeowners from being hit with a tax bill after foreclosure or otherwise getting a principal reduction from their lender tax experts say the principle of taxing forgiven loans is crucial to preventing chicanery without it people could arrange with their employers to borrow their salaries through the entire year interest free and then have the employer forgive the loan at the very end voila no taxable income the notion that forgiven debt is taxable applies to corporate transactions too that means concern about such a tax bill is rarely far from a distressed corporate debtor s mind any time you have a troubled situation it s a typical tax issue you have to address and the banks certainly understand it too said les samuels an attorney who spent decades advising corporations and wealthy individuals on tax matters but the efforts to avoid tax in the case of schaeffler and his lenders took a particularly convoluted form it involved several different instruments each with multiple moving parts the refinancing was complicated and unusual said samuels who was not involved in the transaction if you were sitting in the government s chair and reading press reports on the situation your reaction might be that the company was on the verge of being insolvent and when the refinancing was completed the government might think that banks didn t know whether they would be repaid this account of the audit was drawn from conversations with people familiar with it who were not authorized to speak on the record as well as court and german securities filings the irs declined to comment for this story doerr did not respond to repeated calls and emails a spokesman for schaeffler declined to make him available for an interview mr schaeffler always strives to comply with the complex u s tax code the spokesman wrote in a statement saying the fact that the refinancing was with six independent international banks in itself demonstrates that these were arm s length commercially driven transactions the irs professionally concluded the audit in 2018 without making adjustments to those transactions and there is no continuing dispute either administratively or in litigation related to these matters schaeffler s lenders never explicitly canceled the loan the banks and schaeffler maintained to the irs that the loan was real and no debt had been forgiven the irs came not to buy that after years of trying to unravel the refinancing the irs homed in on what the agency contended was a disguise the banks and schaeffler had a mutual interest in maintaining the appearance that the debt hadn t gone away a person familiar with the transaction said but the irs believed the debt had in fact been canceled in the refinancing the banks and schaeffler had agreed to split the company s debt which had grown to 12 billion euros at that point into two pieces a senior loan to be paid back first worth about 7 billion euros and a junior piece worth about 5 billion euros schaeffler s income producing assets were placed into the entity that held the senior debt schaeffler was required to repay the debt according to a schedule and to pay a meaningful interest rate 4 25 percentage points above the rate his lenders charge each other to borrow money in short it appeared to be a relatively straightforward debt transaction the junior debt was another matter and its provisions would raise the hackles of the irs to begin with the entity that held the junior debt did not directly hold income producing assets there was no schedule of payments that schaeffler had to make on the junior debt he wasn t obligated to make principal payments until the end of the loan s term and it carried a nearly nonexistent annual interest rate of 0 1 percentage points above prevailing interbank lending rates plus an additional 7 percent per year which schaeffler could choose to defer and pay at the end of the term the banks attached two other provisions to the refinancing a contingent remuneration payment and a contingent upside instrument according to german securities filings the two additions called for schaeffler to make payments to the future performance of the company the irs and schaeffler s team fought especially over the contingent upside instrument its value was tied to the schaeffler group s future profitability just like a share of stock would be the irs argued that not only was this an equitylike sweetener to the banks but that it tainted the entire junior portion of the debt to the irs it looked like the banks had a claim on future payments from schaeffler but they didn t know when they d receive it or even if they would ever get anything to the irs these steps all added up to the effective cancellation of about 5 billion worth of debt for which the banks had received something in return that something looked and acted very much like equity the schaeffler audit was one of the biggest for the global high wealth group the irs assigned a larger than normal team to the exam the agency would send 86 separate document requests to schaeffler through july 2013 but there were problems almost from the beginning according to people familiar with the audit who provided this account and chronology the irs examiners disagreed with one another over strategy the debates sometimes spilled into the view of schaeffler s team i remember a tremendous amount of turnover from the exam team and infighting they were not presenting a coherent message a person in the schaeffler camp said by contrast schaeffler s team of lawyers and accountants was large and unified these taxpayers aren t exactly represented by h r block gardner the retired irs official said schaeffler s advisers threw as much as they could back at the agency document requests are typically voluntary at the outset but at one point an irs auditor was frustrated at what the team saw as the schaeffler team s resistance and delays and demanded would a summons help according to a person familiar with the exam schaeffler s team complained about the perceived threat the irs scolded its employee and doerr the lead auditor apologized to the schaeffler side according to the person the irs efforts to police the superwealthy have been a bust michael brochstein sopa images lightrocket via getty images in another instance the irs could not get information it sought from ernst young the accounting firm related to its advice to schaeffler so it sued the accounting firm in early 2014 ernst young contended the material was privileged because it was prepared in anticipation of litigation the irs won in the u s district court for the southern district of new york but ernst young appealed in early november 2015 with the ernst young appeal unresolved top irs officials gave the schaeffler audit team the permission it was looking for they allowed the auditors to notify schaeffler that they believed he d failed to disclose about 5 billion in income and that he could expect a 1 2 billion tax bill that included some 200 million in penalties because the agency viewed the transaction as abusive only days later the irs was dealt a defeat that would further hamstring its ability to press its case on nov

authored by josé antonio ocampo formerly united nations under secretary general for economic and social affairs via project syndicate this year the world commemorates the anniversaries of two key events in the development of the global monetary system the first is the creation of the international monetary fund at the bretton woods conference 75 years ago the second is the advent 50 years ago of the special drawing right sdr the imf s global reserve asset when it introduced the sdr the fund hoped to make it the principal reserve asset in the international monetary system this remains an unfulfilled ambition indeed the sdr is one of the most underused instruments of international cooperation nonetheless better late than never turning the sdr into a true global currency would yield several benefits for the world s economy and monetary system the idea of a global currency is not new prior to the bretton woods negotiations john maynard keynes suggested the bancor as the unit of account of his proposed international clearing union in the 1960s under the leadership of the belgian american economist robert triffin other proposals emerged to address the growing problems created by the dual dollar gold system that had been established at bretton woods the system finally collapsed in 1971 as a result of those discussions the imf approved the sdr in 1967 and included it in its articles of agreement two years later although the imf s issuance of sdrs resembles the creation of national money by central banks the sdr fulfills only some of the functions of money true sdrs are a reserve asset and thus a store of value they are also the imf s unit of account but only central banks mainly in developing countries though also in developed economies and a few international institutions use sdrs as a means of exchange to pay each other the sdr has a number of basic advantages not least that the imf can use it as an instrument of international monetary policy in a global economic crisis in 2009 for example the imf issued 250 billion in sdrs to help combat the downturn following a proposal by the g20 most importantly sdrs could also become the basic instrument to finance imf programs until now the fund has relied mainly on quota capital increases and borrowing from member countries but quotas have tended to lag behind global economic growth the last increase was approved in 2010 but the us congress agreed to it only in 2015 and loans from member countries the imf s main source of new funds particularly during crises are not true multilateral instruments the best alternative would be to turn the imf into an institution fully financed and managed in its own global currency a proposal made several decades ago by jacques polak then the fund s leading economist one simple option would be to consider the sdrs that countries hold but have not used as deposits at the imf which the fund can use to finance its lending to countries this would require a change in the articles of agreement because sdrs currently are not held in regular imf accounts the fund could then issue sdrs regularly or better still during crises as in 2009 in the long term the amount issued must be related to the demand for foreign exchange reserves various economists and the imf itself have estimated that the fund could issue 200 300 billion in sdrs per year moreover this would spread the financial benefits seigniorage of issuing the global currency across all countries at present these benefits accrue only to issuers of national or regional currencies that are used internationally particularly the us dollar and the euro more active use of sdrs would also make the international monetary system more independent of us monetary policy one of the major problems of the global monetary system is that the policy objectives of the us as the issuer of the world s main reserve currency are not always consistent with overall stability in the system in any case different national and regional currencies could continue to circulate alongside growing sdr reserves and a new imf substitution account would allow central banks to exchange their reserves for sdrs as the us first proposed back in the 1970s sdrs could also potentially be used in private transactions and to denominate national bonds but as the imf pointed out in its report to the board in 2018 these market sdrs which would turn the unit into fully fledged money are not essential for the reforms proposed here nor would sdrs need to be used as a unit of account outside the fund the anniversaries of the imf and the sdr in 2019 are causes for celebration but they also represent an ideal opportunity to transform the sdr into a true global currency that would strengthen the international monetary system policymakers should seize it

written by jim tankersley president donald trump on friday called on the federal reserve to cut interest rates and take additional steps to stimulate economic growth his latest attempt to put the traditionally independent central bank under his thumb advertisement speaking to reporters before traveling to the southwestern border the president once again criticized the fed s interest rate increases in 2018 saying they really slowed us down trump who is presiding over one of the longest sustained economic expansions in u s history also said the fed should do more to give the economy a lift including resuming a stimulus program that he opposed when it began under president barack obama trump s comments came on the same day the labor department reported strong job growth with employers adding 196 000 jobs last month his remarks also coincide with his efforts to install allies at the fed as he heads into a re election campaign that will largely be a referendum on the state of the economy while the economy is still strong and unemployment remains low the effects of the president s 1 5 trillion tax cut are waning and his trade war has begun to hurt some american industries as well as contributing to slower growth in china most forecasters see growth slowing this year though trump s advisers continue to see it speeding up advertisement but the president appears to be taking no chances on friday he escalated his previous critiques of the fed by pressing for it to resume the type of stimulus campaign it undertook after the recession to jump start economic growth that program known as quantitative easing resulted in the fed buying more than 4 trillion worth of treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities as a way to increase the supply of money in the financial system as the economy recovered the fed began to reverse that program slowly winnowing its portfolio of bonds in a process known as quantitative tightening advertisement well i personally think the fed should drop rates trump said i think they really slowed us down there s no inflation i would say in terms of quantitative tightening it should actually now be quantitative easing very little if any inflation and i think they should drop rates and they should get rid of quantitative tightening you would see a rocket ship despite that we re doing very well the labor department numbers signal a rebound from an unexpectedly lackluster february it was the 102nd straight month of job gains wages were also up with average hourly earnings in march 3 2 percent higher than a year earlier and unemployment remained low at 3 8 percent the president has become increasingly bold in his efforts to influence the fed which he and his advisers blame for economic growth falling short of the 4 percent annual rate last year as he promised he has repeatedly criticized his handpicked fed chairman jerome h powell and has described the central bank as a counterweight to his economic policies advertisement the fed raised interest rates four times last year to the current range of 2 percent to 2 25 percent drawing frequent rebukes from trump presidents typically avoid commenting on monetary policy but the fed has since diverted from what had been a steady march of interest rate increases in the face of stock market turmoil growing domestic and global economic risks and pressure from trump the central bank does not expect to increase rates at all this year and has cut its growth projections to 2 1 percent for 2019 as he enters the 2020 campaign trump is banking on a much faster pace of growth than the fed and most economists say is likely global growth is moderating with slowdowns in europe and china underway and there are signs of weakness in the united states where chief executives see investment hiring and sales growth all slowing this year and business economists say the risks of undershooting economic growth are higher than overshooting advertisement democrats denounced trump s comments saying they showed his disregard for the traditional independence of the fed and his desire to use its powers to help him win re election there s no question that president trump is seeking to undermine the long term stability of the economy and independence of the federal reserve to boost his own re election prospects said sen ron wyden of oregon the top democrat on the finance committee larry kudlow trump s top economic adviser said friday that the president was concerned about a global slowdown and wanted the fed to ensure the american economy continued to grow advertisement we are facing a worldwide slowdown you know recession arguably kudlow said in an interview on bloomberg tv europe is not doing well germany itself may be in recession that troubles us kudlow denied that the president was trying to infringe on the fed s independence and said he simply wanted it to keep things thriving we re not pressuring we re not going after their independence he said we just don t want any threats to this rebuilding reviving growing economy advertisement but in recent days trump has made it increasingly clear that he will do what it takes to keep the fed heading in the direction he wants the president said thursday that he planned to nominate herman cain a republican who abandoned his 2012 presidential campaign in the face of sexual harassment allegations and who started a political action committee to combat what he claims is misinformation about trump to a seat on the fed s seven member board trump also plans to nominate stephen moore an adviser and conservative economist who has become a vocal critic of the fed s interest rate increases those selections are a marked shift from his previous nominations to the board the president has tended to tap largely conventional candidates not loyalists or those with starkly contrarian views his choice of powell for chairman was seen as a vote for consistency on the fed given powell s approach was expected to be and indeed has been in line with his predecessor janet l yellen who called for a moderate pace of rate increases advertisement trump s three other fed appointments have also been fairly unsurprising richard clarida whom he appointed as vice chairman was a columbia university economist and a scholar in monetary policy randal k quarles who oversees bank supervision worked in the financial industry and at the treasury department in previous republican administrations and michelle w bowman was the state bank commissioner of kansas wall street analysts economists and at least one republican senator warned friday that trump s choice of political actors could wind up compromising the fed in a way that could be detrimental to the health of the economy in our view the selections could raise questions about the independence of the federal reserve and could be perceived as an attempted politicization of monetary policy researchers at barclays wrote in a note to clients adding the experience of each candidate does not seem to be the main reason the trump administration is considering their nominations advertisement sen mitt romney of utah who ran against cain for the republican nomination told politico that he would prefer nonpolitical appointees i would like to see nominees that are economists first and not partisans romney said it is unclear whether moore or cain who have yet to be formally nominated will be confirmed by the senate trump has previously faced pushback on two of his fed choices advertisement nellie liang an economist and financial regulation expert withdrew from consideration after financial industry lobbyists worked against her nomination and senate republicans made clear they would not vote to confirm her and marvin goodfriend a professor at carnegie mellon university and a former monetary policy adviser to the federal reserve bank of richmond virginia languished in the last congress after lawmakers questioned his previous views on inflation for now most senate republicans have said they will wait for confirmation hearings before determining their votes sen mitch mcconnell of kentucky the republican leader has remained mum on both selections for the fed but aides and senators close to mcconnell said he had made it clear he had no intention of moving ahead quickly with either nomination giving the president and his staff ample time to vet both men and consider other candidates

washington if you think you understand what s going on with the global economy you re probably not paying attention on the one hand the stock market is powering ahead since its recent low on dec 24 it was up 22 4 percent according to the wilshire 5000 total market index which measures the value of all publicly traded u s stocks that s a paper gain of 5 7 trillion asian and european stock markets have also rebounded on the other hand the real economy of jobs and production is slumping in the united states europe and china how can both be true maybe they can t a slowing global economy should weaken the profits of major corporations which in turn should reduce stock prices after all stock values supposedly reflect present and future profits but stocks are advancing not retreating something it seems ought to give either the real economy ought to catch up with the stock market or stocks ought to fall to match the weaker outlook for the real economy for the moment the economy can t seem to make up its mind uneasy about the economy s strength many economists have downgraded their forecasts just recently the federal reserve suspended interest rate increases fearing they might derail the recovery meanwhile stock indexes are trading near historical highs let s examine some numbers the peterson institute for international economics a think tank makes regular economic forecasts here are its latest projections for 2019 growth in the united states will drop from 2 9 percent in 2018 to 2 2 percent in the eurozone the 19 countries in the european union that use the euro the decline will be from 1 8 percent to 1 2 percent and china s growth will fall to 6 1 percent lower than its 2018 rate 6 6 percent advertisement economist karen dynan of peterson attributes most of the u s slowdown to the waning effect of the trump administration s 2017 tax cut other recent economic indicators signal weakness a paychex ihs survey of small businesses showed a decline in hiring during march after two months of no job growth similarly the census bureau reported that orders for durable goods industrial machinery oil drilling equipment turbines cars computers and the like were flat even after removing a decline of orders for boeing commercial jets one possible explanation of the economy s slowdown is that the global recovery has benefited from large doses of cheap credit loans bonds and other types of debt and that this torrent of borrowing is now receding although the forms of borrowing whether by governments businesses or consumers differ from country to country a broad credit tightening could undermine the worldwide economic expansion the rise in global debt slowed sharply in 2018 says a new report from the institute of international finance iif in 2017 worldwide debt increased by a staggering 21 trillion according to the report last year the increase was a much smaller 3 3 trillion this slowdown was mainly driven by europe and china the report notes but perhaps the global slowdown is only a pause and the buoyant stock market is simply giving fair warning of a stronger economy commentators have been complaining for years that stocks are overvalued and the market has repeatedly brushed those doubts aside corporate profits have been strong and the market is valuing every dollar of profit at a high multiple deserving of a rich stock price the average pe price to earnings ratio of the standard poor s 500 stock index has averaged 17 since 1936 according to howard silverblatt a senior analyst at s p dow jones indices now the pe exceeds a lofty 22 either the market is mad or it s gushing with good news robert samuelson is a columnist with the washington post send questions comments to the editors

the canadian dollar was stuck in a rut in overnight trading it wasn t alone the g 10 major currencies all opened in toronto today right around yesterday s closing levels there was a bit of to ing and fro ing but the trading ranges were narrow and well defined there are plenty of risk events occurring around the globe but current information about those risks is hard to find that is going to change and it could be as soon as this afternoon or friday morning the latest round of the u s and china trade negotiations are winding up today in washington hopes that a deal will be announced imminently increased with news that chinese vice premier liu he will meet with president trump this afternoon as per bloomberg the new agreement gives china until 2025 to fulfill commitments on commodity purchases also american companies will be allowed to wholly own businesses inside the country however the reaction to what should have been positive news was tempered that may be because trump believing himself to be a master deal maker is prone to incendiary tweets to extract last minute concessions he did it with the nafta negotiations and it worked so why not with china the british pound was lively gbp usd rallied to 1 3190 from 1 3150 on news that uk politicians voted to require the u k government to get a long extension to the brexit negotiations the rally quickly reversed when traders realized that the decision to extend discussions rests entirely with the european union and not the u k prices move lower in toronto trading this morning as talks heated up about the prospect of a snap election and the risk of a labour government eur usd traded aimlessly within a narrow band traders ignored a report that a group of german economists slashed their 2019 gross domestic product growth forecast to 0 8 from 1 9 the canadian dollar traded extremely quietly locked within a narrow usd cad range of 1 3340 62 it is supported the steep rise in west texas oil prices in the past week and it may continue to get support wti oil is underpinned by increased chatter about a china u s trade deal which raises hopes that it would jump start global economic growth if so the sanctions against venezuela and iran alongside production cuts by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries suggests that oil demand will outpace supply lifting wti prices further the canadian dollar continues to bask in the glow from the better than expected gdp data and suggestions that the bank of canada is not committed to a dovish monetary policy bias the currency could get a bit of support if this morning s ivey purchasing managers index data is higher than forecast rahim madhavji is the president of knightsbridgefx com a canadian currency exchange that provides better rates than the banks to canadians

for the west the year 2008 marked the beginning of a difficult period of crisis recession and uneven recovery for china 2008 was also an important turning point but one followed by a decade of rapid progress that few could have foreseen of course when the us investment bank lehman brothers collapsed triggering a global financial crisis china s leaders were deeply worried their concerns were compounded by natural disasters including severe freezing rain and snow storms in the south in january 2008 and the devastating sichuan earthquake five months later which killed 70 000 chinese as well as unrest in tibet at first china s fears seemed to be coming true despite hosting an impressive olympics in beijing that august its stock market plunged from its 2007 high of 6 124 to 1 664 in october 2008 in what amounted to a record breaking crash but the chinese authorities remained dedicated to their long term plan to revise the country s growth model by shifting away from exports and toward domestic consumption in fact the global economic crisis served to strengthen that commitment as it underscored the risks of china s dependence on foreign demand this commitment has paid off over the last decade many millions of chinese have joined the middle class which is now 200 300 million strong with an average net worth of 139 000 per person this group s total spending power could amount to over 28 trillion compared to 16 8 trillion in the united states and 9 7 trillion in japan china s middle class is already wielding that power china accounts for 70 of global luxury purchases annually over the past decade though per capita car ownership is only around half the global average since 2008 the chinese have consistently been the world s leading auto purchasers surpassing americans in 2018 more than 150 million chinese traveled abroad for china s authorities fostering the emergence of such a formidable middle class was a crucial strategic opportunity as liu he chinese president xi jinping s top economic aide wrote in 2013 the goal for china prior to the crisis lay in becoming a global production center achieving it would attract international capital and knowledge after 2008 china s strategic imperatives shifted to reducing debt risk and boosting aggregate demand while deploying massive economic stimulus to encourage domestic consumption and investment thereby decreasing china s vulnerability to external shocks as part of this initiative china pursued large scale infrastructure investments such as building nearly 30 000 kilometers 18 600 miles of high speed railway increased connectivity last year alone that railway network carried nearly two billion passengers facilitated much closer regional economic ties propelled urbanization and enhanced consumption substantially thanks to such efforts together with mergers and acquisitions to acquire key technologies and lucrative infrastructure investments in developed economies china s economy almost tripled in size from 2008 to 2018 with gdp reaching cn 90 trillion 13 6 trillion whereas china s gdp was 50 smaller than japan s in 2008 by 2016 it was 2 3 times larger to be sure difficult challenges emerged land and housing values soared with urban real estate prices rising so fast that many feared a bubble credit growth raised further risks overall however expansionary policies supported china s rapid emergence as a global economic power globally but china s leaders did not plan one crucial feature of this growth pattern let alone bring it about with industrial policy the consumption focused innovative industries that barely existed in 2008 and that are increasingly propelling the chinese economy today china is now the global leader in e commerce and mobile payments in 2018 mobile payments in china amounted to 24 trillion 160 times the us figure the state owned banks and petrochemical companies that were china s top ranking firms in 2008 have been surpassed by e commerce and internet giants alibaba and tencent internet and technology firms are now creating tens of millions of jobs per year meanwhile the performance of the manufacturing sector long the main engine of china s development and still the country s largest employer has weakened undermined in part by rapid wage growth the result has been a fundamental change in the structural composition of china s economy yet rather than exploring this shift which is not captured in traditional measures of gdp many economists have focused on trying to poke holes in china s growth narrative a recent brookings institution study for example estimates that china s economy is about 12 smaller than official figures indicate this does little good the changes china s economy has undergone over the last decade are sweeping unprecedented and essential the world would be far better served by an effort to understand them than by attempting to prove that the country s achievements are less impressive than they are

this article is more than 5 years old getty the headline question appeared in quora will the next recession be any different it s a good question so let s delve into all recessions have commonalities as well as unique characteristics before looking at the likely characteristics of the next recession let s take a look at history for common trends and possible differences and before that let s review the definition of recession the national bureau of economic research a private non profit organization is the widely recognized arbiter of recession beginnings and endings they say during a recession a significant decline in economic activity spreads across the economy and can last from a few months to more than a year similarly during an expansion economic activity rises substantially spreads across the economy and usually lasts for several years they also note that within an expansion a brief period of decline can occur and during a recession a brief rebound might happen and nber emphasizes the spreading of economic decline across sectors they don t use the label of recession when a single industry goes into a slump but that slump does not spread widely an example of such a non recession was the oil industry collapse in 1986 oilmen felt a severe decline and texans thought they were in a recession but other industries and other parts of the country were expanding quite nicely now for the commonalities in the post world war ii era the period i have the most knowledge of all recessions have been preceded by federal reserve tightening the fed s fingerprints are on every recession though in some cases other fingerprints are also present dr bill conerly based on data from national bureau of economic research and bureau of economic analysis now for the variations severity and length can vary the decline in gdp from peak of the boom to trough of the recession has been as small as 0 3 percent the 2001 recession and as large as four percent 2008 09 with an average of two percent length has been as short as six months 1980 and as long as 18 2008 09 oil price increases played a major role in the recessions of 1973 75 and 1980 james hamilton has found that oil prices rose before all post war recession but in some cases the rise was part of the preceding economic expansion and not necessarily a cause of the recession other contributing factors include the housing bubble and financial collapse of 2008 09 the buildup and slowdown of y2k spending along with the dot com bust of 2001 the drop in consumer attitudes during the first gulf war in 1990 the steelworkers strike in 1959 and so forth back through history now let s address the question of what the next recession will look like if we have a recession begin in 2019 or 2020 federal reserve over reaction will likely be a cause right now i don t see the fed making a big mistake but that s hard for even the best economists to see in real time the case i worry about the most is the fed leaves monetary policy unchanged through late 2019 the economy shows strength and inflation accelerates and then the fed decides it s behind the curve and slams on the brakes that is a story more about 2020 or 2021 than 2019 it is not my most likely forecast but it is my biggest worry global economic decline is possible but usually not severe enough to trigger a u s recession the asian financial crisis of 1997 was hardly felt in america today european economies are weakening with brexit throwing a monkey wrench into many businesses plans u s exports to europe though do not constitute a large part of our economy about 2 5 percent of gdp a severe recession in europe would not by itself trigger a recession in the u s though it would slow down economic growth financial crisis seems unlikely the stock market may seem high but a drop in stock prices by itself is not recessionary to get a financial crisis we need too much speculation and i don t see that happening some pessimists point to high housing prices but our actual construction is right in line with needs generated by population growth more on this in a later article so my best guess is that the next recession whenever it hits will a garden variety federal reserve over tightening recession new housing construction will be hurt the most car sales will drop business capital spending will decline then other discretionary consumer spending interest rates will drop first from market dynamics and then pushed down further by the fed and inflation will decelerate some consumers and some businesses have stable income and will decide that it s a dandy time to spend especially on interest sensitive purchases economic growth will spread across the economy and the recession will be over although the business cycle is uncertain one thing we can be sure of is that surviving a recession is more likely for businesses families and governments that take prompt action with a well conceived plan prompt action is critical but very hard psychologically cutting back spending is not fun and human nature is to delay but survivors don t dilly dally when times get hard and change is necessary plans that are well conceived are also crucial as panic driven actions are less likely to succeed plans developed during good times are not only going to be more consistent with long term strategy and values but plans already developed will be executed faster than spur of the moment ideas to survive the next recession whenever it comes and however it looks sketch out your contingency plans now

taxing the very rich it s a lot harder than it looks james joyner 56 comments jesse eisinger and paul kiel have a fascinating report at propublica titled the irs tried to take on the ultrawealthy it didn t go well it s based on the case of georg f w schaeffler a german born auto magnate and duke trained lawyer of whom i had not previously heard despite his having been the 30th richest individual on the planet a year ago he s now down to a paltry 96th in 2009 the irs had formed a crack team of specialists to unravel the tax dodges of the ultrawealthy in an age of widening inequality with a concentration of wealth not seen since the gilded age the rich were evading taxes through ever more sophisticated maneuvers the irs commissioner aimed to staunch the country s losses with what he proclaimed would be a game changing strategy in short order charles rettig then a high powered tax lawyer and today president donald trump s irs commissioner warned that the squad was conducting the audits from hell if trump were being audited rettig wrote during the presidential campaign this is the elite team that would do it the wealth team embarked on a contentious audit of schaeffler in 2012 eventually determining that he owed about 1 2 billion in unpaid taxes and penalties but after seven years of grinding bureaucratic combat the irs abandoned its campaign the agency informed schaeffler s lawyers it was willing to accept just tens of millions according to a person familiar with the audit how did a case that consumed so many years of effort with a team of its finest experts working on a signature mission produce such a piddling result for the irs the schaeffler case offers a rare window into just how challenging it is to take on the ultrawealthy for starters they can devote seemingly limitless resources to hiring the best legal and accounting talent such taxpayers tend not to steamroll tax laws they employ complex highly refined strategies that seek to stretch the tax code to their advantage it can take years for irs investigators just to understand a transaction and deem it to be a violation once that happens the irs team has to contend with battalions of high priced lawyers and accountants that often outnumber and outgun even the agency s elite swat team we are nowhere near a circumstance where the irs could launch the types of audits we need to tackle sophisticated taxpayers in a complicated world said steven rosenthal who used to represent wealthy taxpayers and is now a senior fellow at the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and brookings institution because the audits are private irs officials can go to prison if they divulge taxpayer information details of the often epic paper battles between the rich and the tax collectors are sparse with little in the public record attorneys are also loath to talk about their clients taxes and most wealthy people strive to keep their financial affairs under wraps such disputes almost always settle out of court there s quite a bit more about the specifics of how schaeffler and his team defeated the irs by maneuvering but i m more interested in systemic issues this is the key takeaway most people picture irs officials as all knowing and fearsome but when it comes to understanding how the superwealthy move their money around irs auditors historically have been more like high school physics teachers trying to operate the large hadron collider for normal people the irs is a bogeyman they simply have more expertise and resources than we can afford to bring to the table for the very wealthy though it s the reverse it takes a dedicated public servant indeed to work for the irs for a low six figure income if they have the talent to make ten or more times that working for the wealthy that began to change in the early 2000s after congress and the agency uncovered widespread use of abusive tax shelters by the rich the discovery led to criminal charges and settlements by major accounting firms by the end of the decade the irs had determined that millions of americans had secret bank accounts abroad the agency managed to crack open switzerland s banking secrecy and it recouped billions in lost tax revenue the irs came to realize it was not properly auditing the ultrawealthy multimillionaires frequently don t have easily visible income they often have trusts foundations limited liability companies complex partnerships and overseas operations all woven together to lower their tax bills when irs auditors examined their finances they typically looked narrowly they might scrutinize just one return for one entity and examine say a year s gifts or income belatedly attempting to confront improper tax avoidance the irs formed what was officially called the global high wealth industry group in 2009 the genesis was if you think of an incredibly wealthy family their web of entities somehow gives them a remarkably low effective tax rate said former irs commissioner steven miller who was one of those responsible for creating the wealth squad we hadn t really been looking at it all together and shame on us the vision was clear as doug shulman a george w bush appointee who remained to helm the agency under the obama administration explained in a 2009 speech we want to better understand the entire economic picture of the enterprise controlled by the wealthy individual it s particularly important to audit the wealthy well and not simply because that s where the money is that s where the cheating is too studies show that the wealthiest are more likely to avoid paying taxes the top 0 5 percent in income account for fully a fifth of all the underreported income according to a 2010 study by the irs andrew johns and the university of michigan s joel slemrod adjusted for inflation that s more than 50 billion each year in unpaid taxes the plans for the wealth squad seemed like a step forward in a few years the group would be staffed with several hundred auditors a team of examiners would tackle each audit not just one or two agents as was more typical in the past the new group would draw from the irs best of the best that was crucial because irs auditors have a long standing reputation at least among the practitioners who represent deep pocketed taxpayers as hapless and overmatched the agents can fritter away years tax lawyers say auditing transactions they don t grasp in private practice we played whack a mole said rosenthal of the tax policy center the irs felt a transaction was suspect but couldn t figure out why so it would raise an issue and we d whack it and they would raise another and we d whack it the irs was ill equipped the global high wealth group was supposed to change that indeed with all the fanfare at the outset tax practitioners began to worry on behalf of their clientele the impression was it was all going to be specialists in fields highly trained the irs would assemble teams with the exact right expertise to target these issues chicago based tax attorney jenny johnson said not shockingly they pushed back and sadly congressional republicans helped stymie the project the wealthy s lobbyists immediately pushed to defang the new team and soon after the group was formed republicans in congress began slashing the agency s budget as a result the team didn t receive the resources it was promised thousands of irs employees left from every corner of the agency especially ones with expertise in complex audits the kinds of specialists the agency hoped would staff the new elite unit the agency had planned to assign 242 examiners to the group by 2012 according to a report by the irs inspector general but by 2014 it had only 96 auditors by last year the number had fallen to 58 the wealth squad never came close to having the impact its proponents envisaged as robert gardner a 39 year veteran of the irs who often interacted with the team as a top official at the agency s tax whistleblower office put it from the minute it went live it was dead on arrival but some of the concerns were legitimate the means of overcoming the massive advantages that the super rich had were rather onerous the team sent wide ranging requests for information seeking details about their targets entire empires taxpayers with more than 10 million in income or assets received a dozen pages of initial requests with the promise of many more to follow the agency sought years of details on every entity it could tie to the subject of the audits in past audits that initial overture had been limited to one or two pages with narrowly tailored requests here a typical request sought information on a vast array of issues one example a list of any u s or foreign entity in which the taxpayer held an at least a 20 percent interest including any hybrid instruments that could be turned into a 20 percent or more ownership share the taxpayer would then have to identify each and every current and former officer trustee and manager from the entity s inception now arguably this is simply necessary i m by no means an expert on tax law or accounting but i m not sure how you d go about disentangling novel tax avoidance schemes otherwise but this is nonetheless a massive fishing expedition that poses substantial burdens on citizens it also essentially reverses the presumption of innocence forcing those being targeted to spend large sums of money to demonstrate that their business dealings are above board taxpayers who received such requests recoiled attacking the core idea that shulman had said would animate the audits their attorneys and accountants argued the examinations sought too much information creating an onerous burden the audits proceeded into a proctology exam unearthing every aspect of their lives said mark allison a prominent tax attorney for caplin drysdale who has represented taxpayers undergoing global high wealth audits it was extraordinarily intrusive not surprisingly these people tend to be private and are not used to sharing tax practitioners took their concerns directly to the agency at american bar association conferences and during the aba s regular private meetings with top irs officials part of our approach was to have private sit downs to raise issues and concerns said allison who has served in top roles in the aba s tax division for years we were telling them this was too much unwieldy and therefore unfair allison said he told high ranking irs officials you need to rein in these audit teams for years politicians have hammered the irs for its supposed abuse of taxpayers congress created a taxpayer bill of rights in the mid 1990s today the irs often refers to its work as customer service one result of constant congressional scrutiny is that senior irs officials are willing to meet with top tax lawyers and address their concerns there was help there they stuck their necks out for me allison said the result of this multi front pressure is hardly shocking the lobbying campaign combined with the lack of funding for the group took its toll one report estimated that the wealth team had audited only around a dozen wealthy taxpayers in its first two and a half years in a september 2015 report the irs inspector general said the agency had failed to establish the team as a standalone group capable of conducting all of its own examinations the group didn t have steady leadership with three directors in its first five years when it did audit the ultrawealthy more than 40 percent of the reviews resulted in no additional taxes the inspector general also criticized the irs broadly not just its high wealth team for not focusing enough on the richest taxpayers in 2010 the irs as a whole audited over 32 000 millionaires by 2018 that number had fallen to just over 16 000 according to data compiled by syracuse university audits of the wealthiestamericans have collapsed 52 percent since 2011 falling more substantially than audits of the middle class and the poor almost half of audits of the wealthy were of taxpayers making 200 000 to 399 000 those audits brought in 605 per audit hour worked exams of those making over 5 million by contrast brought in more than 4 500 an hour or in picture form they add the irs didn t even have the resources to pursue millionaires who had been hit with a hefty tax bill and simply stiffed uncle sam it appeared to no longer emphasize the collection of delinquent accounts of global high wealth taxpayers a 2017 inspector general report said in recent years the number of global high wealth audits has been higher it closed 149 audits in the last year but tax lawyers and former irs officials say even that improvement is deceptive a major reason is that the audits are much less ambitious they were longer at the beginning and shorter as the process moved on johnson the tax attorney said inside the irs agents seethed the whole organization was very frustrated gardner said they were just really not sure what the hell their mission was what they were supposed to be accomplishing i simply lack the expertise to have a strong opinion as to how long or short these audits ought be i simultaneously think people ought to pay the taxes they owe higher scrutiny is warranted towards people making more money and government shouldn t impose a higher burden than necessary on its citizens in enforcing its laws whether the tax code or any other interestingly schaeffer comes across as a somewhat sympathetic figure here in 2008 schaeffler group made a big mistake it offered to buy continental ag a tiremaker just days before the stock and credit markets experienced their worst crisis since the great depression even as continental s stock price crashed schaeffler was legally obligated to go through with its purchase at the much higher pre crash price schaeffler group flirted with bankruptcy and pleaded for aid from the german government the media began to pay closer attention to the private company and the low profile family that ran it german press accounts dismissed schaeffler s mother as the billionaire beggar for seeking a bailout and pilloried her for wearing a fur coat at a ski race while seeking government help no german government aid came the schaeffler group teetered and the family s fortune plummeted from 9 billion to almost zero amid the crisis over continental georg accepted his fate and took up a more prominent role at the company he s now the chairman of its supervisory board to pay for continental schaeffler group borrowed about 11 billion euros from a consortium of banks at the time schaeffler s lenders including royal bank of scotland were desperate too having suffered enormous losses on home mortgages they wanted to avoid any more write downs that might result if the company defaulted on the loans so in 2009 and 2010 schaeffler s lenders restructured the debt in a devilishly complex series of transactions by 2012 these maneuvers had caught the eye of the global high wealth group paul doerr an experienced revenue agent would head the audit eventually the irs discerned what it came to believe was the transaction s essence the banks had effectively forgiven nearly half of schaeffler s debt to the irs that had significant tax implications in the wealth team s view georg schaeffler had received billions of dollars of income on which he owed taxes the auditors view reflects a core aspect of the u s tax system under american law companies and individuals are liable for taxes on the forgiven portion of any loan while it s hard to be too sympathetic to someone born on third base schaeffler was a victim of a global recession it s strange indeed that having loans forgiven to avoid having to declare bankruptcy is considered income for tax purposes but it s a fundamental principle of our system this frequently comes up in the housing market a homeowner borrows 100 000 from a bank to buy a house prices fall and the homeowner under financial duress unloads it for 80 000 if the bank forgives the 20 000 still owed on the original mortgage the owner pays taxes on that amount as if it were ordinary income this levy can seem unfair since it often hits borrowers who have run into trouble paying back their debts the problem was particularly acute during the housing crisis so in late 2007 congress passed a bill that protected most homeowners from being hit with a tax bill after foreclosure or otherwise getting a principal reduction from their lender tax experts say the principle of taxing forgiven loans is crucial to preventing chicanery without it people could arrange with their employers to borrow their salaries through the entire year interest free and then have the employer forgive the loan at the very end voila no taxable income the notion that forgiven debt is taxable applies to corporate transactions too that means concern about such a tax bill is rarely far from a distressed corporate debtor s mind any time you have a troubled situation it s a typical tax issue you have to address and the banks certainly understand it too said les samuels an attorney who spent decades advising corporations and wealthy individuals on tax matters and returning to a familiar theme it s a lot more complicated when we re dealing with people like schaeffer but the efforts to avoid tax in the case of schaeffler and his lenders took a particularly convoluted form it involved several different instruments each with multiple moving parts the refinancing was complicated and unusual said samuels who was not involved in the transaction if you were sitting in the government s chair and reading press reports on the situation your reaction might be that the company was on the verge of being insolvent and when the refinancing was completed the government might think that banks didn t know whether they would be repaid this account of the audit was drawn from conversations with people familiar with it who were not authorized to speak on the record as well as court and german securities filings the irs declined to comment for this story doerr did not respond to repeated calls and emails a spokesman for schaeffler declined to make him available for an interview mr schaeffler always strives to comply with the complex u s tax code the spokesman wrote in a statement saying the fact that the refinancing was with six independent international banks in itself demonstrates that these were arm s length commercially driven transactions the irs professionally concluded the audit in 2018 without making adjustments to those transactions and there is no continuing dispute either administratively or in litigation related to these matters schaeffler s lenders never explicitly canceled the loan the banks and schaeffler maintained to the irs that the loan was real and no debt had been forgiven the irs came not to buy that after years of trying to unravel the refinancing the irs homed in on what the agency contended was a disguise the banks and schaeffler had a mutual interest in maintaining the appearance that the debt hadn t gone away a person familiar with the transaction said but the irs believed the debt had in fact been canceled which again points to both the ability of the ultra rich to shield themselves from taxes and of the government to claim that income existed when it doesn t appear to on paper it s next to impossible for ordinary citizens to understand the issues involved because they re just so different from our own financial circumstances for most of us income is rather straightforward we re paid a salary which gets reported on a w 2 even for those of us who have small businesses on the side it s not all that complicated we have income and expenses the latter can get a bit questionable but there are reasonably clear rules about such things people like schaeffler and their advisors are essentially making up complex transactions and the irs is trying to retrofit existing laws to fit the mold indeed reading through the exhaustive propublica report and despite my generous excerpting here there s a whole lot more in it i m not really sure schaeffler and his people did anything wrong let alone illegal i have often invoked edward s corwin s description of the constitution s invitation to struggle with regard to foreign policy the tax code is essentially the same thing people and corporations are naturally going to pursue every legal avenue for diminishing their tax liability in the leagues schaeffler and the megabanks who loaned him money play those avenues are extensive further in schaeffler s case and many others it s even more complicated than that the united states government naturally has a huge incentive to tax people like schaeffler but because their money is earned through a complex web of international transactions so do many other governments so naturally the wealthy are going to do what they can to not only avoid as much taxation as possible but position their taxable income in the most advantageous jurisdiction possible i simply don t know that it s possible for the irs to keep up or to know when the united states is getting its just share of the pie update see my follow up it s hard to audit the rich so we go after the poor

after an oval office meeting last month between u s president donald trump and irish prime minister leo varadkar trump took a hard line on trade with the european union we re going to tariff a lot of their products he said unless europe compromises on long standing trade issues after an oval office meeting last month between u s president donald trump and irish prime minister leo varadkar trump took a hard line on trade with the european union we re going to tariff a lot of their products he said unless europe compromises on long standing trade issues u s trade representative robert lighthizer responding to pressure from congress added that the trade agreement between washington and brussels would be a dead letter absent the inclusion of agricultural issues on the european side however trade commissioner cecilia malmstrom reiterated the refusal to include any discussion of agriculture in these talks moreover the european parliament failed to endorse the proposed european commission mandate for negotiations and both institutions mulled banning all talks until the united states rejoined the paris climate accord a position that french president emmanuel macron has advanced the french also blocked the adoption of a negotiating mandate in late march unless both sides reconsider their intractable positions and malmstrom gets approval to open talks an impatient trump could impose 25 percent auto tariffs such a move would likely put the already weak european economy into a recession and cause a breakdown in trans atlantic economic cooperation which has been a pillar of the global economic order since the bretton woods system was established in 1944 the eu enjoys a nearly 170 billion merchandise trade surplus with the united states of which germany alone accounts for some 70 billion in some part this represents trade benefits built up by europe over time as the united states assisted it in regaining economic vitality after world war ii which were never relinquished despite continued u s efforts over many decades this is certainly irritating to trump the eu maintains agricultural tariffs well above those of the united states and has employed restrictions on u s exports such as chicken genetically modified crops hormone treated beef and a wide variety of dairy products it maintains a 10 percent tariff on imported automobiles and parts subsidizes its commercial aviation sector deploys competition policy and threatens new tax measures to punish u s technology and financial firms it circles wagons around the auto industry in spite of its blatant cheating on emission standards it is slow to correct problems when the united states wins relief through the dispute settlement system of the world trade organization wto europe also has not been especially helpful to the united states in mounting a serious challenge to chinese mercantilist practices the u s treasury has put germany on its watch list for currency manipulation partly because it consistently runs a global trade surplus around 8 percent of gdp as a member of the eurozone germany can hide behind the easy monetary policy of mario draghi s european central bank which was recently renewed and the currency weakening effects of being in the same currency zone as southern european economic laggards germany also resolutely refuses to stimulate its weakening economy consistently running budget surpluses against the advice of the european commission european and german economic policy hence promises to exacerbate trade imbalances with the faster growing u s economy the united states has traditionally been tolerant of the eu s soft protectionism especially in the decades devoted to bringing europe back to prosperity and into the anti soviet bloc after world war ii and later to help convince the chinese to move in a democratic market oriented direction but in recent decades the costs of the growing trade imbalances on the industrial and technology sectors have led to a shift in thinking about the trade offs in a liberal trade regime and helped propel trump to the presidency the other serious trans atlantic conflict is over reform of the wto all sides agree that current rules fail to cover issues of great importance to the 21st century economy such as digital trade subsidized state owned enterprises and protection of intellectual property the rise of the huge mercantilist chinese economy is an important stimulus to agree on new rules since the george w bush administration the united states has also built a critique of the operations of the wto centered on its desultory pace of action and the judicial activism of its appellate body which settles disputes the united states the eu and japan have been working diligently since late 2017 to devise solutions to the problems of the wto but european unwillingness to recognize in a substantial way the u s critique of the appellate body overstepping its mandates and assuming rule making powers threatens this process as well the emblematic case of this overreach is the 2006 ruling invalidating the methodology for imposing anti dumping duties used by the united states and accepted in the negotiations establishing the wto since the appellate body will cease to be operational by december because the united states beginning under the obama administration has refused to appoint new judges to it the future of the wto itself may be hanging in the balance moreover the need for consensus on new rules has paralyzed the wto since its inception and has led many to question the effectiveness of the institution trump certainly does not help matters by constantly invoking the looming threat of tariffs while his proposed auto tariffs are a bad idea trump s frustration with europe can certainly be understood congress could help by limiting the president s power to use tariffs but needs to suggest alternatives to incentivize europe to act failure to bridge differences in the dispute settlement problem and agree on broader wto reform could result in the effective demise of this foundational part of global economic order unfortunately some eu leaders in recent weeks have further raised tensions by promoting subsidized industries as they did with airbus and contemplate doing for artificial intelligence and electric batteries in the guise of national champions

in the just concluded week the international monetary fund imf after its discussions with the nigerian government officials on the country s economic developments and policies said that persisting structural and policy challenges continued to constrain economic growth to levels below those needed to reduce vulnerabilities lessen poverty and improve weak human development outcomes especially in health and education thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe also in its 2019 article iv consultation with nigeria s report released on wednesday april 3 2019 imf mentioned that large infrastructure gap low revenue mobilization governance and institutional weakness continued foreign exchange restrictions and banking sector vulnerabilities dampened long term foreign and domestic investments and kept nigeria reliant on volatile crude oil prices and production the washington based organisation stated that given nigeria s current policies the outlook for its economic growth remained muted with risks tilted to the downside and in the medium term without strong reforms growth would only hover around 2 5 it projected constant gdp to grow at 2 1 in 2019 and 2 5 in 2020 oil gas sector was projected to grow by 4 4 and 6 1 in 2019 and 2020 respectively while the non oil sector was projected to grow by 1 9 and 2 0 in 2019 and 2020 respectively too the imf executive board s recommendations among other things include establishing a credible time bound recapitalization plan for weak banks and a timeline to phase out the state backed asset management company amcon elimination of exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices in order to remove distortions and facilitate economic diversification strengthening domestic revenue mobilization including through additional excise duties a comprehensive vat reform and elimination of tax incentives as well as phasing out implicit fuel subsidies meanwhile recently released report by the nigerian stock exchange on domestic and foreign portfolio participation in equities trading for the month of february 2019 showed that the increased equities market transactions was largely driven by higher foreign investors transactions given the significant inflows from both foreign and domestic investors which cushioned the negative effect of foreign investors outflows the local bourse rose month on month m o m by 3 80 to 31 718 70 index points in february 28 2019 from 30 557 20 index points in january 31 2019 further analysis showed that total transactions at the nation s bourse rose to n188 billion in february 2019 from n122 billion in january 2019 foreign transactions increased to n99 billion from n67 billion while domestic transactions increased to n89 billion from n55 billion foreign portflio outflows rose m o m by 97 80 to n55 billion and foreign portfolio inflows increased m o m by 91 24 to n44 billion in february 2019 on the domestic front institutional transactions rose m o m by 88 15 to n48 billion in february 2019 also the retail transactions increased m o m by 38 26 to n41 billion in the same period under review despite the favourable corporate earnings increased dividend payouts as well as moderated yields for most fixed assets maturities we saw the local equities plunge by 5 77 year to date reversing the 3 80 positive performance printed in february 2019 meanwhile analysts at cowry assets management say that the negative performance of local shares was due to political uncertainty amid the decision of the presidential candidate of the peoples democratic partys alhaji atiku abubakar to challenge the victory of the all progressives congress candidate president muhammadu buhari at the law court and the inconclusive elections which characterized the states elections nevertheless if fg implements more market friendly policies as recommended by imf executive board and strengthens revenue mobilization through increasing the tax base we should see the local bourse closing in green territory in 2019

loading and it s a pity we haven t started earlier because once we no longer had a vehicle manufacturing industry to protect then you would have thought we could start to raise our standard for vehicle emissions australia has become what many describe as a dumping ground for the world s dirtiest cars the result of poor quality fuel and a lack of any vehicle emissions standards putting us behind countries like china turkey and india the carbon dioxide co2 emissions intensity for passenger cars in australia is 45 per cent worse than in europe the national transport commission found a lack of incentives for electric cars means that they now constitute just 0 2 per cent of new purchases in australia yet they approach nearly half of all new sales in norway it comes as the united nations is warning that australia is off track to meet its commitment under the 2015 international paris agreement to limit the warming of the planet to well below 2 degrees celsius above pre industrial levels wood said that in order to achieve australia s emissions target the country must reduce pollution to around 146 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030 which is 22 per cent lower than the most recent projection for 2030 labor s clean car policy to help boost the number of electric car sales by 2030 labor wants half of government fleet cars to be electric by 2025 businesses buying new electric cars over 20 000 will get a 20 per cent tax deduction but it s not clear when this would kick in these changes which make up the final tranche of the party s climate change platform include a 200 million fund to roll out 200 fast charging stations labor also pledged to introduce the country s first fuel emissions standard in line with 105 grams of co2 per kilometre for light vehicles which is consistent with the us standards but behind the european union s technician norman bell works on an electric truck in dandenong south credit joe armao the standard would require car makers to increase their supply of energy efficient cars in australia to ensure that on average their car emissions do not surpass the new limit but the party held off on setting a date for this standard choosing to first consult with industry the move was celebrated by an array of green groups and the automotive electrical sector tony fairweather who is the chief executive of sea electric a growing victorian based business company that electrifies trucks said labor s promises were positive to see an electric waste management truck at sea electric s dandenong south facility credit joe armao sea electric and charging station companies tritium and jet charge are among the businesses labor hopes will help form a new car manufacturing industry fairweather who is setting up a factory in the regional town of morwell that will employ 500 people said he chose to invest in australia s green transport future despite the absence of subsidies because we ve got global expertise we see what happens in other developed countries and it s embarrassing the lack of support and incentives that a developed country like australia is offering every other developed market that we are in and even some undeveloped markets like thailand and indonesia have some form of electric vehicle incentives australia right now has none greens candidate adam bandt with an electric car credit ken irwin the greens said labor s policy doesn t go far enough and reaffirmed their call for 100 per cent of new car purchases to be electric by 2030 the liberals said the opposition had no plan for replacing the shortfall in fuel excise revenue and warned the emissions standard will push up the price of station wagons and utes by nearly 5000 the government has promised it will develop its own electric vehicle policy i don t know what tradies are going to do under labor s policies because there is no car that can do what they need to do that they can drive energy minister angus taylor said fuel excise research organisation bloomberg new energy finance estimated that the revenue loss in fuel excise could range from about 1 billion to 5 billion a year by 2030 in the scheme of things it doesn t break the bank wood said but noted that new road charges or taxes on charging stations were obvious revenue replacements the end result is there will be a cost there which you will have to pay for that people are not necessarily yet aware of half of cars to go electric is it achievable there s nothing scientific about that number wood said of the electric vehicle target it s a marketing slogan a hyundai ioniq at a charging station infrastructure australia has identified a nationwide fast charging network as a high priority according to wood the target alone is meaningless unless the vehicles are made affordable and adequate charging infrastructure is supplied to encourage people to buy them right now electric cars in australia are expensive and limited in range just four models are under 60 000 the cheapest is the hyundai ioniq hybrid priced at 40 000 charging stations remain relatively scarce melbourne has just 11 stations per 1 million people and sydney had 15 compared with 43 in new york 28 in singapore and 64 in london an analysis by mapping company here technologies shows in order for electric cars to make up 50 per cent of new sales the australian renewable energy agency suggested that the states could consider waiving stamp duty and car registration on electric vehicles it might seem implausible but consider that the act has removed stamp duty and applied a 20 per cent discount on registration fees for electric vehicles it now outperforms all other jurisdictions in its electric vehicle takeup other recommendations include abolishing the luxury

hopes to be selling electric cars in australia by the end of 2019 credit peter braig if we get it wrong we face significant potential costs by way of car price rises and petrol price rises he warned however government data shows that extra up front costs in purchasing fuel efficient cars are dramatically offset by the savings in fuel it costs just a few dollars to fill a tank at home while many charging stations on the street are free the australia institute s senior economist matt grudnoff said that until electric vehicles reach price parity this is expected to occur as early as 2024 they should be subsidised by the government the best thing we can do is subsidise early on and tailor it off as there is more and more uptake until eventually it vanishes we just need to overcome a market failure so that electric cars can compete evenly and the cheaper option will win out the power grid in his national electricity market review chief scientist alan finkel found a 20 per cent electric vehicle uptake could account for four per cent of grid demand a 100 per cent uptake could increase demand to 20 per cent as the cars become more popular a key challenge will be discouraging motorists from charging them during peak demand the australian energy market operator aemo has called for smart metering that allows for time of use tariffs finding that by 2050 one in three people using an electric car will choose to charge them during the busiest period at the end of the work day electric cars can produce less pollution if the electricity is produced by renewables toyota or tesla which one is greener taylor warned that electric cars can be the same or more polluting than some light vehicles he is not alone finkel also highlighted that the emissions released by a large tesla are just slightly less than a toyota corolla wood said these comparisons were literally true for electric cars powered by coal right now however he pointed out that as the country continues to invest in renewable energy the benefits of electric vehicles would follow

new york ap it s been a fabulous start to the year for investors as long as you ignore all those simmering worries about a possible recession s p 500 index funds are on pace to close out their best quarter in seven years having returned nearly 12 5 percent in 2019 through wednesday and many other investments from junk bonds to foreign stocks have also bounced back from their dismal end to 2018 but the returns would have been even better if not for concerns that slowing growth around the world may drag down the u s economy the quarter s twists are just the latest for the markets which have yo yoed from record heights to fear induced sell offs for more than a year the big swings have left stock and bonds looking fairly valued said frances donald head of macroeconomics strategy at manulife asset management she s optimistic markets can keep climbing this year but she anticipates more swings along the way when she talks with big institutional investors the mood is usually one of nervousness she says the 2020 recession calls whether they re right or wrong have permeated all individual investor mentalities she said the fed was again one of the market s main drivers and it flipped to hero from antagonist in the eyes of many investors file in this march 7 2019 file photo specialist matthew grenier works on the floor of the new york stock exchange the s p 500 index funds are on pace to close out their best quarter in seven years having returned tk percent so far in 2019 and many other investments from junk bonds to foreign stocks have also bounced back from their dismal end to 2018 ap photo richard drew file as last year was closing investors were worried that the federal reserve would raise interest rates too quickly and choke off the economy the central bank raised short term rates in december for the seventh time in two years and the s p 500 fell more than 19 percent from late september through dec 24 nearly taking down the longest bull market for u s stocks on record but on jan 4 fed chairman jerome powell told a conference for economists that the central bank would be flexible in deciding when to raise rates it was an immediate balm for investors and the s p 500 leaped 3 4 percent that day it kept climbing until hitting a peak on march 21 the day after the fed said that it may not raise rates at all this year all the while companies were turning in yet another round of blockbuster profit reports aided by lower taxes earnings per share for s p 500 companies surged 13 percent during the last three months of 2018 from a year earlier led by big gains for energy and communications companies but the momentum for stocks stalled last week when a surprisingly weak report on the european economy and other worries triggered concerns about the global economy investors sought the safety of bonds and that in turn triggered the alarm on one of the market s more reliable recession indicators investors drove the yield for the 10 year treasury lower than for the three month treasury bill for the first time since a little before the great recession such an inverted yield curve does not have a perfect track record as a recession predictor but it has preceded each of the last seven by a year or two here s a look at some of the moves that shaped the last quarter for investments stock funds soared during the fourth quarter swoon the s p 500 fell as much as 19 8 percent from its all time high set sept 20 the fed s pledge for patience helped the index rally back to within 2 6 percent of the peak this quarter technology stocks again did much of the work but the gains were widespread funds specializing in small stocks or large energy companies or real estate all logged gains the largest mutual fund by assets vanguard s total stock market index fund returned 12 8 percent for the quarter through wednesday on pace for its best performance since a 12 9 percent return at the start of 2012 stock funds that focus on high growth companies such as tech again easily bested their counterparts that look for low priced stocks called value funds the average mid cap growth stock fund returned 16 3 percent for example versus 12 percent for mid cap value funds value stock funds trailed partly because they often have lots of banks and other financial stocks which lagged during the quarter on worries that lower interest rates and slower economy will hurt their profits bond funds climbed as yields fell inflation is still low the fed is holding the line on interest rates and worries are rising about the strength of the economy all those help push up prices for bonds and pull yields down and bond funds of all types powered to gains during the quarter vanguard s total bond market index fund the largest bond fund by assets has returned 2 8 percent and is on track for its best quarter in three years the fed s patient stance was particularly helpful for funds that focus on short term bonds whose prices are more dependent on the central bank s moves than longer term bonds the average short term bond fund has returned 1 8 percent through wednesday according to morningstar that s more than triple the return in any of the prior seven quarters what s ahead like the global economy growth is also slowing for u s corporate earnings analysts say first quarter profits likely fell nearly 4 percent from a year earlier according to factset if they re right it would be the first decline in nearly three years that s setting the stage for some potentially disappointing reports when the next quarter opens on april 1 so investors may want to ready themselves for even more turbulence in the coming quarter besides earnings reports they ll also be getting more clues about the strength of the global economy and whether the united states and china can make progress on their trade dispute to help the global outlook
turkey s recent local elections were a repudiation of the justice and development party s akp stewardship of the economy voters also rejected erdoganism president recep tayyip erdogan s neo ottoman expansionist agenda that spawned foreign adventurism and alienated turkey from the united states instead of making hard decisions to fix the economy erdogan blamed the united states and jewish bankers for turkey s financial collapse its economy is officially in recession the turkish lira lost 28 of its value in 2018 and recently dropped another 5 against the us dollar on news that the turkish central bank used a third of its foreign reserves to prop up the currency during the three week period leading to local elections the purchasing power of consumers has dropped dramatically turkish businesses with debts denominated in foreign currencies are especially hard hit other economic indicators underscore turkey s economic crisis the official unemployment rate is 13 the highest in a decade youth unemployment is even higher at 30 inflation hovers at about 20 the economic malaise of voters is compounded by their concern over turkey s role in the world deluded with hubris erdogan wants to lead the sunni community worldwide he wants a caliphate with himself as the de facto caliph syria tops the list of concerns over turkey s adventurism regionally and internationally erdogan pledged to topple syrian president bashar al assad after chemical weapons were allegedly used to attack ghouta in august 2013 ghouta is a damascus suburb and was a stronghold of the syrian sunni opposition at the time working through turkey s national intelligence agency mit erdogan established the jihadi highway from sanliurfa in turkey to raqqa the isis capital in syria foreign fighters weapons and financing went from turkey to syria wounded isis fighters ended up in turkish hospitals with no paperwork or payment deluded with hubris erdogan wants to lead the sunni community worldwide he wants a caliphate with himself as the de facto caliph years later syria s grinding civil war continues three million syrian refugees have sought sanctuary in turkey despite promises of aid by the european union turkey bears most costs on its own instead of a principled position on regime change erdogan joined diplomatic efforts of russia and iran to preserve assad in power many turks are uneasy about an alliance with vladimir putin in november 2015 a turkish f 16 shot down a russian sukhoi 24 leading to a year long embargo by russia of turkish goods services and tourism today both countries pursue a transactional relationship to normalize relations turkey bought s 400 missiles from russia for us 2 5 billion us officials tried to dissuade erdogan from taking delivery the pentagon offered patriot missiles a better technology at a lower cost erdogan ignored the march 31 deadline to purchase the patriots in response the pentagon canceled turkey s participation in the f 35 lightning ii joint strike fighter program it will not allow its state of the art stealth technology to fall into the hands of russian military attachés working in turkey alongside the s 400s beyond suspending the f 35 program the pentagon is reconsidering its deployment at incirlik air base in antalya the symbolic and logistical hub of us military operations in turkey erdogan behaves like a carpet salesman to coerce concessions from washington he regularly threatens to cancel the six month lease agreement while reserving the right to expel us forces with 72 hours notice incirlik is not indispensable the united states is looking at alternative base leasing arrangements in jordan cyprus and romania erdogan s personal security detail is an embarrassment when the security detail beat us citizens in washington s sheridan circle congress prohibited arms sales to erdogan s security officers the united states may also ask interpol to issue red bulletins for 19 people who were indicted by a district of columbia grand jury for their role in the incident despite the rise of islamism in turkey a deep bond exists between americans and the majority of turks including kurds and secularists they are not comfortable with turkey s estrangement from the west nor do they approve of erdogan s mercurial relations with the european union the european parliament voted to suspend turkey s candidacy for eu membership based on concerns about freedom of speech and freedom of assembly protesters in istanbul s gezi park were beaten in 2015 despite police brutality and mass arrests demonstrations spread across the country turkey s democracy suffered even more after the coup in july 2016 erdogan labeled the opposition as terrorists more than 100 000 civil servants were discharged from their jobs and about 60 000 were arrested for purported ties to fethullah gulen a geriatric preacher living in the us senior officials from halkbank a state owned bank were convicted of money laundering to help iran evade us sanctions erdogan tried to suppress news of the trials in new york but information about turkey s criminal conspiracy leaked on social media erdogan s relations with iran s mullahs also draws an uneven response from many turks the united states issued a waiver so turkey could buy oil from iran however the waiver will expire soon turkey is expanding trade with china flirting with its belt and road initiative despite sovereignty and debt concerns erdogan identifies with a cadre of rogue despots around the world he recently affirmed solidarity with venezuela s nicolas maduro there are alarming parallels between the two leaders erdogan and maduro have shepherded the economic collapse of their countries as well as the systematic denial of democracy and human rights pocketbook issues always dominate local elections in addition to repudiating the akp s economic policies turks reject estrangement from the united states they are also uneasy with erdogan s fraternity with despots unless erdogan can fix turkey s economy and rebalance its international relations the rage of the turkish electorate may spill into the streets and result in his violent demise this article was produced by the independent media institute
it really should be a surprise that with one major exception republican economists haven t spoken out more about president trump nominating his adviser stephen moore to the federal reserve that s because unlike trump s previous picks moore is about as far from uncontroversial as it gets which is just a polite way of saying that while fed chair jerome h powell fed vice chair richard clarida and fed vice chair for supervision randy quarles were all the kind of obviously well qualified candidates that any republican or for that matter democratic president might have put forward moore is decidedly not he s an ideologue who as a longtime editorial writer for the wall street journal and co founder of the anti tax lobbying group the club for growth has much more experience with partisan politics than he does with monetary policy and it shows just consider the fact that moore went from saying that we needed to raise rates to fight nonexistent inflation under obama to now in what s a particularly conspicuous 180 saying we need to cut rates to fight nonexistent deflation under trump there are only two possibilities here either moore actually isn t able to tell whether prices are rising or falling or he bases his economic recommendations entirely on which party controls the white house which is why there is real concern that he wouldn t be anything other than a political foot soldier who would just vote to do whatever he thought was in the republican party s short term interests rather than the economy s long term ones that type of behavior when it has happened in argentina or venezuela has reliably led to higher inflation and weaker currencies and the problem is compounded by trump s other planned board nominee herman cain a reliable partisan with questionable qualifications advertisement it s enough that one of the most prominent voices in republican policymaking circles harvard economist greg mankiw who was george w bush s council of economic advisers chairmain from 2003 to 2005 before becoming one of mitt romney s top advisers during the 2012 campaign has publicly come out against moore s candidacy in particular he hasn t been impressed with what he calls moore s rah rah partisan style of analysis and as a result thinks that moore simply lacks the intellectual gravitas for the job at the fed other republican policymakers haven t been quite as vocal in their criticisms if they ve had any but reading between the lines it s clear that at least a few of them share a lot of the same concerns frederic mishkin a professor at columbia business school who was a fed governor himself between 2006 and 2008 told the washington post that first and foremost you want someone who actually understands the logical thinking of monetary policy in the job two ways to tell if they do he said were whether they correctly understood that you often have to be preemptive about raising rates and can t always just pursue economic growth and second whether they had incorrectly predicted that the fed s zero interest rates and quantitative easing were going to be very inflationary moore of course thinks the fed should be cutting rates right now even though unemployment is at multi decade lows and warned in 2009 that the fed s actions might spark hyperinflation the real question then is whether moore would be willing to learn how the fed works kent smetters a professor at the university of pennsylvania the faculty director of the penn wharton budget model and the deputy assistant secretary for economic policy in the treasury department from 2001 to 2002 told me that speaking for himself it seemed like moore had just been shooting from the hip when it comes to monetary policy and what he needed to do was familiarize himself with the topic enough that he could have a rational discussion about it and understand that there are truly tradeoffs involved that last part is especially important smetters said because moore s history of believing in free lunches in fiscal policy he s an aggressive proponent of the false idea that tax cuts fully pay for themselves means that you d have to wonder if he thinks there are free lunches on the monetary policy side as well in other words whether he s convinced himself that lower rates won t lead to higher inflation as long as the president is someone he likes advertisement now if all of this sounds harsh that moore just doesn t understand the subject that s because sometimes the truth is after all it was none other than moore himself who said that he faces a steep learning curve about how the fed operates that s what makes it all the more puzzling that more top republican policymakers haven t said anything about his nomination some of them such as douglas holtz eakin the congressional budget office director from 2003 to 2005 and later john mccain s top economic adviser during the 2008 campaign told me that they have a blanket policy against commenting on personnel decisions others such as glenn hubbard the dean of columbia business school george w bush s council of economic advisers chairman from 2001 to 2003 and one of romney s top advisers in 2012 told me they were too busy to say anything right now
officers and employees of k line group taking this opportunity of the 100th anniversary i the president and ceo of the company would like to make a speech on behalf of you all april 5 2019 is precisely 100 years after april 5 1919 when the foundation shareholders meeting of kawasaki kisen kaisha ltd was held a few years before that in 1914 kawasaki dockyard co ltd the predecessor of kawasaki heavy industries ltd which would become our parent started business by building and owning many stock boats in anticipation of rapid increase in demand for new ships following the outbreak of world war i however although this stock boat strategy worked well at the beginning it went wrong as the war ended earlier than expected resulting in an excess of ships taking this opportunity on april 5 1919 kawasaki dockyard established a shipping company through contribution in kind with 11 ships and three days after that on april 8 submitted the notification of commencement of business thus kawasaki kisen kaisha ltd took its first step as a shipping company now i would like to present an episode at birth of the company in the fifty years history of k line there is a description selling newly built ships overseas would only give profits to foreign shipping companies which was undesirable we believed that in the interest of japan s national development the company had to retain newly built vessels for use by japan and set up a large shipping company capable of rivaling nippon yusen nyk and osaka shosen the predecessor of mol to launch a ship operation enterprise our company was born taking advantage of adversity that is the excessive amount of stock boats and here i recognize the origin of the k line spirit under the k line spirit that is enterprising spirit broad mindedness and independence and autonomy taken from generation to generation since its founding k line has developed business and expanded operations overcoming a great number of challenges it was in a desperate situation when the pacific war dealt a devastating blow to the company s fleet and the lives of many crew members were lost by salvaging and reviving the requisitioned and half sunken kiyokawa maru as the main force to restore the company s business k line could overcome adverse circumstances after the war in the 1960s when japan went through rapid economic growth while the demand for transportation of resources and raw materials significantly rose as industrialization moved forward and improvement in living standards proceeded k line actively promoted the upgrade of the tanker fleet and building of specialized carriers for transport of iron ore coal lumber grain and so on when consideration was given to specialized ships enhancement of service quality and improvement of transport efficiency were always aimed at in response to the demands of customers and with a flexible mindset taking the field of transport of automobiles as an example until then car bulkers were generally assigned which secured the revenues in both directions by exporting cars from japan and loading bulk cargo such as grain on their way back however in the 1970s by building toyota maru no 10 japan s first pure car carrier designed exclusively for completed car transport damage to the cargo by conventional loading and unloading was largely eliminated in addition a dramatic improvement in service quality was realized by avoiding delays in schedule due to the waiting time for return cargo or weather in the field of energy transport in 1983 k line handled the first operation to transport lng by sea at minus 162 degrees celsius by bishu maru japan s first lng carrier in 1994 listening to requests by domestic power companies and in order to embody such requests the first wide beam shallow draft coal carrier corona ace was built which became the industry standard for thermal coal transport as for containership services by commencing the first intermodal transportation by double stack trains by a japanese shipping company in north america in 1986 and so on k line was nicknamed waresaki to be first kisen line by demonstrating its enterprising spirit and has always been trying to be the leader of the industry drive green highway which was built as an environment friendly flagship featuring advanced integration of various environmental technologies should be still fresh in your memory in the second half of the 1980s skyrocketing energy costs due to the oil crisis and the emergence of ocean shipping industries in developing countries happened simultaneously then further worsening the situation the plaza accord was concluded in 1985 which led to the rapid appreciation of the yen in 1995 an exchange rate of 79 yen to the u s dollar was recorded which resulted in the rapid decline in the international competitiveness of japanese ocean shipping companies including k line who had to pay the cost in yen and obtained the bulk of their revenue in foreign currencies since then we have been tossed about by declines in demand due to drastic changes in the domestic and international economic situation such as the asian currency crisis and global financial crisis caused by the lehman brothers bankruptcy when demand evaporated overnight we have suffered various hardships including the global glut of ships due to large orders during the shipping boom in the first half of the 2000s every time we faced difficulties while taking various painful measures such as emergency employment measures drastic business restructuring including business transfer to overseas offices and radical cost reduction we have overcome many difficulties with the officers and employees working together in the corporate culture of broad mindedness this fiscal year is the last year of the current medium term management plan revival for greater strides and we will continue focusing on the three priority initiatives which are rebuilding portfolio strategy advanced management and strategy and esg initiatives due to big changes in the business environment as a review of the business portfolio in response to such changes we spun off our containership business last year in order to enjoy the advantages of large scale business and to further enhance competitiveness by promoting business integration with two other japanese shipping companies on the other hand in domestic port transportation and logistics businesses the introduction of capital and knowledge from outside was promoted through collaboration with kamigumi co ltd and so on both of them were to proceed with selection and concentration with a clear vision to make the best of k line s strengths in addition as announced last month we are making efforts to improve cost competitiveness by structural reforms such as disposal of uneconomical fleets and sale of non core assets now this will be an important year to realize thorough concentration of management resources in four business pillars which are dry bulk business energy resource transport business car carrier business and logistics and affiliated business and their redistribution in order to strengthen our solid revenue base and to complete the rebuilding of our portfolio strategy the series of structural reforms we have been tackling are the settling of past investments and the introduction of sophisticated business management based on reflections in order to realize thorough risk management specifically k line s fleets and business risks will be assessed systematically by market performance over many years each investment will be evaluated by quantification by the same measure and realistic investments will be implemented by controlling the total risk in addition by proceeding step by step with the recovery of owned capital which was damaged by the structural reforms and with strengthening of the financial structure revival for greater strides must be completed in order to further consolidate the existing relationship with customers the corporate marketing strategy division and the ai digitalization promotion division were established also in the future we will be aware of our customers needs to realize convenience and improvement in quality of our services by coordinating them with advanced technology as for safety in navigation which is the basis of k line s service it is necessary to refine safe and high quality transport services by incorporating cutting edge information technologies such as utilization of big data and ai while making use of tangible knowledge cultivated over many years it is also important to give the utmost consideration to the environment and to take responsibility as a member of a sustainable society in order to promote the measures i have just mentioned while keeping our eyes wide open to take a broad view of the situation in this turbulent time we want to continue our efforts to gain customers perpetual trust as ocean shipment professionals who also are capable of presenting solutions backed by close preparations what we learn from the past is not successful experiences but the source of our predecessors ideas and their spirits always willing to reexamine and change their ways with a flexible mindset and daring spirit each individual improves one s own ability and work hard together with strong teamwork among the officers and employees of the group let s do our best together to enhance the enterprise value in an enterprising spirit and with swift actions so that we will be called waresaki kisen again finally today when the significant milestone of the 100th anniversary is marked taking this opportunity i would like to express my sincere gratitude to all the stakeholders including our customers business partners and shareholders who have given their continuous support to the k line group furthermore i would like to pay a tribute to our predecessors who overcame numerous difficulties to establish the solid brand of k line and to conclude my message by expressing the high spirit to make history in the next 100 years together with the officers and employees of the group taking pride in being a member of the new k line thank you source k line
loading and it s a pity we haven t started earlier because once we no longer had a vehicle manufacturing industry to protect then you would have thought we could start to raise our standard for vehicle emissions australia has become what many describe as a dumping ground for the world s dirtiest cars the result of poor quality fuel and a lack of any vehicle emissions standards putting us behind countries like china turkey and india the carbon dioxide co2 emissions intensity for passenger cars in australia is 45 per cent worse than in europe the national transport commission found a lack of incentives for electric cars means that they now constitute just 0 2 per cent of new purchases in australia yet they approach nearly half of all new sales in norway it comes as the united nations is warning that australia is off track to meet its commitment under the 2015 international paris agreement to limit the warming of the planet to well below 2 degrees celsius above pre industrial levels wood said that in order to achieve australia s emissions target the country must reduce pollution to around 146 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030 which is 22 per cent lower than the most recent projection for 2030 labor s clean car policy to help boost the number of electric car sales by 2030 labor wants half of government fleet cars to be electric by 2025 businesses buying new electric cars over 20 000 will get a 20 per cent tax deduction but it s not clear when this would kick in these changes which make up the final tranche of the party s climate change platform include a 200 million fund to roll out 200 fast charging stations labor also pledged to introduce the country s first fuel emissions standard in line with 105 grams of co2 per kilometre for light vehicles which is consistent with the us standards but behind the european union s technician norman bell works on an electric truck in dandenong south credit joe armao the standard would require car makers to increase their supply of energy efficient cars in australia to ensure that on average their car emissions do not surpass the new limit but the party held off on setting a date for this standard choosing to first consult with industry the move was celebrated by an array of green groups and the automotive electrical sector tony fairweather who is the chief executive of sea electric a growing victorian based business company that electrifies trucks said labor s promises were positive to see an electric waste management truck at sea electric s dandenong south facility credit joe armao sea electric and charging station companies tritium and jet charge are among the businesses labor hopes will help form a new car manufacturing industry fairweather who is setting up a factory in the regional town of morwell that will employ 500 people said he chose to invest in australia s green transport future despite the absence of subsidies because we ve got global expertise we see what happens in other developed countries and it s embarrassing the lack of support and incentives that a developed country like australia is offering every other developed market that we are in and even some undeveloped markets like thailand and indonesia have some form of electric vehicle incentives australia right now has none greens candidate adam bandt with an electric car credit ken irwin the greens said labor s policy doesn t go far enough and reaffirmed their call for 100 per cent of new car purchases to be electric by 2030 the liberals said the opposition had no plan for replacing the shortfall in fuel excise revenue and warned the emissions standard will push up the price of station wagons and utes by nearly 5000 the government has promised it will develop its own electric vehicle policy i don t know what tradies are going to do under labor s policies because there is no car that can do what they need to do that they can drive energy minister angus taylor said fuel excise research organisation bloomberg new energy finance estimated that the revenue loss in fuel excise could range from about 1 billion to 5 billion a year by 2030 in the scheme of things it doesn t break the bank wood said but noted that new road charges or taxes on charging stations were obvious revenue replacements the end result is there will be a cost there which you will have to pay for that people are not necessarily yet aware of half of cars to go electric is it achievable there s nothing scientific about that number wood said of the electric vehicle target it s a marketing slogan a hyundai ioniq at a charging station infrastructure australia has identified a nationwide fast charging network as a high priority according to wood the target alone is meaningless unless the vehicles are made affordable and adequate charging infrastructure is supplied to encourage people to buy them right now electric cars in australia are expensive and limited in range just four models are under 60 000 the cheapest is the hyundai ioniq hybrid priced at 40 000 charging stations remain relatively scarce melbourne has just 11 stations per 1 million people and sydney had 15 compared with 43 in new york 28 in singapore and 64 in london an analysis by mapping company here technologies shows in order for electric cars to make up 50 per cent of new sales the australian renewable energy agency suggested that the states could consider waiving stamp duty and car registration on electric vehicles it might seem implausible but consider that the act has removed stamp duty and applied a 20 per cent discount on registration fees for electric vehicles it now outperforms all other jurisdictions in its electric vehicle takeup other recommendations include abolishing the luxury car tax and giving electric vehicles access to bus lanes what you will pay the australian automobile association warned that penalising car makers for selling dirty cars risked pushing up vehicle prices chief executive michael bradley called for emissions standards that factor in australians preference for gas guzzling suvs and light commercial utes kia chief operating officer damien meredith hopes to be selling electric cars in australia by the end of 2019 credit peter braig if we get it wrong we face significant potential costs by way of car price rises and petrol price rises he warned however government data shows that extra up front costs in purchasing fuel efficient cars are dramatically offset by the savings in fuel it costs just a few dollars to fill a tank at home while many

vehicle uptake could account for four per cent of grid demand a 100 per cent uptake could increase demand to 20 per cent as the cars become more popular a key challenge will be discouraging motorists from charging them during peak demand the australian energy market operator aemo has called for smart metering that allows for time of use tariffs finding that by 2050 one in three people using an

the federal reserve s unrivaled influence on the world s economy is due in no small part to the belief that it simply doesn t care about politics the american central bank has proven that it s not scared to tap the brakes on the economy to prevent runaway inflation even if an election is lurking around the corner that track record creates stability in global markets and gives confidence to investors now president donald trump is putting that carefully crafted perception of fed independence at risk trump has repeatedly attacked the fed and has said he even considered firing its chairman who he selected more recently he announced two controversial potential nominees to 14 year terms on the fed s board of governors former trump campaign adviser stephen moore and former republican presidential candidate herman cain they would serve 14 year terms on the fed s board of governors trump s moves are seen by many in business as an effort to politicize an institution that to succeed must be viewed as and remain apolitical and that has consequences potentially serious ones the fed is not a place to put your cronies former federal reserve governor sarah bloom raskin told cnn business raskin who was appointed by president barack obama and served on the fed board from 2010 to 2014 said trump s attacks on the central bank and the selections of moore and cain run the risk of politicizing the fed when you undermine the credibility of the fed you reduce the effectiveness of an important way to bring about economic prosperity she said more suited to be talk show hosts trump complained about the fed againon friday and urged it to slash interest rates to speed economic growth i think they really slowed us down trump told reporters david kotok co founder and chairman of cumberland advisors fears that the fed s reputation on the world stage is being badly damaged he is politicizing the fed he s doing it in a divisive and destructive way kotok said i am very worried about trump s rhetoric and fed bashing the white house declined to comment trump kotok noted is not the first president to criticize the fed president george h w bush for instance lectured the fed about rate hikes early in his administration trump selected traditional individuals to join the fed much to the relief of wall street trump elevated the well respected jerome powell from governor to chairman he appointed pimco economist richard clarida as vice chair and named randal quarles vice chair of supervision and trump nominated kansas banking commissioner michelle bowman as governor but trump s most recent fed picks have veered straight into the political arena just as his attacks on central bank policy have escalated he goes from appointing boring competent people to people who are more suited to be talk show hosts than central bankers said david wessel director of the hutchins center on fiscal monetary policy at the brookings institution they say things that don t make any sense remember the 9 9 9 plan days after his name was floated moore a former cnn analyst and trump campaign adviser called for the central bank to immediately slash interest rates former fed officials warned that the move would be radical and counterproductive editorializing for a rate cut as a presumptive nominee is unthinkable behavior said kotok and cain the former ceo of godfather s pizza believes the united states should return to the gold standard as a 2012 presidential candidate cain puzzled many with his 9 9 9 plan which called for 9 income tax 9 business tax and 9 retail sales tax he has bizarre economic views the whole nine nine nine thing didn t add up to anything said wessel who is a contributing correspondent to the wall street journal cain does have business experience and even did a stint at the fed he previously served as chairman of the kansas city federal reserve bank cain passes my test kotok said but even some republicans expressed skepticism about the wisdom of adding cain to the fed if herman cain were on the fed you d know the interest rate would soon be 9 9 9 utah senator mitt romneytold politico on thursday romney added that he doubts cain will ultimately be nominated neither moore nor cain responded to requests for comment dissenting voices both moore and cain have altered theirformer views on fed policyto more closely align with trump s according to barclays chief us economist michael gapen these easy money policies stand in contrast to the hard money views both had expressed in recent years gapen wrote in a report titled the beginning of the politicization of the fed of course moore and cain would be just two voices on a committee of 19 their voices would presumably get shouted down by the more mainstream picks that means even if moore and cain make it to the fed they may not be able to affect the central bank s actions however raskin the former fed governor warned it s rare to have multiple dissenting votes such disagreement can confuse investors by weakening the central bank s message bond market revolt would hit economy trump s attacks on the fed could represent a political tactic by the white house if the economy stumbles heading into the 2020 election or if markets tank trump can simply pin the blame on an institution that won t fight back the federal reserve the underlying economy is not as strong as people may think said raskin if he is insightful enough to look beyond markets then i think he could very well see that he needs a fall guy and that could very well be the fed but that could backfire economically if investors fear the fed doesn t have the spine to fight inflation by raising rates long term rates will rise higher than they would otherwise be wessel said that would lift borrowing costs on everything from mortgages to auto loans and slow the economy and stock market down there is a price to pay for undermining the credibility of the federal reserve wessel said trump s attacks on the fed might be a smart short term political strategy but in the long run they could end up hurting trump where it hurts the most the economy

washington a month ago many economists fretted that the 10 year u s expansion looked wobbly but after the government reported friday that hiring rebounded in march the economy suddenly looks sturdy again growth has weakened since last year to something closer to the modest pace that has prevailed for most of the nearly decade long expansion the jolt from the trump administration s 2017 tax cuts and greater government spending last year has faded and the global economy has swiveled from a driver of the u s economy to a headwind yet last month s solid job gain of 196 000 may also help undercut any lingering fears that a recession might arrive over the next year or so the economy s slow but steady pace of growth is likely to keep inflation low and perhaps sustain the expansion which is set to become the longest on record in july by historical measures the expansion has fallen short of the sometimes explosive growth that businesses and workers enjoyed in the past but that often led to financial bubbles or economic excesses and eventually a recession lackluster means that you re not overheating josh wright chief economist at recruiting software maker icims said of the current expansion it s more stable and we ll have fewer imbalances it looks like we ll be able to prolong this recovery even further in its monthly jobs report friday the government also said the unemployment rate remained near a five decade low of 3 8 in march so far this year job growth has averaged a decent 180 000 a month that is down though from last year s 223 000 monthly average and it marks the lowest three month average gain since november 2017 before the tax cuts took effect wage growth also slipped a bit in march with average hourly pay increasing 3 2 from a year earlier that is down from february s year over year gain of 3 4 the best in a decade today s data paint a picture of resilient u s demand that has stepped down to a more moderate pace of growth following last year s robust gains said jonathan millar senior economist at barclays investors took friday s jobs data in stride the stock market was up slightly in afternoon trading extending a rally that has lifted the financial markets this year given that that hiring and wage growth aren t growing so fast as to threaten high inflation the federal reserve is likely to stay on the sidelines indefinitely forgoing interest rate hikes economists said as recently as december fed officials had forecast that they would raise rates twice this year but in march after financial markets turned volatile inflation showed signs of slipping and concerns grew about the global economy the fed said it would likely keep rates unchanged in 2019 yet the jobs data also provides little reason for the fed to cut rates analysts said despite president donald trump s repeated calls for the fed to do just that on friday trump went further urging the fed to renew the bond buying program it had used to lower longer term borrowing rates earlier this decade after the great recession the program was known as quantitative easing our country s doing unbelievably well economically trump said but fed policymakers really slowed us down and if they dropped rates and resumed buying bonds you would see a rocket ship quantitative easing was an emergency tool that the fed under chairman ben bernanke used to buy trillions in government bonds and other securities the third and last round was launched in 2012 when the unemployment rate was still 8 the fed s policies probably contributed to another shortcoming of the current expansion it has benefited wealthier americans more than others that s because the fed s qe program by holding down rates on treasury securities led many investors to put more money into stocks raising their values the stock market has tripled since bottoming a decade ago benefiting the richest one tenth of americans who own about 80 of the value of u s shares home equity a much more vital source of wealth for the middle class has recovered much less and many households remain gripped by financial insecurity despite the steady pace of hiring forty percent of workers earn less than 16 an hour according to government data analyzed by the economic policy institute in march hiring did pick up in higher paying sectors such as professional and business services which added 37 000 jobs in engineering it services accounting and other fields manufacturers did not fare as well cutting 6 000 jobs the sector s first decline in a year and a half mostly because of layoffs by general motors construction firms added 16 000 jobs one factor that may weigh on hiring in the coming months is a dwindling supply of workers in the healthiest job markets charles dunlap who owns an accounting firm in houston with a partner has found it much harder to find a new bookkeeper than he did the last time he filled the position in late 2016 back then advertising mostly by word of mouth turned up unsolicited requests for interviews and candidates with advanced degrees now dunlap has interviewed only three potential hires this year despite raising the job s starting pay about 2 an hour to roughly 15 that s the big challenge these days just finding staff dunlap said like hiring growth is also expected to decelerate this year to about a 2 25 pace down from 2 9 in 2018 the fastest expansion in three years in the much more rapid expansion in the 1990s growth topped 4 for four years consumers have helped drag down growth with retail sales falling in february and a broader measure of consumer spending slipped in january businesses have also reined in their spending on industrial machinery and other equipment and on factories and other buildings and in europe and asia weaker economies have reduced demand for u s exports europe is on the brink of recession with its factories shrinking in march at the fastest pace in six years according to a private survey still most analysts expect the u s economy to survive weakness overseas the u s is much more isolated from those factors than other countries millar said we have a relatively closed economy corporate profits also appear to be rebounding after stalling out in the first three months of this year analysts expect s p 500 companies to report a drop of nearly 4 percent in their first quarter earnings per share from a year earlier according to factset it would be the first decline in nearly three years but steve chiavarone an equity strategist at federated investors pointed to encouraging reports recently on china s economy and u s manufacturing along with central banks around the world easing up on interest rates over the last few days you ve seen 2019 and 2020 earnings estimates rise for the first time

nairaland forum nairaland general politics time to break deadly conspiracy against ajaokuta steel co 390 views inside apc is there another conspiracy against tinubu by buhari s men osun rerun we will resist any form of conspiracy against adeleke kwankwaso wa plateau crisis conspiracy against federal govt bauchi can 2 3 4 1 reply go down ajaokuta steel for the first time in history 301 legislators collectively sponsored a bill to fund a speedy completion of ajaokuta steel project attached the national assembly saw this project as a critical economic aid in eradicating poverty by creating thousands of jobs generating revenue for kogi state and nigeria at large the amount recommended was 1b the application of the money was amongst others for construction improvement extension acquisitions compensation of host community lands etc additionally the money was to cover surveys research and preparatory investigations inter alia the disbursement of the funds was to be applied by the minister of solid minerals that upon completion and successful operation of ajaokuta steel complex if the federal government insisted on its concession the law on privatization shall be followed judiciously to avoid illegal pitfalls thereby shortchanging the country most importantly is the 6 months imprisonment option for anyone who commits an offense against the completion of ajaokuta steel company by going contrary to the provisions of the completion bill however president buhari s rejected the bill for the following reasons 1 ajaokuta steel project is not important enough now he wrote appropriating 1 billion from the excess crude account is not the best strategic option for nigeria at this time of budgetary constraints and the nation cannot afford to commit such an amount amid competing priorities bare in mind nigeria is building a 2 billion refinery in katsina getting crude all the way from niger nigeria is also undergoing a 3 billion seismic expedition in search from oil in lake chad basin other areas we are also seeking to fund a 12 billion rail project from port harcourt to maiduguri the federal government recently took 1 billion for the purchase of military equipments to fight biko haram meanwhile our armies are complaining of having obsolete or no ammunitions so i think pmb is right we have so many other more important projects of competing priorities than to industrialize nigeria our pmb added that 2 the excess crude account funds belong to the federation it would be proper to consult with the national economic council and the states and relevant stakeholders the ministry of mines and steel development and the ministry of industry trade and investment were not fully consulted the inputs of key stakeholders are necessary to create the optimal legal and regulatory framework as well as the institutional mechanism to adequately regulate the steel sector meaning the excess crude account belongs to nigerians and the deliberations by the entire national assembly 306 representatives and 109 senators in addition to several public hearings and brainstorming sessions by ad hoc committee on ajaokuta s revival which had the ministers professional and host communities stakeholders in attendance was not good enough i shall make my concluding observations in my next post have a good evening natasha h akpoti the people s senator sdp mattersarising time to break deadly conspiracy against ajaokuta steel company by natasha hadiza akpoti i have been advised to use pseudo names in publishing this piece but that s not my nature i am one who bolds up to situations and thus i shall bear my name and consequences this report might stir from the 14th of august 2015 the day i had an interactive and empowerment session with the black smiths of ebiraland the pains in their voices daunted me a people whose ancestors carved a niche in ironworks way back as the 7th century suffered for want of materials to support their trade while a steel giant lay raped in their backyard by a series of unfortunate events and conspiracies in october i took online to issue a petition pleading with president buhari to revive ascl and with your support we were able to get hundreds of signatures since that day i left no stone unturned to discover the happenings so as to better understand the best path forward i have taken time to make this report as brief and as simple as possible and urge you all to take time and read 1958 to 1979 1958 the colonial administration conducted a feasibility study on iron ore deposits in nigeria 1967 the united nations industrial development organisation survey identified nigeria as a potential steel market which led to the signing of a bilateral agreement between soviet union and nigeria 1971 the nigerian steel development authority was established by decree no 9 to bring to reality a steel plant 1979 during the administration of alhaji shehu shagari tyazhpromexport tpe a russian leading engineering company commenced construction works on ajaokuta steel company limited 1979 to 1994 in less than 12 years tpe transformed a wide expanse of land to contain some giant size network of machinery meant to process the exploration of steel for nigeria indeed billions were spent and its evident in the state of the art townships roads bridges power plants air strip port rail that were put up in itakpe and ajaokuta in kogi state in 1990 as the project approached completion tpe on monthly bases for 4 years wrote to the federal government reminders on the need to commence works on the necessary infrastructure needed to successfully operate ascl and nigerian iron ore mining company niomco they are access roads to the mines and rail system from ascl to onne sea port in port harcourt tpe also suggested the possibility of dredging river niger which could offer a better and more convenient route of importing raw materials this infrastructure tpe argued would benefit the public especially northern part of nigeria where finished steel manufactured products such as cars parts construction materials etc could be shipped to other states and nations once the state is fully functional as an industrial hub the government never responded the international conspiracies a lot of people talk about the international conspiracies surrounding ascl but very few know what actually they were or are here in 1992 when the project was near completion and while the russians tpe called on the government to work on needed infrastructure powerful countries namely france america germany britain etc including the organizations like the world bank and international monetary fund imf started reaching out to nigerian government to terminate the project with the russians the ohinoyi of ebira land hrm ado ibrahim witnessed firsthand a plot by the imf during a conference in newyork where a team of nigerian officials and foreign agents connived that ascl should be completely dismantled and forgotten to them nigeria did not need to have a steel plant nigeria could as well buy steel from them if needed for its development nigerian government listened to the negative solutions without ever considering the true intentions of the so called experts from these powerful foreign countries russia all through stood its ground alone against france america and co and kept on reminding nigeria of the need to ignore the adverse opinions russia told nigeria that this conspiracy was cooked by the west to stop nigeria from achieving the economic strength strong enough to uplift not only itself but the whole of africa to them nigeria and africa needed to be kept as a market for all junk goods from the west this is in line with the colonial economic model brought in by the british and so to have nigeria turn around its economy and that of weaker nations hitherto being exploited by the super powers and by implication impact negatively on the extent of influence of the richer countries sent shivers at the smart future awaiting nigeria nigeria s government was too busy focusing on ushering the 3rd republic june 12 saga and all no attention was given to the russians tpe was no longer being paid in 1994 tpe left nigeria the international conspiracies a lot of people talk about the international conspiracies surrounding ascl but very few know what actually they were or are here in 1992 when the project was near completion and while the russians tpe called on the government to work on needed infrastructure powerful countries namely france america germany britain etc including the

witnessed firsthand a plot by the imf during a conference in newyork where a team of nigerian officials and foreign agents connived that ascl should be completely dismantled and forgotten to them nigeria did not need to have a steel plant nigeria could as well buy steel from them if needed for its development nigerian government listened to the negative solutions without ever considering the true intentions of the so called experts from these powerful foreign countries russia all through stood its ground alone against france america and co and kept on reminding nigeria of the need to ignore the adverse opinions russia told nigeria that this conspiracy was cooked by the west to stop nigeria from achieving the economic strength strong enough to uplift not only itself but the whole of africa to them nigeria and africa needed to be kept as a market for all junk goods from the west this is in line with the colonial economic model brought in by the british and so to have nigeria turn around its economy and that of weaker nations hitherto being exploited by the super powers and by implication impact negatively on the extent of influence of the richer countries sent shivers at the smart future awaiting nigeria nigeria s government was too busy focusing on ushering the 3rd republic june 12 saga and all no attention was given to the russians tpe was no longer being paid in 1994 tpe left nigeria series of unfortunate events the dept buy back nigeria s contract with tpe was to construct ascl for five billion german deutschmarks dm and such that the nigerian steel authority gave tpe promissory notes guaranteeing payment to the company when nigerian government suspended payment and tpe left tpe sold off these instruments to recover some of the debt owed to the company in october 1995 a series of secret debt buy back transactions took place whereby the debt instruments were sold at inflated prices to liberian companies purportedly owned by the abachas parnar shipping corporation and mecosta securities this involved the withdrawal in 1996 of 2 5 bn of public funds to settle debts owed to russia for the construction of the ajaokuta steel plant but which in reality had been discounted to only 500m obasanjo in 1999 settled debt through ompadec solgas the first concessionaire in 2003 nigeria under president obasanjo realized the need to complete ajaokuta and so solgas an american company which specialized in petroleum was given concession for a year and a half solgas zero progress raised questions as to their technical capacity to operate ascl even though they claimed senator liyel imoke and gbenga obasanjo brought in global steel holdings limited ispat to short change it from performing to this end nigeria terminated contracts with solgas there were no minutes recorded to document deliberations engaging or terminating with solgas global steel holdings limited indian the second concessionaire an indian company first operating under the name ispat then changed its name to global infrastructure holding limited and now global steel holdings gsh were helped into nigeria by sen liyle imoke and gbenga obasanjo under president obasanjo s tenure in august 2004 the agreement was such that company would own 60 percent of the shares of the steel mill the federal government would keep 30 percent while 10 percent shares would be sold to the public this company gshl owned by mr primod mittal is not affiliated with arcelormittal which the world s renowned steel giant arcelormittal is owned by lakshmi mittal and a cousin to mr primod mittal this concession which saw the taking over of ascl and itakpe is termed one of the biggest scams the plant was hugely undervalued for 300m and gsh was to pay nothing to the government but inject its funds to revive the plant with a number of conditions some of which were 1 that the federal government should give gshl two oil blocks 2 that gshl be allowed to be lifting crude oil from nigeria 3 that the sapele power plant be given to gshl to operate 4 concession of delta and warri ports to gshl to operate 10 the supply of natural gas to gshl at competitive and reasonable tariff gshl came up with this condition after it failed to sign a gas supply agreement with the nigeria liquefied natural gas company gshl offered to pay n5 00 per cubic meter of gas as against the market price of n30 00 it also inserted in its conditions that gas price should be kept reasonable and consistent after all these conditions ascl still deteriorated as equipments of ascl were moved to delta steel which gshl took over in 2005 while some to other private owned indian owned steel factories in nigeria in the name of borrowing the federal government under president yaradua realized the huge mistake nigeria once again made and sought to terminate the contract with gshl the then director general of the bpe ms bolanle onagoruwa stressed that the approval of the concession of ajaokuta by president obasanjo was in violation of the bpe act at senator ahmed lawan led adhoc committee minister of mines and steel development architect mohammed musa sada also revealed that the federal government under obasanjo single handedly sold ascl to gshl and that gshl ruined the ajaokuta complex by stripping it of all valuable equipment and machineries it led to the cancellation of the entire process by the federal government this act didn t go too well with gshl and they dragged nigeria to the international chamber of commerce icc in london uk and demanded nigeria pays them 1b for termination in 2013 after 6 years of heated negotiations at the icc the jonathan s administration successfully took back ascl gshl also lost their 1b demand 2013 till date indians hold ajaokuta to ransom one would have assumed the drama over in 2013 but alas the federal governments hands are tied on progressing with ascl gshl shrewdly crafted an arbitration clause in the contract between the government and gshl which prohibits nigeria from dealing with anybody until all matters with gshl are resolved in other words the indians do not want nigeerian government to proceed on completing ajaokuta until an unreasonably selfish condition is met they want the nigerian government to give itakpe iron ore company to them free for 25 years at the moment of this report there is a modified contract containing such ridiculous terms before the minister of solid minerals in favour of the indians gshl wants to tap iron ore from itakpe and move to delta steel which was in june 2015 taken over by premium steel a company set up just months before the purchase of delta steel premium steel is owned by another powerful indian conglomerate headed by the vasuwani brothers owners of the controversial stallion group truth is that itakpe was set up as a captive mine to ascl the original plan holds that iron ore would be moved from itakpe to ascl which will in turn distribute to other smaller rolling mills delta steel inclusive if gshl succeeds in its bid to take charge of itakpe ascl will become a sad history as there will be no ore to feed from that means kogi state will have no steel plant of its own ever again so no matter that amount of pacifying information the government publishes for the public on the urgency and good intention they have towards ascl nothing shall be done until the arbitration is terminated patriotic nigerians must call on the nigerian government to immediately terminate every agreement in whatever form with gshl nigeria is too big a nation to be held captive by an indian company tpe a whole russian government owned company who built the complex did not cause this much pain to nigeria why would a private indian company who has never operated any steel plant in its own country india do such a thing to us a more worrisome question to answer is who re the heavyweight nigerians behind gshl selling us this cheap i don t believe mr primod mittal would have the courage to stand alone and dare this much pandemonium so who are the greedy nigerians toiling with the present and future of kogi state and nigerians no matter what nigerians must remember that the masses are always majority and the power to determine our future truly lies in our hands our silence and ignorance has only cost us this much russian tyazhpromexport tpe is back with hope for nigeria the sole administrator of ascl egnr onobere has repeatedly said that since the russians left in 1994 no progress has been realized on the project the following questions kept hovering my mind the moment nigeria realized their mistake in not completing ascl and were ready to commence completion why were the russians not called back to resume works why did we settle for solgas and gshl in the first and second instances from the quality of work evident in ajaokuta is there any doubt on the expertise of tpe that questioned their invitation could it be that tpe wasn t invited because the russians are too straight forward and don t engage in smart business my research led me to uncover a lot of conspiracies on how tpe is no longer interested in doing business with nigeria and some even said tpe no longer exists my curiosity took the better part of me and i decided to look them up the internet and initiate contacts i sent an e mail to tpe in mid november and another early december 2015 none were replied it is said that desperate times require desperate measures and that when you truly want to do something you shall find a way so i contacted a dear friend of mine who lives in russia and who happens to be the acting chairman of russia s arbitration court on international economic matters mr tunde adewon as god would have it he is also a nigerian born to a father from ondo state and a russian mother his father late engr moses adewon was one of the senior engineers who worked to build the itakpe iron ore complex mr adewon on behalf of builders hub visited tpe in moscow russia in the 2nd week in december 2015 after the first brief meeting tpe as precautionary measures ran a security check on me then mr adewon was called for a detailed meeting and this was noted tpe expressed deep sadness at the manner in which ascl was handled tpe said their heart was poured into the project in other to give nigeria the greatest country in africa the biggest steel complex in africa that never in all of their works across the world not even in india did they build a steel city as big as ajaokuta complex that it was sad nigeria did not heed to their warnings about the international conspiracies and nigeria turned their back to them instead of seeing the bright future they dreamt for us that we by our own hands allowed our economy to be trampled amidst negative interests by other powerful countries that over the past years they had tried reaching out to the nigerian government to allow them come back and complete the project nigeria did not respond positively that they would want nothing more than to work to revive ajaokuta and help nigeria create jobs for its people and take itself out of poverty nigeria they said must wake up from its slumber and be greater than ever before for itself and for africa during a skype meeting tpe was advised to write a letter of intent to the minister of solid minerals i also made it clear that neither i nor mr adewon were interested in any monetary reward we were only good citizens of nigeria trying to use our best arsenals to contribute our quota in helping our country they appreciated our honesty on the 25th of december 2015 christmas day tpe wrote and sent the letter which i have attached to this post to the minister of solid minerals dr kayode fayemi tpe is expecting to be invited over to discuss a path forward which would first entail technical evaluation of ascl to ascertain damage and recommend modernization and upgrade plans for completion tpe said they are very ready to come to nigeria even at a week s notice on monday the 18th january i paid a courtesy visit to the minister himself dr fayemi acknowledged reading the letter from tpe and mentioned the ministry would look into it i pleaded with him on the need to expedite actions regarding ascl and reminded him of the tpe s intentions should be considered a priority 4 weeks after the letter was sent to the ministry and no response from the minister s office i visited the department of steel within the ministry to my shock no one had seen or heard of the letter of intent question what happened to the tpe s letter after the minister read it is it not supposed to be sent to the steel and legal departments for action do you also know that till today no committee has been set up to investigate into ascl
i needed an attention grabber for a title but this piece focuses on the implications of publicly available data and is not intended to be provocative it is a summary of how your tax dollars are being spent locally and what needs to be done to change it if we are going to start being fiscally responsible and have the best shot at maintaining or i dare say growing property values over time although the topic may seem boring bear with me because the numbers are enthralling unfortunately in a bad way currently first a caveat in anticipation of some nasty and or ignorant responses that will likely come my way for discussing the fiscal reality behind the veneer we have excellent schools a beautiful town and everyone i know including myself wants to keep it that way i have gone to hartford to give public testimony multiple times this year to fight against forced school regionalization as well as statewide car and property taxes that will exacerbate negative trends facing all residents second my experience with every town representative i have talked to is that they are well intended people they are representing us on a voluntary basis and have spent many hours in town meetings along with work outside of meetings ok with that out of the way onto some data and analysis some context that sets the framework new canaan has the highest debt per resident and second highest spending per resident out of 169 towns and cities in the state for comparative purposes our debt per resident is almost double that of darien and spending per resident is roughly 10 percent more according to the connecticut economic resource center a non partisan arm of the connecticut government focused on research and economic development one should think of our town debt as deferred spending all of it will be borne by taxpayers at some point the totality of our current and deferred spending far exceeds that of any the 169 towns and cities in connecticut according to a yankee institute comparative town analysis in a sixteen year period between 1996 2012 new canaan raised property tax rates by about 150 percent to support an approximately 160 percent increase in spending or about 10 percent on average a year excluding the effect of compounding would anyone reading this manage their household or business expenses this way excessive spending begets excessive leverage our town debt is about 75 percent higher than the average of our district reference group of neighboring towns our debt service costs our annual costs to pay back our debt is roughly 12 percent of our total budget one goal of the board of finance is to lower our debt service cost to under 10 percent in the next five years to do that our newly issued debt would have to be zero over this timeframe there is a greater likelihood of the sun rising in the west one of the primary reasons we need to issue new debt is to pay off maturing debt in addition there are non discretionary maintenance expenses that are typically bonded to keep our public stock from falling into disrepair we are caught in a pickle of our own creation and have little flexibility to change things without making some fiscally conservative decisions that brings us to boe spending which consumes roughly 60 percent of the town s budget here is some summary data from a roughly 20 year look back at boe spending i recently did in an 8 year period between 2001 2009 spending per pupil went up by close to 60 percent at that point our spending per pupil was about 16 900 our increases since 2009 have come off of a much larger base created by a period of extremely large increases in the previous decade our total elementary school enrollment has declined by over 10 percent in the last 17 years while our spending per student has more than double during this period birth rates have declined steadily from 210 in 2005 to 138 currently we are likely to see an increase in kindergarten enrollment this year but the longer term trends continue to be down and are the basis for the new england school development council an organization boes use for enrollment projections among other uses projecting an enrollment decline of about 15 percent over the next 10 years in our public schools from 2007 2017 our total school enrollment was up about 2 percent according to nesdec data while fte count was up about 16 percent according to ct department of education data other non instructional staff fte count was up about 40 percent we could have 81 less ftes probably save several million a year i am not saying we should and be at the fte student same ratio as darien who has better academic outcomes than us from 8th grade on when the cumulative impact of one s academic experience is more fully realized if one uses fy 2018 boe debt expense the proposed boe budget implies spending roughly 24 500 per student this is roughly 10 percent higher than the average current spending of our drg making conservative assumptions about their boe debt levels finally there is no correlation between per pupil spending and academic outcomes as measured by standardized test scores according to the state s office of legislative research about 80 percent of the variance between standardized test scores among students is attributable to parental educational attainment and whether or not the student is coming from a single family home a core group of generally excellent staff and administrators which we have and certainly pay for is important what is more important in determining academic outcomes is the family the students are coming from and their deep involvement in the students lives so what to do about all of the above to be clear on what i believe should happen we should hold our boe spending flat this year and our overall town budget flat at most for the next few years until we work off some excess home inventory and our local property tax rates start to become more predictably contained we have 18 months of home inventory the most in fairfield county that much supply will lead to lower prices and presumably higher tax rates down the road to offset them unless we start producing fiscally conservative budgets we should eliminate all non maintenance capital expenditures over this time period a flat town budget will entail some staff reductions at the boe something none of us want but my concern is that unless we take serious steps to address our fiscal situation now the staff reductions will become much greater in the future especially if we face a recession westport is cutting 17 ftes in the boe this year a decision i am sure they did not make lightly in terms of what readers can do my hope is that more people start getting involved in local government either through writing to our town representatives showing up at town meetings and or running for local office we have local elections in november ask every representative what their opinion is of the issues mentioned above and how they would change the status quo going forward the status quo this year is a property tax rate that will be up about 7 8 percent this year and property tax burden that will be up over 10 percent for around a quarter of our residents many of whom are seniors living on fixed incomes at one end of the spectrum some residents saw a 5 year revaluation on their homes up 30 percent plus meaning a tax burden increase of 37 38 percent even in the midst of an overall town revaluation down 7 2 percent this compares to 5 year town revaluations in darien and wilton down about 1 percent and 2 percent respectively why are we performing worse at the other end of the spectrum many have seen large double digit declines in their home assessment in the revaluation whether one is facing a much higher tax burden much lower home valuation or something in between no one is a winner with all of this said there are little steps of progress in our budget this year but it is not even close to enough in my view in the context of over spending for decades we have some representatives such as town councilman mike mauro and council chairman john engel for example that are consistent in advocating and pushing for a more fiscally conservative agenda but they and others face an uphill battle there are a number of other representatives on both sides of the aisle that are fine with inexorable increases in spending and property tax rates to fund that spending i am asking readers to be vocal do some digging on town fiscal matters and if you are concerned with what i wrote only vote for representatives that can clearly define a pathway to flat or lower local tax burdens and stabilizing real estate values please email me at jdb435 nyu edu with any questions or follow up you have if you want to be part of the change

listen to this article listen to this article hiring in the united states rebounded in march as u s employers added a solid 196 000 jobs up sharply from february s scant gain and evidence that many businesses still want to hire despite signs that the economy is slowing the unemployment rate remained at 3 8 near the lowest level in almost 50 years the labor department reported friday wage growth slowed a bit in march with average hourly pay increasing 3 2 from a year earlier that was down from february s year over year gain of 3 4 the best in a decade the employment figures reported friday by the government suggest that february s anemic job growth revised to 33 000 from an initial 20 000 was merely a temporary blip and that businesses are confident the economy remains on a firm footing even with the current expansion nearly 10 years old the u s economy remains resilient and is expected to grow at a steady pace this year the labor market continues to shrug off headwinds and chug along said martha gimbel director of economic research at job listings website indeed at the same time the economy is facing several challenges from cautious consumers to slower growth in business investment to a u s china trade war that is contributing to a weakening global economy investors didn t react much to the report the stock market rose modestly in morning trading with the dow jones industrial average up 45 points the solid hiring and modest wage figure probably aren t enough to change the federal reserve s current plans to hold off on additional interest rate hikes economists said fed officials as recently as december had suggested they could raise rates twice this year but in march after financial markets turned volatile and inflation showed signs of slipping the fed said it would likely keep rates unchanged this year the jobs data are not strong enough to dislodge the fed from its current policy path said joe brusuelas chief economist at rsm a consulting firm yet the data also provides little reason for the fed to cut rates economists said president donald trump however urged the fed to do just that and restore the bond buying program it used to lower longer term interest rates earlier this decade in the aftermath of the great recession an approach known as quantitative easing our country s doing unbelievably well economically trump said but he also said fed policy makers really slowed us down and if they dropped rates and resumed buying bonds you would see a rocket ship quantitative easing was an emergency tool that the fed under chairman ben bernanke used to purchase trillions of dollars of government bonds and other securities the third and last round was launched in 2012 when the unemployment rate was still 8 percent trump has announced he intends to nominate two conservative political allies stephen moore and former 2012 gop presidential candidate herman cain for two current vacancies on the seven member fed board his latest selections are seen as a significant escalation in efforts to exert more political influence on the traditionally independent central bank larry kudlow head of the president s national economic council has said that the administration respects the independence of the fed but that should not stop trump from voicing his views on the fed s actions kudlow was the first administration official to call for the fed to cut interest rates saying last week that he believed a cut of one half percentage point would be appropriate as an insurance policy against the economy slowing so far this year u s job gains have averaged 180 000 a month easily enough to lower the unemployment rate over time though down from a 223 000 monthly average last year last month job growth was strongest in the service sector health care added 49 000 jobs restaurants and bars 27 000 and professional and business services which includes such high paying fields as engineering and accounting 37 000 manufacturers cut 6 000 jobs marking the first decline in a year and a half the weakness stemmed from a sharp drop in employment at automakers likely reflecting layoffs by general motors construction firms added 16 000 the overall economy is sending mixed signals most indicators suggest slower growth this year compared with 2018 that would mean hiring might also weaken from last year s strong pace consumers have shown caution so far this year retail sales fell in february and a broader measure of consumer spending slipped in january potentially reflecting a waning effect of the trump administration s tax cuts businesses have also reined in their spending on industrial machinery and other equipment and on factories and other buildings and in europe and asia weaker economies have reduced demand for u s exports europe is on the brink of recession with its factories shrinking in march at the fastest pace in six years according to a private survey the u s trade war with china has weighed on the chinese economy which has hurt southeast asian nations that ship electronic components and other goods that are assembled into consumer products in china s factories economists now forecast that the u s economy will expand roughly 2 to 2 5 this year down from 2 9 last year some positive signs for the economy have emerged in recent weeks sales of both new and existing homes rose in february after declining last year more americans are applying for mortgages now that rates have fallen and some of the weakness in spending earlier this year likely reflected delays in issuing tax refunds because of the government shutdown refunds largely caught up with their pace in previous years in march economists at bank of america merrill lynch said suggesting that spending may as well

washington dc merza hasan the executive director of the world bank wb group said that the real challenge before the egyptian economy at the present time is overpopulation noting that egypt s population grows by 2 3 annually which could destroy any economic progress when the population is large this makes it hard for the economy to achieve the desired growth hasan said adding that it is important to benefit from the chinese model in this area he explained that by 2050 the arab world must generate 300m jobs according to a wb study which seems unachievable in many arab countries and with the current job automation this task will be much harder the world is busy right now with exploring the possible impact of technology on the business sector and job creation especially in view of the latest report of the organization for economic co operation and development oecd which said that about two thirds of current jobs will not exist by 2030 indicated hasan another challenge economic growth in the arab region is facing is education schools in egypt do not teach anything and 70 of those in higher education institutions are in the arab world and we do not need their skills he said within that framework hasan said in a press statement during the door knock mission in washington that egypt has a good reform plan for education the arab world does not only need education but rather a revolution in the field as there is no consensus between education and jobs and as education years increase getting a job becomes harder he said despite these challenges hasan believes egypt has achieved good economic growth rates more than its surrounding countries the economy has started recovering and both the middle and low class and will soon begin to reap the fruits of reform the egyptian economy has deteriorated but then started recovering through the bold reforms that egyptians are paying for until now with this recovery egyptians will reap the benefits the middle class is the one paying the price for these economic reforms so they should get more state attention hasan revealed that cooperation programmes between the bank and egypt is one of the largest programmes in the world and that the total loans obtained by egypt from the bank since 1950 reached 18 4bn noting that the period from 2010 to 2020 saw loans of 8bn he noted that 64 of the investments of the wb in egypt used to be in cairo mainly in the financial sector whereas currently more than half of the investments are directed outside cairo especially in upper egypt hasan explained that world debt rose by 11 from 2017 to 2018 which shows that there is a supply of funds and an ease in resorting to borrowing this also shows that some governments have started facing difficulties in reforms to compensate for this through loans he said that egypt s initiative to control debt is a pioneering one in the region and in many countries of the world even though the egyptian debt is not concerning the proof is that egypt obtains the price of yields less than 2 of similar countries hasan also revealed that there are no egyptian requests for loans from wb at the time furthermore hasan added that there are no programmes between egypt and the bank regarding refugees and that the bank has only two programmes in the field in the region with lebanon and jordan with total spending beyond 1bn

co written by christian addai poku michael galant in february 2018 west virginia teachers launched a strike that reawakened a movement tens of thousands of teachers from around the country have taken part in what is now the largest strike wave in decades demanding better public education in the face of years of austerity on february 11 2019 as the u s wave continued teachers union leaders from across africa gathered in addis ababa for a meeting of african union heads of state with their own demands to halt the continent s moves toward privatized education and provide inclusive and equitable quality free public education for all though an ocean apart west virginia and addis ababa are two fronts in the same war the fight for public education reminds us that working class struggles around the world are linked and that international solidarity is the key to victory in many u s districts school funding still hasn t recovered from cuts made during the great recession teachers are underpaid classrooms are overcrowded and textbooks are out of date rather than increase funding conservative public figures like betsy devos trump s secretary of education have turned to private and charter schools that deepen inequality and further drain resources from the public system at the same time foreign owned for profit schools like bridge international academies and gems education have swept africa there is no doubt that the status quo of public education in much of the region is dire education systems are largely underfunded illiteracy remains high and a large gender gaps prevail but an unaccountable profit driven system funded largely by american and european investors is not the solution private schools crowd out the public sector base education on ability to pay and exacerbate economic and social stratification investors like bridge s digital taylorist curricula which are identical across all schools planned down to the minute and require specialized tablets that track the finger movements of their teachers however there s little evidence that such lessons adequately serve poor and working class students school privatization in africa is part of the same neoliberal project that inspired teachers to walk out in west virginia milton friedman free market ideologue advisor to both ronald reagan and margaret thatcher and mentor of the chicago boys is considered the founding father of the school choice movement in the united states it was his brand of market fundamentalism that was then foisted on the global south in the 1980s leading to africa s lost decade of growth and the continent s current state of education international monetary fund austerity demands inevitably forced public funding cuts while the world bank pushed school fees and privatization the world bank along with international aid agencies like the united kingdom s department for international development continue to promote for profit models even today in some cases privatization efforts in the united states and africa are led by the very same billionaires and corporations philanthrocapitalist bill gates has given roughly 10 million to a fund attempting to push oakland to the new orleans model full privatization it is no coincidence that gates is also one of the top funders behind bridge pearson the controversial education giant of common core fame holds stakes in both bridge and the comparable omega schools in ghana these are more than theoretical ties these are proof that we are in the same fight in 2016 ugandan courts ruled that bridge was not adequately licensed to operate and ordered the closure of its 63 schools in the country shortly thereafter 10 bridge schools were shuttered in kenya thanks in part to sustained pressure from the kenya national union of teachers ghanaian teachers are now pushing for the same since the beginning of the strike wave in the united states teachers have won vastly improved contracts including pay raises and increased school spending in west virginia oklahoma arizona colorado los angeles and oakland each of these victories is a blow against the global education privatization movement each is a material loss for funders like gates and pearson and a political loss for devos and her sympathizers at the world bank each builds the power of global union federations like education international and each fuels mobilization for further victories a court ruling against bridge international in kenya is a win against school choice in the united states a teachers strike in west virginia is a success for public education in africa the u s labor movement must not retreat into economic nationalism winning material gains for american workers while abandoning those beyond its borders the workers of the world are a part of the same fight to win the war a revitalized left must transcend borders building global solidarity not out of altruism but from an understanding that the struggle of the working class is global christian addai poku is president of education international ei africa region and former president of the national association of graduate teachers nagrat of ghana michael galant is a recent graduate of the master of public policy program at the harvard kennedy school of government he is interested in building global solidarity for left alternatives of globalization and

in that sense there is nothing new in president trump s aggressive approach to the fed this week he called for lower interest rates and new quantitative easing and he signaled an intention to appoint two vocal supporters stephen moore and herman cain to the board of governors they have pushed for lower interest rates and easier money or for this or that policy on bank regulation or consumer protection they have summoned fed leaders to the white house or congress to persuade and cajole politicians have had strong opinions on what the federal reserve should and shouldn t do throughout its 105 year history advertisement what makes trump s approach to the fed so unusual is that he has repeatedly publicly undermined a fed chief he appointed jerome powell and if successful he would put two officials with a background in partisan politics in the inner sanctum of fed policymaking moore was founder of the club for growth which supports conservative candidates for office and cain ran for president get breaking news alerts stay up to date with important news developments delivered right to your inbox enter email sign up it s more overtly political than anything we ve seen since at least the 80s and historically when we ve had political appointments and interventions in the fed there have been unintended consequences that last said julia coronado president of macropolicy perspectives and a former fed staffer it may be expedient in the near term but what s good for the next year or two may not be good for the next decade all presidential appointees to the fed s board of governors come with their own political point of view which generally dovetails with the president who appointed them but typically they have also brought deep technical expertise and an inclination to keep political dimensions out of fed debates people around the table did have political views and i did too said alan blinder who was appointed vice chairman of the fed by president bill clinton and is more recently the author of advice and dissent about the role of politicians versus technocrats in shaping policy but you weren t supposed to bring them into the room when it was time to make a decision and people didn t advertisement that is the tradition that trump s approach endangers you can read thousands of pages of transcripts of closed door fed policy meetings without seeing a reference to the political jockeying that occupies the rest of washington three times in recent decades a president has reappointed a fed chairman first named by a president of the opposite party ronald reagan with paul volcker clinton with alan greenspan and barack obama with ben bernanke you will see no political bumper stickers in the underground parking garage when dan tarullo an obama campaign veteran and a banking expert was named a governor in 2009 there was some tut tutting among staff that he initially left his sticker on in effect the risk is that the fed becomes yet another partisan battlefield as is often the case with the supreme court nomination process congressional intelligence oversight committees and regulators like the federal communications commission in the immediate future this probably wouldn t mean much for policy if nominated and confirmed moore and cain would hold two of 12 votes on the federal open market committee their ability to sway the fed toward trump s desired interest rate cuts and a new round of quantitative easing would depend on their ability to persuade their new colleagues advertisement it will be their task to convince the others that their way of thinking about monetary policy will improve the fed s ability to meet its legislative mandates for maximum employment and stable prices said don kohn a former fed vice chairman who was appointed by george w bush that will require solid economic analysis backed up by research the risk of more overt political divisions within the fed would come over time if the fed came to be seen as basing decisions on the political impulses of appointees rather than on sound economic analysis the united states role as the global reserve currency which results in persistently low interest rates and little fear of capital flight is built in significant part on the credibility the fed has accumulated over decades during the global financial crisis and its aftermath for example the fed could feel comfortable pursuing efforts to stimulate the us economy without a loss of faith in the dollar and treasury bonds by global investors the dollar actually rose against other currencies even as the economy was in free fall in late 2008 and the fed deployed trillions of dollars in unconventional programs to try to stop the crisis the hazards of a more politicized fed are evident from the experience of the early 1970s when richard nixon used both political pressure and underhanded tactics to try to push the fed chairman arthur burns to keep interest rates low heading into the 1972 election advertisement among other things the white house leaked a false story that burns sought a large pay raise at a time the fed was pressuring employers not to increase wages to fight inflation burns and the fed followed the president s wishes and nixon won reelection handily in 1972 amid a booming economy but it was in those years that inflationary pressures were building in the economy and within a few years the rate of inflation reached double digits no one would argue that the fed is divorced from politics it is constantly making decisions that pit the interests of workers against owners of capital and those of banks against those of consumers but there is a difference between acknowledging that there are choices that must be informed by political values and putting those political values ahead of what are often highly technical discussions in senate confirmation hearings would moore and cain adopt the cautious careful language typical of central bankers or embrace a role as partisan warriors the safest bet is that investors around the world will be watching carefully for hints of just how politicized the fed of the future will turn out to be
margaret talev craig torres and liz capo mccormick bloomberg news president donald trump called on the federal reserve to open the monetary floodgates to turn the world s largest economy into a rocket ship i personally think the fed should drop rates i think they really slowed us down there s no inflation i would say in terms of quantitative tightening it should actually now be quantitative easing he told reporters as he departed the white house on friday you would see a rocket ship despite that we re doing very well the request for fed assistance to boost growth came just after a labor department report showed another healthy sign for the durability of an expansion that may become the longest on record by midyear the jobless rate held near a 49 year low and employers added more workers than economists forecast in march the report showed little sign of wage inflation trump is breaking with longstanding republican criticism of the fed s large balance sheet and embracing a loose monetary policy that in effect helps finance the nation s debt load he repeatedly criticized the fed under president barack obama for holding down interest rates and the use of quantitative easing which at the time was an effort to lower long term borrowing costs by buying treasury bonds and mortgage securities stocks gained after trump s remarks the s p 500 index just posted its biggest quarterly advance in almost a decade a segment of the treasuries yield curve the difference between 3 month and 10 year rates narrowed friday though traders say that move began after the march jobs data was released the gap was at around 7 5 basis points from 8 7 basis points thursday the spread inverted last month for the first time since 2007 we don t even know what to make of trump s comment said ian lyngen head of u s rates strategy at bmo capital markets in new york trump has regularly called for rate cuts but his advice on the balance sheet went further into a debate that s mostly been among economists and investment professionals in the aftermath of the financial crisis a decade ago the fed bought government bonds and mortgage backed securities in a strategy called quantitative easing aimed at lowering longer term market rates after cutting its main policy rate close to zero that swelled the fed balance sheet to a peak of 4 52 trillion in early 2015 as the economy strengthened in recent years the central bank has allowed the securities to mature without reinvesting proceeds which some call quantitative tightening the balance sheet tally recently was 3 94 trillion central bankers in march held the benchmark lending rate in a range of 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent and said they would start slowing balance sheet shrinkage in may and halt the draw down altogether at the end of the september their forecasts showed they plan to hold their policy rate unchanged this year in another effort to influence fed policy trump plans to nominate two political loyalists for the fed s board of governors former godfather s pizza inc ceo herman cain and stephen moore a fellow at the conservative heritage foundation their qualifications for the board have been questioned by economists and many lawmakers and neither has been formally nominated trump s top economic adviser larry kudlow said the appointments aren t intended to undermine the fed s traditional political independence we are not going after their independence kudlow said in a bloomberg television interview friday we have our point of view fed rate increases last year drew criticism from the president who even discussed firing chairman jerome powell kudlow observed that inflation is low even as wages rise why raise interest rates

russia could be the bearer of good news for the american president one of the fundamental rules of global politics in the last century was that total war should end in total victory the winning side could not be satisfied with any other result it is this world view that led to two world wars and then to the cold war for a significant part of the 20th century opponents in domestic politics ruled according to the winner takes all principle and rarely showed tolerance toward one another fortunately in the modern world the total victory rule has lost its relevance the conflict of the u s democratic party and the country s pro democratic political economic elite who oppose republican donald trump the candidate who unexpectedly won the 2016 presidential election is of course conducted for the sake of achieving victory drawing attention to itself and gaining an electoral advantage in the 2020 presidential election but the aim of this confrontation is not to destroy the opponent or destroy the foundations of the u s political system or undermine the legitimacy of its ruling elite the main task for the democrats is to make adjustments to the current system of power relations to increase options and establish a convenient starting position in the new election campaign it has essentially already begun the conclusions of special counsel robert mueller s report regarding the results of the two year investigation into possible russian interference in the american 2016 presidential election campaign represent a victory for trump but clearly not a total victory the democrats who are attempting to attribute their defeat in the election to unexpected and treacherous russian interference in the u s internal political process expended all their steam on blowing the whistle the accusations made by barack obama in the autumn of 2016 which were then taken up by all key figures of the democratic party have turned out to be unfounded the democrats and the pro democratic press have been exposed as liars who deliberately employ fake news trump s victory which he as is his tradition announced on twitter will not be a total one there are a number of reasons for this first mueller s report will not reduce the intensity of the political struggle in the u s the democrats will no longer be able to attribute their defeat to russian interference however their frustration at the 2016 loss will not subside the pro democrat business elite which has ridden the process of globalization without thinking about its full effects cannot find a common language with trump voters and we are talking about the tens of millions of supporters from the rust belt of the u s i e the old industrial regions suffering from deindustrialization a significant proportion of the american middle class which has gained practically nothing from globalization is also entering the circle of trump supporters recent new york times articles show that for the times which is one of the main instruments of the democrats information war against trump the special counsel s conclusions mean nothing russian interference in the elections is being replaced by other themes that will be used to pressure the president the negative relationship with nato refusal to criticize vladimir putin softness in the approach to applying economic pressure against russia intolerance toward immigrants corruption in the white house etc second this victory has clearly arrived too late for trump if the results of the investigation which are favorable for trump had been discovered at the beginning of his presidential term let s say in the second half of 2017 then russian american relations would have developed along a different more positive trajectory the publication of a similar report in the second half of 2020 on the eve of the next u s presidential election would allow trump to transform a political victory into an electoral advantage over the democrats however the publication of the report at this moment in time in the middle of his presidential term can give the republicans only a sense of moral satisfaction the political consequences of this move will be minimal and this victory will soon be forgotten third the current victory of course allows us to destroy the myth one heavily supported by the democratic party and large pro democratic business that trump is not here to stay and that his presidency is an illogical zigzag in america s political history nevertheless the destruction of the myth about trump s collusion with russia will lead his congressional opponents to deploy a campaign against him in some other sphere democrats need to come up with something more enlightening something substantiated by facts in their criticism of trump and he in response needs to develop a new argument in the confrontation with his opponents the old war front will be replaced with a new one this is good news for russia but not so much for trump russia could become one of the few beneficiaries of the mueller report there is a window of opportunity in russian american relations for a way out of the current crisis and a return to constructive dialogue now nothing is stopping trump from announcing his readiness to start preparing for the long overdue summit with putin but trump s opponents of whom there are many in his administration especially in the state department and the pentagon need to organize some new kind of provocation and to repeating the example set by the november 2018 ukrainian provocation in the kerch strait which turned out to be quite effective back then this led to a break at the summit in argentina hard times are coming for trump the upturn of the u s financial market which lasted for six months came to a halt in the fall of 2018 the rapid growth of the american economy has stopped as the effects of tax incentives and the increase in budget spending have dried up due to the increase in domestic debt the multiple trade wars that washington is carrying out with both its allies and its opponents with equal amounts of passion are cooling the economic growth further still economic stagnation and a rise in unemployment are on the horizon therefore trump urgently needs good news from the sphere of international politics in the last few months russia has repeatedly said that we do not have entrenched differences with washington we are ready to work constructively against the background of the failure of american peacekeeping on the korean peninsula and the spiral of confrontation with china it is russia that may

washington ap hiring in the united states rebounded in march as u s employers added a solid 196 000 jobs up sharply from february s scant gain and evidence that many businesses still want to hire despite signs that the economy is slowing the unemployment rate remained at 3 8 near the lowest level in almost 50 years the labor department reported friday wage growth slowed a bit in march with average hourly pay increasing 3 2 from a year earlier that was down from february s year over year gain of 3 4 the best in a decade the employment figures reported friday by the government suggest that february s anemic job growth revised to 33 000 from an initial 20 000 was merely a temporary blip and that businesses are confident the economy remains on a firm footing even with the current expansion nearly 10 years old the u s economy remains resilient and is expected to grow at a steady pace this year the labor market continues to shrug off headwinds and chug along said martha gimbel director of economic research at job listings website indeed at the same time the economy is facing several challenges from cautious consumers to slower growth in business investment to a u s china trade war that is contributing to a weakening global economy investors didn t react much to the report the stock market rose modestly in morning trading with the dow jones industrial average up 45 points the solid hiring and modest wage figure probably aren t enough to change the federal reserve s current plans to hold off on additional interest rate hikes economists said fed officials as recently as december had suggested they could raise rates twice this year but in march after financial markets turned volatile and inflation showed signs of slipping the fed said it would likely keep rates unchanged this year the jobs data are not strong enough to dislodge the fed from its current policy path said joe brusuelas chief economist at rsm a consulting firm yet the data also provides little reason for the fed to cut rates economists said president donald trump however urged the fed to do just that and restore the bond buying program it used to lower longer term interest rates earlier this decade in the aftermath of the great recession an approach known as quantitative easing our country s doing unbelievably well economically trump said but he also said fed policy makers really slowed us down and if they dropped rates and resumed buying bonds you would see a rocket ship quantitative easing was an emergency tool that the fed under chairman ben bernanke used to purchase trillions of dollars of government bonds and other securities the third and last round was launched in 2012 when the unemployment rate was still 8 percent trump has announced he intends to nominate two conservative political allies stephen moore and former 2012 gop presidential candidate herman cain for two current vacancies on the seven member fed board his latest selections are seen as a significant escalation in efforts to exert more political influence on the traditionally independent central bank larry kudlow head of the president s national economic council has said that the administration respects the independence of the fed but that should not stop trump from voicing his views on the fed s actions kudlow was the first administration official to call for the fed to cut interest rates saying last week that he believed a cut of one half percentage point would be appropriate as an insurance policy against the economy slowing so far this year u s job gains have averaged 180 000 a month easily enough to lower the unemployment rate over time though down from a 223 000 monthly average last year last month job growth was strongest in the service sector health care added 49 000 jobs restaurants and bars 27 000 and professional and business services which includes such high paying fields as engineering and accounting 37 000 manufacturers cut 6 000 jobs marking the first decline in a year and a half the weakness stemmed from a sharp drop in employment at automakers likely reflecting layoffs by general motors construction firms added 16 000 the overall economy is sending mixed signals most indicators suggest slower growth this year compared with 2018 that would mean hiring might also weaken from last year s strong pace consumers have shown caution so far this year retail sales fell in february and a broader measure of consumer spending slipped in january potentially reflecting a waning effect of the trump administration s tax cuts businesses have also reined in their spending on industrial machinery and other equipment and on factories and other buildings and in europe and asia weaker economies have reduced demand for u s exports europe is on the brink of recession with its factories shrinking in march at the fastest pace in six years according to a private survey the u s trade war with china has weighed on the chinese economy which has hurt southeast asian nations that ship electronic components and other goods that are assembled into consumer products in china s factories economists now forecast that the u s economy will expand roughly 2 to 2 5 this year down from 2 9 last year some positive signs for the economy have emerged in recent weeks sales of both new and existing homes rose in february after declining last year more americans are applying for mortgages now that rates have fallen and some of the weakness in spending earlier this year likely reflected delays in issuing tax refunds because of the government shutdown refunds largely caught up with their pace in previous years in march economists at bank of america merrill lynch said suggesting that spending may as well
court records from stephen moore s divorce paint president donald trump s nominee for the federal reserve board as a brazen philanderer who openly talked about his mistress in front of his kids and then continued shorting his ex wife on tens of thousands of dollars in alimony and child support even after a judge held him in contempt of court i have two women and what s really bad is when they fight over you moore said to the couple s children in front of his former wife allison at their son s graduation ceremony court records claim other court records show moore who is a distinguished visiting fellow at the conservative heritage foundation has a 75 000 irs tax lien against him for unpaid taxes on his 2014 filing the lien relates to a deduction he took for both alimony and child support to his ex wife he has said he is contesting that amount despite that and the revelations from the moores divorce trump continues to back moore s nomination to the fed according to a senior white house official who spoke to cnbc potus is completely behind him that official said in an email using the acronym for president of the united states the conduct by moore a conservative economist as alleged by his former wife stands in sharp contrast to his publicly published positions on marriage what is irrefutable is that marriage with a devoted husband and wife in the home is a far better social program than food stamps medicaid public housing or even all of them combined moore wrote in a 2014 washington times article in which he contended the nation s economic success would depend on a culture of virtue strong families and parents and a resurgence of the protestant work ethic name a government program that can take the place of a father but more than three years before that moore was not acting like a devoted husband allison moore said in a divorce action filed in august 2010 after two decades of marriage and then when the couple split she claimed he did not pay her or their three children what he had agreed to she said it was only after a judge s contempt order and a threat in that order to have moore arrested so he could purge that contempt that he began paying alimony and child support allison and stephen moore on monday both issued statements using friendly language about each other with allison saying they had reconciled through our divorce a nomination already under fire trump on march 22 said he would nominate moore to the fed s board of governors after he read a wall street journal column moore had co authored entitled the fed is a threat to growth the column slammed the hike in interest rates by the central bank in the latter half of 2018 which moore claimed was preventing the economy from maximizing the growth it should be realizing from trump s financial policies moore who was an adviser to trump s 2016 president campaign and co wrote the 2018 book trumponomics inside the america first plan to revive our economy in december had called for fed chairman jerome powell to resign after the central bank increased interest rates moore s position on interest rates dovetails with that of trump s annoyance with powell and the fed while trump has called moore a very respected economist not everyone in the economics field is nearly so impressed with him greg mankiw a conservative who headed the council of economic advisers under president george w bush said in a blog post that moore lacked the intellectual gravitas for the fed post an npr article about the nomination quoted the university of michigan s justin wolfers saying of moore more than possibly any other economist in modern america he has a track record of getting the big issues wrong not just occasionally but time after time after the financial crisis in 2008 moore had predicted incorrectly that low interest rates set by the fed to encourage a recovery would lead to high inflation he also assisted with the plan to slash income taxes in kansas under gov sam brownback which resulted in the state s bond rating being cut and revenue falling hundreds of millions of dollars the center on budget and policy priorities noted in may 2017 that was the same year the gop controlled state legislature overrode brownback s veto and undid his tax cuts when trump formally submits moore s nomination to the senate the senate banking committee will be responsible for reviewing moore s nomination and for forwarding it for a vote to the full senate the majority republican committee has yet to schedule a hearing for moore the spokeswoman for the committee s majority noted that moore has yet to be formally nominated she also noted that committee chairman sen mike crapo r idaho has said it s a priority to fill every seat on the board and that it will receive prompt attention the spokeswoman had no comment on the details of moore s divorce and financial dispute with his ex wife the ranking democrat on the banking committee sen sherrod brown ofohio said last week when asked about moore i don t see him as a qualified person to be on the fed the details surrounding moore s divorce contained in fairfax county virginia court files may make his path to confirmation even trickier the guardian newspaper first reported saturday about details of the moores divorce and the fact that a judge in fairfax county had held stephen moore in contempt of court for failing to pay allison more than 300 000 in alimony child support and the balance of their divorce settlement moore was first found in contempt of a court order by a judge in november 2012 in march 2013 a judge issued another order demanding he purge himself of his contempt by paying allison what he had agreed to under their settlement months later he avoided a court ordered sale of his house by paying allison 217 000 toward his arrearage of more than 333 300 a bitter end and then a reconciliation on monday the guardian posted online the case records it used for its original report hours after cnbc broke the news that the file had been sealed to public inspection at allison s request in december 2009 allison claimed stephen moore created two accounts on the dating web site match com the sole purpose of which was to connect romantically with other women after meeting and dating at least one other woman through those accounts stephen moore by his own admission commenced a romantic adulterous relationship with sherri wallmark by february 2010 court records state moore was neither discreet nor inconspicuous with his relationship with ms wallmark allison claimed in her divorce action in fact he tastelessly and openly spoke with on several occasions about plans and events he was attending with ms wallmark allison also claimed stephen left documents around their house related to his relationship with wallmark including bills showing extravagant dinners charges for gasoline purchased near wallmark s home and an airline ticket bought by stephen with wallmark listed as a passenger allison s complaint said she saw a t shirt that stephen had bought for wallmark with the nike logo and the words doing it wallmark in an interview with cnbc denied knowing moore when he was married although she did not deny having been in a relationship with him in the past that s not true wallmark said when told that allison had accused stephen moore of committing adultery with wallmark his ex wife is literally nuts allison moore s lawyer david roop declined to comment on wallmark s remarks she said in court records that she had been a good and dutiful wife to stephen but that she has suffered emotional and psychological abuse from him throughout their marriage allison moore said in her filing that in the fall of 2009 she had no other option but to leave the marital home with the youngest of their three children then aged 8 to protect herself from defendant and his influence on their two older kids her intent she said was to give stephen space to allow him to get help and change his behavior at the time she wrote she hoped she would be able to reconcile with him since then has neither altered his behavior towards nor ended his adulterous affair the complaint said allison s complaint called her the primary caretaker and role model for their children stephen on the other hand has recently acted indifferent towards their children and was providing little or no supervision to their two older sons who were living with him in the marital residence the complaint said in a may 2011 filing by stephen he wrote that he admits all the allegations in allison s complaint since the divorce however the two have reached an understanding allison moore and i were married for 19 years and have three wonderful sons whom we have co parented stephen moore said in a statement provided to cnbc our divorce was settled amicably many years ago and we remain on friendly terms to this day she is a terrific mother and i hold her in the highest regard he added allison our kids and my current wife would hope that the media would please respect our privacy i am happy to speak to the media on any matters related to the economy or my views on the fed allison moore in a statement released by stephen s spokeswoman said steve moore and i reconciled through our divorce many years ago and we would hope the media would respect our privacy we remain on cordial terms
washington ap a month ago many economists fretted that the 10 year u s expansion looked wobbly but after the government reported friday that hiring rebounded in march the economy suddenly looks sturdy again growth has weakened since last year to something closer to the modest pace that has prevailed for most of the nearly decade long expansion the jolt from the trump administration s 2017 tax cuts and greater government spending last year has faded and the global economy has swiveled from a driver of the u s economy to a headwind yet last month s solid job gain of 196 000 may also help undercut any lingering fears that a recession might arrive over the next year or so the economy s slow but steady pace of growth is likely to keep inflation low and perhaps sustain the expansion which is set to become the longest on record in july advertisement by historical measures the expansion has fallen short of the sometimes explosive growth that businesses and workers enjoyed in the past but that often led to financial bubbles or economic excesses and eventually a recession your subscription could not be saved please try again your subscription has been successful subscribe to our daily newsletter sign me up lackluster means that you re not overheating josh wright chief economist at recruiting software maker icims said of the current expansion it s more stable and we ll have fewer imbalances it looks like we ll be able to prolong this recovery even further in its monthly jobs report friday the government also said the unemployment rate remained near a five decade low of 3 8 in march so far this year job growth has averaged a decent 180 000 a month that is down though from last year s 223 000 monthly average and it marks the lowest three month average gain since november 2017 before the tax cuts took effect wage growth also slipped a bit in march with average hourly pay increasing 3 2 from a year earlier that is down from february s year over year gain of 3 4 the best in a decade today s data paint a picture of resilient u s demand that has stepped down to a more moderate pace of growth following last year s robust gains said jonathan millar senior economist at barclays investors took friday s jobs data in stride the stock market was up slightly in afternoon trading extending a rally that has lifted the financial markets this year advertisement given that that hiring and wage growth aren t growing so fast as to threaten high inflation the federal reserve is likely to stay on the sidelines indefinitely forgoing interest rate hikes economists said as recently as december fed officials had forecast that they would raise rates twice this year but in march after financial markets turned volatile inflation showed signs of slipping and concerns grew about the global economy the fed said it would likely keep rates unchanged in 2019 yet the jobs data also provides little reason for the fed to cut rates analysts said despite president donald trump s repeated calls for the fed to do just that on friday trump went further urging the fed to renew the bond buying program it had used to lower longer term borrowing rates earlier this decade after the

resumed buying bonds you would see a rocket ship quantitative easing was an emergency tool that the fed under chairman ben bernanke used to buy trillions in government bonds and other securities the third and last round was launched in 2012 when the unemployment rate was still 8 the fed s policies probably contributed to another shortcoming of the current expansion it has benefited wealthier americans more than others that s because the fed s qe program by holding down rates on treasury securities led many investors to put more money into stocks raising their values the stock market has tripled since bottoming a decade ago benefiting the richest one tenth of americans who own about 80 of the value of u s shares home equity a much more vital source of wealth for the middle class has recovered much less and many households remain gripped by financial insecurity despite the steady pace of hiring forty percent of workers earn less than 16 an hour according to government data analyzed by the economic policy institute in march hiring did pick up in higher paying sectors such as professional and business services which added 37 000 jobs in engineering it services accounting and other fields manufacturers did not fare as well cutting 6 000 jobs the sector s first decline in a year and a half mostly because of layoffs by general motors construction firms added 16 000 jobs

partner has found it much harder to find a new bookkeeper than he did the last time he filled the position in late 2016 back then advertising mostly by word of mouth turned up unsolicited requests for interviews and candidates with advanced degrees now dunlap has interviewed only three potential hires this year despite raising the job s starting pay about 2 an hour to roughly 15 that s the big challenge these days just finding staff dunlap said like hiring growth is also expected to decelerate this year to about a 2 25 pace down from 2 9 in 2018 the fastest expansion in three years in the

in this march 7 2019 file photo visitors to the pittsburgh veterans job fair meet with recruiters at heinz field in pittsburgh ap photo keith srakocic file the u s job market returned to normal in march with robust hiring and wage growth across many industries easing fears about the economy s health after hiring cratered in february the economy added 196 000 jobs last month the labor department reported friday in line with expectations and a rebound from what now seems an anomalous 33 000 jobs added in february the unemployment rate stayed at 3 8 percent and economists cited strong hiring to predict the united states faces almost no risk of an imminent recession the labor market remains healthy and last month is just an outlier said brad mcmillan chief investment officer at commonwealth financial network february s job slowdown may have been driven by a pair of temporary factors employers hesitation to bring on new employees in the deep of winter and an economic hangover from the lengthy government shutdown that shook the confidence of business owners and investors most economists predict the economy will slow this year to a good but not great pace as the effects of the tax cuts and additional government spending fade they expect the pace of hiring to moderate as companies see less need to expand job gains were strong in health care restaurants and professional services such as computer services but blue collar hiring decelerated in recent weeks with manufacturing shedding 6 000 jobs partly driven by the closure of a large general motors auto factory in ohio the pace of construction jobs also slowed after months of robust gains experts are watching to see if this is a temporary easing or the beginning of a deeper slowdown in certain parts of the economy the level of temporary workers while still high has stalled this year another sign the economy might be cooling as widely expected noted said erica groshen a visiting scholar at cornell university and former head of the bureau of labor statistics the nonpartisan agency that tabulates the jobs data the labor market is very strong the only slightly yellow warning sign is temporary help she said it s a leading indicator that can be a harbinger that companies are slowing down hiring or take a pause businesses typically hire temporary workers when they want to expand their workforce quickly but those workers are also often the first to go when firms try to cut costs president donald trump said we re doing very well friday before boarding a plane to head to the u s mexico border he blamed any economic weakness on the federal reserve arguing the economy would be performing like a rocketship if the central bank would drop rates trump is in the process of nominating two close allies of his

site for companies looking for temporary workers everyone is having trouble hiring raising wages is one way to fix it roston said target announced this week it will raise its starting pay to 13 an hour in june a full dollar increase over the company s current minimum wage and another sign of how competition has escalated for workers this is the third pay raise target has done in the past two
