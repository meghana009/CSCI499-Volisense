by amy s the devaluation of the dollar has been happening for the last 70 years or so especially after 1971 the devaluation of the dollar is a monetary phenomenon and typically driven by lowering interest rates by the federal reserve to increase credit and liquidity from the moment of the launch of quantitative easing qe worried investors have asked will the u s dollar collapse there are some probable scenarios that might cause a precipitous crisis for the dollar the most authentic is the dual threat of high inflation and high debt a scenario in which increasing consumer prices force the fed to raise interest rates sharply much of the national debt is made up of relatively short term instruments so a spike in rates would act like an adjustable rate mortgage after the teaser period ends if the u s government struggled to afford its interest payments foreign creditors could dump the dollar and trigger an economic collapse a reset means the banksters will have to increase the price of the gold they own tons of it so that they can cover their derivative positions the global currency reset is needed to hinder the most significant and fastest increase in global debt in half a century from exploding but for the average middle class family or pensioner on social security it will mean huge inflation as the reset will imply an exponential increase in the quantity of money by the fed meaning high inflation in the prices of everything excluding for maybe some food items that are subsidized by the government to impede people with pensions linked to the chained cpi from literally starving when you weaponize a reserve currency for personal gain such as what wall street and the fed have done on behalf of corporate interests that provide little to no benefit to even your own population your days are numbered the only thing that could ever collapse the dollar would be a sound medium of value aka gold third world garbage countries no doubt dislike being pushed around by the us they also don t like the continuous devaluation caused by printed the fake money that is the usd the only thing more unbearable for the other 140 odd countries in the world would be to have their own budgets constrained by real money so maybe the us is an abusive parent but no country can ever return to sound money not unless they abandon all social gibs budgetary black holes and ask the french how easy that is to do as mr rickards points out expectations of a global currency reset emanate from the fact that monetary policies across the globe are unstable and unsustainable that is an absolute fact but one has to be impressed with how long the system has lasted so far without collapsing one of these days the whole thing will crumble it literally has to but the bankers will obviously prolong it for as long as they can because their entire empire depends on it this is the main point jim rickards keeps making and he s not wrong my guess is that the longer they keep suppressing the price of gold and especially silver the more likely it is that the currency reset will be an absolute mind blower a mega shock probably happening so fast that the majority of people will never get the chance to get back into gold or silver 99 of people on the planet are going to get broadsided because they re not even close to being the slightest bit knowledgable about the monetary system one day we will wake up and find out that the us dollar will be re attached to gold at the rate of 25 000 to the ounce or maybe the us dollar will take the second seat to sdrs it won t really matter gold goes from 1200 to 25 000 in an instant and silver to 1 000 per ounce once that happens 99 95 of people on this planet will have missed the boat at least regarding physical mining companies will be the biggest play of all because they will probably rise in value non stop for a full decade if anybody doesn t understand why jpm has amassed the most massive hoard of pure silver in the entire history of the world they re not realizing that jpm is verifying what i just told you the fed and their puppets congress have refused to allow a full independent audit of all us gold reserves including leasing and all encumbrances last legit audit was during the eisenhower administration any of you gold haters wonder why hint the usa has no gold left and munuchin like all goldmanites is a stone liar if when china and or russia introduces a gold backed currency the dollar will collapse so hang on to your dollars you gold hating douche bags it will be fun to hear your screams when economic collapse will arrive deutsche bank lost a record of 5 7 billion in 2019 alone as germany is collapsing to recession the bank crash is getting closer deutsche bank is deep in the

private banking we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us deutsche bank also reported a loss of 832 million euros between july and september after the red of over 3 billion in the second quarter the restructuring plans are not taking off are you prepared for the imminent economic collapse we better hope that the u s economy holds together in 2020 because if there is any sort of major economic collapse much of the country is going to be broke almost immediately today close to half of all americans are living on the edge financially for many it is out of necessity but for others it is a conscious choice way too many people out there see no need to build up a substantial financial cushion because they have a tremendous amount of faith in the economic system they don t think that things will ever get too bad in this country and so there is no urgency to put funds away for a rainy day but even if authorities could somehow prevent an economic collapse from ever happening again individual emergencies are taking place all around us on a constant basis cars break down people get sick and accidents happen unfortunately most americans are completely unprepared for some sort of an emergency to strike in fact a brand new survey has discovered that just 41 percent of americans could cover a 1 000 emergency expense using their current savings so where would everyone else get the money for an emergency well most of them would either borrow the money or get it from a relative and usually an emergency costs a lot more than 1 000 the bottom line is that most of the country is living paycheck to paycheck and most americans are just one small step away from financial collapse back in 2008 economic collapse millions of americans suddenly lost their jobs and because so many of them were living on the edge financially a lot of them suddenly couldn t pay their mortgages you would think that we would have learned something from that very painful experience but we didn t so we better hope that the u s economy remains relatively stable because a serious downturn would be very ugly unfortunately an increasing number of experts are warning that our luck is about to run out in fact the head of the imf recently warned that we could potentially be facing another economic collapse and great depression that certainly doesn t sound good at all here in the united states most people have been choosing to ignore all the signs that the economy is starting to collapse but as stores and businesses continue to close down all over the nation it is going to become very difficult to ignore all of the empty buildings for example macy s just announced that they will be closing nearly 30 stores and one of the most prominent mall retailers in the entire country has just announced that they will be closing 91 stores of course i could go on and on all day here are just a couple more examples of major retailers that are closing down stores bed bath beyond is closing 60 locations with the list being revealed tuesday and schurman retail group plans to close its papyrus and american greetings stores totaling about 254 locations within the next four to six weeks but despite all of the evidence to the contrary the irrational optimists would still have us believe that america has entered a new era of tremendous economic prosperity i actually wish that was true sadly decades of exceedingly bad decisions are catching up with us in a major way and instead of changing course we continue to steamroll toward a date with destiny right now i am going to share with you the number one piece of advice that i give to everyone who asks about preparing for the great economic collapse that is ahead build up a financial cushion when things get bad you are going to need money i know that sounds exceedingly simple but obviously most of the country is choosing not to do this instead most of the country is surviving from month to month with barely any money in their bank accounts and so when economic disaster strikes they are going to be looking for someone else to rescue them we have had more than a decade since the financial crisis of 2008 to prepare for the next one but most people are acting as if the next one will never arrive unfortunately the truth is that the next crisiseconomic collapse has already started and businesses all over the nation are going bankrupt but most americans won t realize what is happening until things really start getting out of hand and by then it will be far too late to make any sort of preparations
india s hindu supremacist bharatiya janata party bjp government will unveil the state budget for the 2020 21 fiscal year today feb 1 amidst a deep economic crisis that has seen the growth rate fall sharply private investment collapse and unemployment reach a 45 year high compounding the government s predicament are contradictory demands from domestic and global capital and mounting social opposition since mid december india has been convulsed by mass protests against the bjp s newly adopted anti muslim citizenship amendment act or caa on jan 8 tens of millions of workers joined a one day general strike to protest the government s pro investor pro market policies social spending cuts privatization deregulation massive tax cuts for big business and the promotion of flexible contract labour jobs the narendra modi led bjp government has responded to the unravelling of the economy by stoking hindu communalism with the double aim of mobilizing the bjp s hindu chauvinist cadre as shock troops against the mounting social opposition and splitting the working class however growing working class anger over mass joblessness and stagnant and declining real wages is intersecting with mass opposition to the bjp s hindu supremacist agenda and flagrant attacks on democratic rights the biggest fear is if growth doesn t pick up it will spill onto the streets an unnamed senior government functionary told the indian express this week what looks as disaffection in some campuses may spread further for its part indian big business is awaiting the budget with bated breath the hope to use the words of the indian financial press is that it will revive the animal spirits of private investors with the growth rate now standing at less than 5 percent its lowest level since the 2008 2009 global crisis and investment growth at its lowest level in 17 years domestic capital is looking to the modi government for fiscal stimulus that is they want the government to boost spending on transport energy and other infrastructure projects so as to kick start the economy indian and foreign businesses are also seeking tax breaks and other incentives to boost their declining revenues and profits however the government s fiscal resources negligible when compared with those of the world s other major world economies have been further eroded by the economic crisis while modi and finance minister nirmala sitharaman insist the downturn is merely conjunctural and will soon pass economic experts are increasingly taking exception to these claims and pointing to the all sided interconnected character of the economic crisis domestic consumer and business demand for goods and services have essentially collapsed there are multiple reasons for this rural india is mired in poverty and a two decade long agrarian crisis bound up with the withdrawal of state support and investment workers incomes have been ravaged by unemployment wage cuts and the proliferation of low paid precarious jobs corporations and real estate companies are weighed down by the massive debts they incurred to finance growth in the past decade with many struggling to make even interest payments on their loans this in turn has crippled the financial sector the non performing assets of banks i e loan installments remaining unpaid for 90 days have ballooned consequently commercial credit which acts as the main source of new capital for indian businesses especially real estate and medium to small industries has all but dried up in 2019 india s central bank the reserve bank of india rbi slashed base interest rates by 1 35 percentage points to encourage commercial lending but the banks themselves mired in debts have refused to pass on the interest rate cuts starving the economy of funds as a result thousands of small and medium sized industries and businesses have shut down the rapid unravelling of india s economy has come as a shock to such representatives of global capital as the international monetary fund imf and the world bank they have long promoted india as a bright spot in the crisis ridden global economy despite the fact that more than 800 million indians subsist on less than 2 per day in contrast to domestic economists and big business and despite conceding to use the words of the imf s chief economist gita gopinath that the most recent adverse indian economic figures have surprised everyone the imf has sternly warned the indian government against increasing deficit spending to stimulate growth this is because india s budget projections for the 2019 20 fiscal year which ends march 31 are in a shambles the projected revenues from income taxes and the sell off of government assets are in steep decline according to an analysis by the mint business news website the total revenue of the government for the first 8 months of fiscal 2019 20 amounted to rs 9 83 trillion us 138 billion just 50 1 percent of the government projected rs 19 6 trillion 276 billion for the full year the mint estimates that the revenue shortfall for the full year will amount to rs 1 2 trillion 17 billion and that the real fiscal deficit will reach 5 5 percent of india s gdp against an originally projected 3 3 percent whilst the representatives of world finance and domestic business disagree over whether the bjp government should resort to fiscal stimulus they are in complete agreement that the crisis must be offloaded onto the working class capital is determined to put this crisis to good use and impose structural reforms aimed at increasing workers exploitation and corporate profitability they are pressing the modi government a most pliant and willing agency of big businesses to implement a further raft of pro investor big bang reforms what they are demanding is that the government gut all restrictions on layoffs and plant closures so as to create a more flexible workforce and make it easier for people to be displaced so that businesses can acquire land for industrial purposes they are also pressing for a fire sale of public sector units state owned businesses and various other sops to industries and financial speculators just a couple of years ago modi was proclaiming india s growth rate world beating now many economists are warning the country may be in the grips of stagflation that is the combination of anemic economic growth or worse with steep inflation the growth rate has fallen for the past three years while the inflation rate is now the highest it has been in six years the indian economy is being battered by slow world economic growth and by the trump administration s america first protectionist policies and trade war with china between april and december total exports fell 2 percent to 239 billion even more significantly while a central aim of indian state policy for the past three decades has been to transform india into a cheap labour producer and more recently a production chain hub for global capital india s exports as a share of gdp have slumped sharply whereas in 2013 non refined oil exports surpassed 14 percent of gdp they are now less than 10 percent these figures speak to the failure of the modi government s make in india campaign which aims to entice transnationals to invest and transform the country into a global manufacturing hub towards this end the government has created several special economic zones sez where normal labour and environmental regulations don t apply and businesses are accorded tax exemptions despite the modi government rolling out the red carpet to foreign businesses and its concerted efforts to exploit mounting us china tensions to entice companies to shift production from china to india the make in india campaign has found few takers a major reason for this is the poor public and social infrastructure including high levels of functional illiteracy primary goods such as gems and precious metals still account for a large share of india s exports in 2018 19 india s exports of high value goods such as machinery and automobiles totaled just 66 billion and accounted for only 1 73 percent of the world total of 3 8 trillion in high value goods exports india s share of overall world merchandise exports amounted to a mere 1 67 percent 323 billion out of 19 trillion many economists in india and internationally argue that india s economic situation is even graver than the government s figures suggest because the modi regime has played fast and loose with the numbers according to arvind subramanian the former chief economic advisor to the modi government india s growth rate has been at least 2 percent lower per year than claimed by the modi government since it first came to power in 2014 subramanian has also observed that commercial lending the source of almost all new capital has all but dried up and in the first 6 months of the current fiscal year amounted to a mere rs 1 trillion 14 billion
u s review fed keeps rates on hold as gdp growth remains sturdy real gdp grew 2 1 on an annualized basis in q4 in part due to a boost from net exports year to year real gdp is up 2 3 the fed left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged but slightly lifted the interest rate paid on excess reserves by 5 bps durable goods orders jumped 2 4 in december thanks to a surge in defense orders excluding defense orders fell 2 5 new home sales slipped 0 4 in december but ended the year up 10 3 compared to 2018 thanks to lower mortgage rates personal income grew 0 2 during december while personal spending advanced 0 3 fed keeps rates on hold as gdp growth remains sturdy the first week of the chinese lunar new year started off with coronavirus fears sending financial markets into a tailspin over the potential impacts of the worldwide spread of the virus on already weak global growth see topic of the week on page 7 however through the noise of the day to day market volatility economic growth in the u s continues to hold up fairly well real gdp grew 2 1 on a quarterly annualized basis during q4 a solid outcome which is roughly in line with the pace averaged over the past decade looking under the hood growth in q4 was boosted by a sizable 1 5 percentage point contribution from net exports as a modest increase in exports was offset by a steep decline in imports the threat of additional tariffs in december likely led many importers to pull purchases forward into earlier in the year which helps explain the dramatic decline that noted business fixed investment continued to be a drag owed to the combined forces of the trade war the boeing 737 max sidelining and a pullback in the energy sector however consumer spending remained firmly in positive territory and an upturn in government purchases provided some additional support furthermore lower mortgage rates spurred the second straight quarterly rise in residential investment residential construction and new and existing home sales have reversed course and are now on a positive trajectory new home sales slipped 0 4 in december but ended the year up 10 3 compared to 2018 the widespread improvement in the housing data can also be seen in the homeownership rate which climbed to 65 1 during q4 the highest since 2013 both housing and the broader economy should continue to be supported by lower interest rates moving forward the first fomc meeting of 2020 yielded no change to the federal funds rate with officials choosing to maintain the current 1 50 1 75 target range given the effective federal funds rate has been trading closer to the bottom of that range fed officials lifted the interest rate paid on excess reserves by 5 bps in order to incentivize commercial banks to keep more reserves parked at the fed and help keep the effective rate closer to the middle of the target range we expect the fed to hold off on any adjustments to the federal funds rate this year while business spending remains weak durable goods orders jumped 2 4 in december but excluding defense fell 2 5 we expect better days ahead as the fog of trade uncertainty begins to dissipate after it passed through both the house and senate president trump signed the usmca trade agreement on wednesday which should help along those lines in addition consumer spending should continue to be solid in the final month of the year personal spending rose a solid 0 3 meanwhile inflation continues to gradually move towards the fed s 2 0 target the pce deflator the fed s preferred inflation measure rose 1 6 year to year during december with sturdy gdp growth and modest inflation pressures the fed will likely be content on keeping rates on hold for the remainder of 2020 u s outlook ism manufacturing monday in december the ism manufacturing index sank to its lowest level since the recession and marked its fifth straight month in contraction territory we expect to see a turnaround in january s figures however for starters regional fed manufacturing surveys showed a net pickup in january while the preliminary reading of the markit index suggests activity continues to expand the ism index has undershot other pmis by a wide margin in recent months suggesting some catch up is due january brought with it a number of events that will likely trigger such a catch up the united states and china reached a phase i deal on trade while the usmca deal moved through congress and was signed into law this week both should alleviate some uncertainty surrounding trade policy and along with some stabilization in global manufacturing activity help push the ism up to 48 8 previous 47 2 wells fargo 48 8 consensus 48 5 ism non manufacturing wednesday although the ism manufacturing index garners more attention among the media and markets we view the ism non manufacturing index as a more telling barometer of the strength of the u s economy in recent months the gap between the manufacturing sector and all other industries has widened to the biggest gulf since 2015 the ism non manufacturing index has remained comfortably in expansion territory and indicates that spillovers from a weaker factory sector to other industries have been limited we expect the ism non manufacturing will be little changed in january and will continue to point to activity across the broader u s expanding at a decent rate the preliminary markit services pmi ticked up in january while regional fed readings on the service sector show activity has continued to firm since the summer previous 54 9 wells fargo 54 9 consensus 55 0 employment friday job growth likely improved in january coming in at a more trendlike 170k gain after employers added 145k jobs in december jobless claims have settled down in recent weeks while sub indices of regional purchasing managers surveys indicate hiring firming the kick off of the census year may give payrolls an additional small lift the january release will include the annual benchmark revisions to payrolls the preliminary estimates showed that there were 501k fewer jobs in march 2019 than is currently published the largest revision since 2009 more recent data will not be affected by the benchmark process but the weaker momentum of 2018 early 2019 could influence expectations for payroll growth going forward the unemployment rate will likely remain unchanged at 3 5 it is a close call on average hourly earnings growth but we expect a 0 3 gain for january and for the year ago change to tick back up to 3 0 previous 145k wells fargo 170k consensus 156k global review central banks on hold mexico s economy struggling this week both the bank of england and chilean central bank opted to keep policy rates unchanged political developments have weighed on both economies with brexit complications creating mixed sentiment towards the uk while social unrest is hurting economic activity in chile as of now we expect both central banks to stay on hold but acknowledge the dovish language from each set of policymakers mexico s economy has slowed notably over the last year with the economy contracting again in q4 indicating a full year contraction for 2019 growth prospects for 2020 remain dim as political uncertainty weighs on the country s outlook boe holds but suggests rates could move lower on thursday the bank of england boe convened to assess monetary policy with market participants split on whether the central bank would cut policy rates or keep them steady the boe ultimately opted to keep rates on hold at 0 75 however in our view boe policymakers were relatively dovish boe governor mark carney commented that uk economic data were good enough but noted that the uk monetary policy committee needs to see more evidence of a pickup in activity in order to avoid an interest rate cut in the future in addition there was dissent among boe policymakers with seven members voting for no rate change and two members voting for a cut the boe also released updated gdp and inflation forecasts which were also a bit dovish in nature indicating that boe policymakers expect growth to slow to below 0 50 while inflation is forecasted to tick up only modestly chilean central bank stays steady as protests calm the central bank of chile also opted to keep policy rates on hold at 1 75 this week while this was expected by market participants the decision still resulted in a sharp selloff of the chilean peso later in the week the chilean central bank has been in a tough place for months now as social protests erupted in the second half of last year immediately following the protests economic activity in chile contracted sharply sparking fear that chile could enter technical recession in q1 2020 the slowdown in chile s economy provides an incentive for chile s central bank to cut policy rates however given the selloff in the currency and how sensitive the peso is to political unrest the central bank has been cautious to adjust interest rates more recently protests have calmed as the administration has agreed to rewrite the country s constitution in an effort to address policies that likely contributed to large wealth disparity in the country the constitutional rewrite process will begin in april which we expect to be a bit contentious given the complexities that are involved and how violent the protests originally were as far as monetary policy it is possible the central bank could lower rates if the rewrite process sparks renewed protests and continues to weigh on economic activity mexican economy contracts again the mexican economy has been under duress for a while now with this week s q4 gdp print also underwhelming recent data indicate the mexican economy contracted 0 2 quarter over over in q4 the third quarterly contraction in mexico in 2019 this follows revised data in q3 indicating the mexican economy fell into technical recession in the first half of the year while also indicating the economy contracted for the entire year we can point to multiple explanations for the sharp slowdown in mexico high interest rates being one of them however we point to elevated political risks as the primary reason for the deceleration following president amlo s decision to cancel the construction of a major airport in mexico city corporations and investors alike have been extremely cautious to deploy money into mexico amlo s decision to halt auctions of mexican oil fields and lower oil production have also contributed while austerity measures have limited government spending which could spur gdp growth global outlook turkey inflation monday for the majority of 2019 cpi inflation in turkey had been on a downward trajectory a stable exchange rate and recovering turkish economy aided the deflationary process however with the central bank of turkey aggressively easing policy rates inflation has started to tick up slightly at its latest meeting the central bank again lowered its one week repo rate this time by 75 bps which has taken real yields in turkey essentially down to 0 in this context investors could be less incentivized to hold turkish lira which if this scenario were to materialize we would expect currency depreciation to fuel inflation and push prices higher in turkey the most recent commentary from central bank officials suggests rates could be on hold for now however given president erdogan s influence over monetary policy it is likely that interest rate could continue to move lower in the future lower rates could also spark renewed inflationary pressures in turkey previous 11 84 consensus 11 90 year over year reserve bank of australia monday the reserve bank of australia rba is set to make a decision on its cash rate target next week with consensus forecasts suggesting the rba will lower rates 25 bps should the rba cut policy rates 25 bps rates will be cumulatively 100 bps lower than they were at the beginning of 2019 there is justification for lower rates as inflationary pressures in australia remain muted while growth prospects are also relatively subdued in addition strong trade linkages with a decelerating china have weighed on the economy as well and have prompted rba policymakers to take measures to support the economy on the other hand australia s labor market remains strong with unemployment ticking lower in december while the pace of job creation remains strong a phase i trade deal between the u s and china could take some pressure off the chinese economy which would likely provide additional support for the australian economy previous 0 75 consensus 0 75 russia inflation thursday inflation in russia peaked around 5 5 year over year in march of 2019 however prices have steadily come down for the remainder of 2019 consensus forecasts also suggest that inflation will continue to move lower into 2020 this dynamic is a bit surprising as the central bank of russia aggressively cut policy rates last year lowering its key policy rate five times to 6 25 two possible reasons can explain lower inflation in russia one being the ruble s 12 5 appreciation over the course of 2019 with the other being the effects of an increase to the country s vat slowly wearing off with inflation pressures so muted the central bank has raised the possibility of lowering russia s inflation target which currently stands at 4 0 in our view the central bank will not opt to lower its inflation target as it could damage its credibility and market perception of its ability to manage inflation the central bank will meet again in early february where rates are expected to stay steady previous 3 0 consensus 2 5 year over year point of view interest rate watch january travails weigh on yields january proved to be quite a momentous month the financial markets had to maneuver their way through a number of extraneous events ranging from impeachment to the prospect of a broader conflict with iran the boeing 737 max production cuts and the coronavirus february will begin in earnest with the iowa caucuses and the presidential race kicking into high gear which looks like it will begin during sunday s super bowl advertising the sudden abundance of outside influences has pulled down interest rates with the yield on the 10 year treasury briefly falling below the three month t bill rate and currently remaining roughly 5 7 bps below the federal funds rate at 1 54 the bond market is more concerned about the economy than the fed is investors likely fear a repeat of the global slowdown that followed the tsunami and fukushima nuclear disaster which crippled global supply chains while the january fomc meeting policy statement was consistent with jay powell s refrain that there is a high bar for raising or lowering interest rates the financial markets currently suggest we are much nearer to meeting that high bar for another quarter point rate the bond market s heightened concern is likely due to the still worsening coronavirus situation in china while stocks have periodically sold off on reports of infections spreading beyond china we believe the drop in bond yields is mostly due to fears about what has already transpired in china in regard to travel restrictions and business shutdowns once conditions stabilize we would expect to see bond yields bounce back but that will still likely leave us with a fairly flat yield curve there were two other notable shifts in the policy statement the fed s assessment of consumer spending was modestly downgraded and the fed slightly ratcheted up their frustration with inflation remaining below 2 powell made it clear in his press conference that he was weary of the u s falling into the same deflationary trap that so many other nation have this suggest that the bar to a rate cut is probably not as high right now as the bar to rate increase credit market insights duration developments the years long trend of rising investment grade ig bond duration and falling highyield hy bond duration accelerated in 2019 duration a measure of the effective life of a bond based on its time to maturity coupon rate and yield last year rose around 12 to eight years among ig bonds and fell almost 25 to three years among hy bonds according to bloomberg barclays data this can be explained by the sharp drop in interest rates last year and differences in the supply demand of corporate bonds of varying credit quality in terms of supply when yields fall ig companies are eager to lock in that lower rate or term out their debt by refinancing as ig firms rollover five year bonds into 10 year bonds for example the effective duration of the ig market rises hy bonds on the other hand are much more likely to be callable as hy issuers call or buy back their bonds before the maturity date the average duration of the hy market falls as investors price in a shorter expected life duration can also be thought of simply as interest rate risk on the demand side investors appear to be content with shorterduration hy bonds as spreads remain near record lows but there is also healthy demand for high quality long duration ig bonds as many institutional investors need to match their long term liabilities the uptrend in ig duration and downtrend in hy duration are likely to continue absent a spike in yields which we do not expect topic of the week lessons from sars aside from the far more important human considerations of the more than 9 900 confirmed cases of the coronavirus globally and the 213 confirmed deaths we are charged with considering the economic impact as well while this remains a very fluid and uncertain situation we can look for lessons in a similar episode during the 2002 2003 sars outbreak which also originated in china and caused more than 700 deaths worldwide no comparison is perfect and this one is complicated by both china s economic ascent over the past 18 years and that the war in iraq was just getting underway in 2003 one lesson learned in that period was the need for a more active response from authorities in china and this time officials are clamping down hard on travel and extending the lunar new year holiday those needed measures will restrict more than travel however and we have dialedback our forecast for chinese gdp this year to 5 8 for the u s economy the knock on effects are most evident in consumer spending and interruptions in production due to supply chain constraints in 2003 consumer confidence was shaken and some categories of spending air travel for example posted sharp declines as the top chart shows durable goods outlays fell for a time but the weakness was only temporary as spending snapped back sharply provided the current episode does not become more widespread than the sars outbreak consumer spending will likely not be materially affected production outages in china may reverberate in u s factories output did slow briefly during sars bottom chart although the war may have been the larger factor in 2003 china s bigger role in today s world economy suggests a better period to consider is the fukushima nuclear disaster in march 2011 in japan but even this

a a by elie azar when rafic hariri was named lebanon s prime minister in 1993 following a white revolution and during the syrian occupation the lebanese bought into his vision when he brought his own team to improve the economy that was apparently an arrangement reached with the syrians whereby the syrians would be in charge of security and hariri would control the economy hence he named riad salameh as the governor of lebanon s central bank in developed countries central banks are typically headed by learned economists who possess a distinguished education and stellar experience in economics and monetary policy for instance us former chairman of the federal reserve alan greenspan had a ph d in economics from new york university and decades of experience as an analyst at the national industrial conference board a business and industry oriented think tank before his appointment by president reagan in 1987 hariri on the other hand appointed his own broker who only held a bachelor s degree in economics and no experience in monetary policy mr salameh was simply a financial advisor who had done well for himself and his client but should not have been entrusted with this sensitive position rather than acting as an independent leader who cared about the interest of lebanon and his people mr salameh acted as a broker who chose to exercise a monetary policy in accordance with hariri s vision which revolved around the idea of the inevitability of a peace deal in the middle east even though a peace agreement was unlikely and never materialized salameh kept relying on the same detrimental policies in fact to ensure that he remains in that position as long as possible he was submissive to the political allegiances rather than dictating and implementing a sustainable monetary policy for the benefit of the country mr salameh s first damaging decision as governor of the central bank was to support the issuance of government bonds at a 40 interest rate which doubled the national debt in two years he continued to yield to the political authority and its strategies helping politicians to carry out their personal and one dimensional agendas pm rafic hariri had based his economic vision on a farfetched peace process in the middle east therefore he did not alter his policies which were unequivocally destined to fail towards the end of the twentieth century the economic situation wasn t promising at all and lebanon like now was in dire need for fresh money because of the consistent deficit in the budget and trade balance this should have been a wake up call for all of the politicians in that era however rather than altering the monetary policy lebanon relied on borrowing and grants as such in 2000 after winning the parliamentary election hariri sought the help of then french president jacques chirac who in turn organized the paris i summit in 2001 followed by paris ii in 2002 and paris iii in 2007 the lebanese public ignore the fact that certain events after 2006 helped the trade balance and financed some of the government expenditure but unfortunately these events were not the product of a sound economic plan simply stated the increase in oil prices allowed lebanese expats in gulf countries to transfer large amounts of foreign currency to lebanon to be saved in lebanese banks which were paying interests higher than most banks in the world in addition money poured in from iraq the 2006 qatar donation following the israeli invasion and money that saudi arabia and iran sent to fund the parliamentary elections although paris iii saved lebanon from bankruptcy all other monies went to waste as mr salameh continued to use the same policy by encouraging banks to buy lebanese government bonds at high interest causing them to be exposed to the risk of government default a couple of weeks ago mr salameh went on tv to defend himself and deny any involvement in a ponzi scheme what is a ponzi scheme a ponzi scheme is a form of fraud in which belief in the success of a nonexistent enterprise is fostered by the payment of quick returns to the first investors from money invested by later investors investopedia this is exactly what mr salameh was doing in the last three decades to attract money from abroad in order to finance government debts mr salameh raised interest rates on dollar deposits very high reaching at times 14 while the equivalent international interest rate averaged between 1 and 2 additionally he pegged the currency to the dollar and reassured people that the debt is internal giving the impression that it was not very risky while in reality it certainly was and still is all this instead of diversifying banks investments to protect the depositary money salameh s reckless actions put the banks at high risk against the government default this constituted a ponzi scheme furthermore since assuming his role in the 1990 s salameh adopted hariri s policy in concentrating on tourism and real estate to encourage the flow of foreign currency to the country instead of encouraging agriculture new industries manufacturing and entrepreneurship opportunities which makes the economy diversified in order to flourish the façade he created concealed a crumbling financial system engineered to justify and defend an obsolete currency peg and inflated banking sector profits given the current banking crisis that might bring devastating consequences to the lebanese and as a governor of the central bank rather than using his independent power to work closely with the finance minister to create a task force and find solutions to lebanon s current financial problem as well as save the banks regardless of their mistakes and based on my belief that there is no economy without banks riad salameh only focused on his tv appearances to justify his shortcomings and whitewash his tainted reputation in reality his actions and lack of experience simply worked to postpone the implosion of the financial meltdown also when he blamed the political authority for his mishaps he inadvertently demonstrated his own failure as it is a known fact that the governor of the central bank is an independent official because the bdl does not fall under the jurisdiction of any state body except for the finance minister who can ask to look into the accounting resolving lebanon s financial crisis starts with identifying the primary problem restoring confidence in the banking system it will undoubtedly take time and serious effort to persuade people to start depositing money back into the banks additionally a comprehensive and long term economic reform must include drastic measures to a protect the banks by ensuring limited capital control b instating taxation laws on luxury items c revamping the economy by encouraging expatriates to re invest in lebanon and d establishing research and development centers the road to economic recovery is long and strenuous but definitely achievable with the right

asia coronavirus a pneumonia causing virus is beginning to disrupt the chinese economy although it s unclear whether the impact will extend to the full year this is likely to push china to step up stimulus to counter the disruption in the economy china s ministry of finance said that as of 5 pm on wednesday that finance ministries at all levels of government have issued 3 94 billion usd in subsidies for prevention and control of the virus the people s bank of china also emphasized it will tweak its monetary policy tools to ensure sufficient liquidity in the wake of a nationwide holiday

up for our wine club today did you know you can support the nation by drinking wine the government of ecuador reached an agreement on monday with leaders of the protests that have rocked the country for the last two weeks the deal which included the confederation of indigenous nationalities of ecuador conaie is a retreat for the government of president lenín moreno and a victory for the protesters jubilant crowds took to the streets chanting in celebration but the agreement doesn t resolve the underlying problems moreno is not likely to finish the remaining year and a half of his presidential term without a recurrence of serious unrest the protests started after the government ended fuel subsidies and began with a transport strike that blocked roads large student demonstrations and neighborhood protests followed and clashes with security forces were common tens of thousands and possibly hundreds of thousands of people participated they were massively disruptive and the government response was fierce security forces killed at least seven people arrested about 1 000 and injured a similar number moreno had declared a state of exception a curfew beginning at 8 pm and yet still had to flee the capital temporarily moving it from quito to the port city of guayaquil related article the imf s large brain unhealthy ego and tiny conscience lauren carasik amnesty international had demanded an immediate end to the heavy handed repression of demonstrations including mass detentions and swift independent and impartial investigations into all allegations of arbitrary arrests excessive use of force torture and other ill treatment the level of police repression shocked many in a country where security forces are not known for the use of excessive force the government also raided homes to arrest political allies of former president rafael correa including paola pabón the governor of the province where the capital quito is located this continues a disturbing crackdown which has included trumped up charges against correa himself and a number of former officials and the abuse of pretrial detention to force them into exile on monday the mexican embassy in quito offered protection to a number of pro correa political dissidents including legislators moreno agreed on sunday to rescind decree 883 which was part of a program agreed to in march with the international monetary fund imf the decree had cut subsidies to energy including gasoline and diesel fuel the resulting price increases had been substantial and were especially tough on poor people in rural areas according to press reports moreno on sunday was willing to reconsider the economic policies that spurred the protests review plans to cut salaries and vacations for

current issue view our current issue but other reports indicate that the moreno government will stick to the austerity and other commitments that he made to the imf in return for a 4 2 billion loan and that economic program is so deeply flawed that it is bound to cause more trouble as it is implemented in fact the imf has already acknowledged that the shrinking of the ecuadorean economy this year is a result of the budget tightening in its program this is a familiar pattern in imf loan agreements pushing the economy into recession or deepening a slowdown that is already happening with a promise that it will one day lead to a recovery in this case the imf program calls for a fiscal tightening of about 6 percent of gdp over the next three years we can imagine the recession and increase in unemployment that this kind of austerity would cause and what makes it even less rational is that the ecuadorean government is barely running a budget deficit just 0 3 percent of gdp according to the imf s latest estimate if we look at ecuador s public debt the imf s own debt sustainability analysis in its march loan agreement found it to be quite manageable the imf forecasts that the economy will return to very slow growth next year but this is based on unrealistic assumptions these include a large increase in capital inflows due to the program s restoring confidence in the economy and even some accounting errors in reality a recession is more likely and the agreement contains other regressive reforms that are sure to be unpopular including layoffs wage cuts regressive tax increases and pro employer changes in labor law where there is flawed economics there is often bad politics on october 11 us secretary of state mike pompeo issued an official united states response to protests in ecuador stating that the united states supports president moreno and the government of ecuador s efforts to institutionalize democratic practices and implement needed economic reforms for the trump administration the struggle in ecuador is part of its policy of containment and rollback to get rid of the left and center left governments that presided over the majority of latin america in the first decade of the 21st century and restore the status quo ante before he was elected in 2017 president moreno was the vice president of rafael correa who had implemented a set of institutional reforms and innovative economic policies that were quite successful poverty dropped by 38 percent and extreme poverty by 47 percent over the decade public investment including schools hospitals roads and electricity more than doubled as a percent of gdp as did social spending central bank policy was coordinated with the treasury and the government was even able to use quantitative easing despite having the us dollar as its currency the government also required banks to bring billions of dollars back to the country and taxed capital outflows correa s government showed the world that the boundaries for independent economic policy in a small middle income developing country were much wider than is often believed most of these changes are now being reversed at the same time moreno has allied himself in the region with the trump administration s foreign policy he took ecuador out of opec and the union of south american nations which had been a significant force for latin american independence to please washington he also revoked the political asylum and ecuadorean citizenship of julian assange violating the international treaties under which these were granted as well as ecuadorean law the moreno government s rejection of correa s successful economic policies is badly harming him politically at the international level the imf and related institutions like the world bank and inter american development bank have poured about 10 billion into ecuador but the accompanying austerity program has made that support worse than worthless it is the same thing they are doing with the largest imf loan ever to the right wing pro trump government of argentina where president mauricio macri will likely become another political casualty of imf policy in this month s election if moreno persists in following the imf program he will join macri on the long list of former heads of government whose political careers were ended with help from the imf
the most recent candidate endorsed by blue america nabilah islam sometimes stands out from the crowd because of her name which for old people doesn t sound like a name from the georgia suburbs others men remark not on her name but on her physical appearance what people don t realize at least not until they get to know her is that nabilah despite how she looks and what he name is is both an all american girl and a policy wonk during one of the endorsement interviews we were discussing her support for medicare for all and the green new deal she mentioned that voters in gwinnett and forsyth counties have been asking how you going to pay for it frequently fox news is a popular tv station there even among democrats we offered to introduce her to economist stephanie kelton who has been generously giving her time to help progressive candidates grapple with questions like that afterwards i asked nabilah to write about the experience this is what she had to say my first meeting with stephanie kelton by nabilah islam candidate ga 07 before the end of the year i had the pleasure of connecting with stephanie kelton for those of you who don t know stephanie is an economist professor of public policy former chief economist on the u s senate budget committee 2015 minority party staff and a leading proponent of modern monetary theory modern monetary theory is a macroeconomic theory that describes currency as a public monopoly for the government the argument is that the government should use fiscal policy to achieve full employment creating new money to fund government purchases stephanie is someone who is extremely generous with her time and has such great knowledge that she freely imparts on any candidates willing to listen what i came to understand through speaking her is a far better understanding of how modern monetary theory mmt works and why it should be applied to the policies that we progressives advocate for understanding mmt is essential advocating for policies like medicare for all a green new deal free public college and any other policies that republicans and centrists only argument is how are we going to pay for it governments are not people and their debt should not be treated the same it is healthy for a government to have debt and when inflation actualizes we issue bonds to reduce circulation stephanie also made a great point to me for every 10 dollars we invest in our economy as a government especially in communities that need it it only strengthens our economy even if that means only 1 dollar is returned republicans already practice mmt at their leisure when it s time for war detention centers private prisons or big ag they will write a blank check with their eyes closed the same goes for centrists when we want to bail out big banks no problem but when it comes down to protecting our most vulnerable making sure there s an educated electorate or protecting our planet the funds are never there stephanie s guidance was most helpful in regards to explaining the implementation of a green new deal yes it is expensive but what is the alternative the reality is the scientific community has dramatically underestimated the severity of the speed of climate change in america and around the world we must invest in green infrastructure and move to a renewable based economy we have to invest in protecting our frontline communities while doing all of this we create up to 20 million good paying union jobs this is where mmt plays a considerable role these are not funds that are spent into an abyss they are direct investments into our economy our country and will continue to be circulated so while deficit spending is a traditionally unpopular idea viewing this through the lens of mmt it causes stimulation i m very grateful for stephanie s time and expertise i strongly encourage people reading her work and watching her videos whenever possible the point is mmt is a practice that is already in place but selectively it s time we fix our priorities this is public money and it is time it is appropriately allocated while nabilah was getting a crash course in mmt she was also working on an initiative that could change the course of political history at least in terms of making it more feasible for working class men and women to be able to run for office almost a decade after the affordable care act was signed into law 27 5 million americans still lack health insurance nabilah islam 30 a progressive political organizer running in the very crowded democratic primary in georgia s 7th congressional district is among them islam has come up with a unique way to address her situation she s asking the federal election commission for help many from the working class are hesitant to run or can t do it full time because they can t afford to particularly when it comes to health insurance calling her atlanta s own aoc helaine olen covered nabilah s initiative for the washington post last week in a letter that will be filed next monday wrote olen islam is petitioning the fec for an advisory opinion that would permit her to use campaign funds to pay for health insurance her short term goal is medical coverage but in the long term this daughter of working class immigrants from bangladesh also wants the regulations changed so that more lower and middle income people can afford to seek public office in other words more people like herself running for congress is an expensive endeavor and often cost prohibitive for working americans islam wrote in her filing running for office while working even part time severely limits your ability to campaign effectively people with financial security are better positioned to campaign full time while living on their savings one result congress is hardly representative of the american public about 40 percent of members are millionaires compared with 3 percent of the u s population this isn t as islam points out simply because the rich hanker for political positions and power while their working and middle class counterparts do not it s because people who lack significant financial resources face structural barriers that make it harder to get in a race and stay in such as how to pay for health insurance islam explained during a telephone interview she initially thought she would hold down a part time position while competing for the congressional seat she found that impossible running for congress is a full time job she has instead put her student loans into forbearance and canceled her health insurance and is living off savings she knows she s taking a risk if something happens to me i could end up with thousands of dollars in medical bills but islam says she can t afford to do anything else the average cost of an individual policy in 2019 was more than 7 000 true islam was paying 120 a month there was a trade off involved in technical terms islam says her policy did not comply with the affordable care act in layman s terms that means it wouldn t have covered such events as the hospital bills if she got hit by a car while canvassing junk she called it monica klein the political consultant advising islam previously worked with long island s liuba grechen shirley who successfully petitioned the fec for permission to use campaign funds to cover her child care expenses klein told me she sees similarities between the two woman s quests like liuba nabilah isn t just running for office she said liuba and nabilah are both working to dismantle the conditions that keep congress overwhelmingly white wealthy and male but islam is unlikely to meet with similar quick results that s got nothing to do with the merits president trump hasn t bothered to nominate candidates to fill the three openings on the six member commission leaving the fec short of the necessary quorum needed to hold meetings or issue rules this is obviously a bigger issue than islam s request as jeff hauser the executive director of the revolving door project noted without a quorum campaigns seeking to push or shred the envelope of legality can do so bolstered by the certainty the fec cannot open investigations or issue fines but requests for rulings that come in during this period don t go away the fec will consider them when a quorum is restored islam s request could eventually make it easier for other less than privileged candidates to run for office that s a win no matter how islam ultimately performs i really believe that we need more people like me more people with my working class background who grew up with parents that worked low wage jobs islam said if there are more nabilahs in congress i assure you things like medicare for all things like a living wage 15 an hour would just be a no brainer
budget 2020 lays down a comprehensive framework to revive consumption and investment in the economy finance minister nirmala sitharaman said in an exclusive interview with rahul joshi group editor in chief and md network18 the fm said that signs of revival are already visible in the economy the recent data is pointing to a revival she said story continues below advertisement remove ad she commented on the tax changes introduced in the budget saying that the new structure makes tax compliance easier adding that the announcement of a new tax charter makes the government s commitment clear of easing taxation procedures the lack of big ticket announcements in the union budget meant the market reacted negatively but the fm said that since was not in full force today it will likely digest the full scope of the announcements and recover on monday she added that slippage on the fiscal deficit the government had targeted 3 3 percent deficit in fy20 and came in at 3 8 percent would not be a negative as the centre had been extremely responsible with its finances story continues below advertisement remove ad edited transcript q in some sense it was one of the most challenging times for you to present this budget gdp growth at an 11 year low private consumption at a 7 year low a whole set of macro numbers at historic lows what were you really thinking of when you were presenting this budget did you have to balance a lot of factors like keeping growth in mind on one hand and all the rest of it on the other a absolutely it was the desire of the government that we address every section which was expecting something out of the budget if possible our attempt was to make sure that we came up with something which would boost consumption put money for investments and creation of assets with private investment at a slow pace we did not want to at any point between july and now cut down on public investments on the contrary we have only increased it so the capex between july and now if you look at the data has only gone up so in a way we were very clear that while we were addressing the supply side issues it was time for us to make sure that consumption and also investment because we wanted to boost demand had to be kept up and that is the story story continues below advertisement remove ad q how has the budget addressed these two big concerns the demand side problem and the economy being investment starved how have these twin issues got addressed with your budget a that is one of the reasons why i started by saying private investment will do their own whenever they take their call on it we have shown our intention by cutting the corporate tax rate we have brought it down to the lowest level so we wanted to tell them we believe now that you will make decisions with such an attractive tax rates however from the other side from the government side we wanted to make sure that money was going for investment and that is why the prime minister s pm announcement on independence day red fort address he spoke about a rs 100 lakh crore in the next five years we didn t wait for the rs 100 lakh crore projects to come we ourselves spent a lot of time talking to states talking to different private sector people and putting together a pipeline of 6 500 projects some of which are greenfield some of which are brownfield but all of which if only attended through state governments or through private participation with central government can make a big difference to the entire environment one by creating the assets in the infrastructure sector and two by making sure that the cascading effect of that will bring in positive impact on industries like cement iron and steel and so on also employment opportunities to a lot of people if that is the way in which we wanted to make sure money was going for investment one investor facilitation centre is being started sovereign funds have in the last six months been contacting us because they see india as a positive investment destination they want to come and invest in india for them we had to keep the pipeline ready no point if they reach here and then search for projects more than that we have also given them concessions in our fiscal policy we have given them tax concessions and while giving the tax concessions specified that if they were going to spend it in infrastructure lock in period being a certain number of years three years we will give them the concession all this has been tied up so we are not talking today for it to happen some years later everything is kept ready it should all start playing out soon q i will come back to this point a little later i want to ask you a broader question do you see the economy as having bottomed out we are seeing projections of the gdp growth rate of 6 6 5 percent how do you see the economy and when do you think it will start reflecting in a turnaround in the first half or in the second half of the next fiscal a i thought some of the data which has been released and the kind of common speech you hear from international observers and also the indian industry themselves are all very clearly indicating that negativity with which people spoke about india immediately after the july budget they must have had their reasons i am not faulting them for it but the negativity with which they spoke the sentiment about which they were referring to have all now gone away at least i have not heard them speak about it i can see some of the data which is coming through showing there is a turnaround so i have a feeling that if we keep up this pace of listening to the industry keeping in touch with them and responding to them i think we will possibly be moving towards a very constructive phase one of course at the same time also has to watch what impact all those interventions which we have done have had q where do you see the green shoots in the economy the former finance minister today said that 6 6 5 percent is not only an astonishing figure it is also an irresponsible figure being given by the government a i would have thought that this budget if anything has really put in a lot of work to show that we mean every number that we have stated q will the budget really stimulate rural demand i think one of the things that everyone was looking forward to in this budget was how rural demand will get stimulated so what are some of the specific things you feel will do that a the fact that after due consideration nearly 3 lakh crore been allocated for agriculture and rural development put together there are the various specific schemes which the prime minister has been talking about and the focus on aspirational districts backward among some of the states which are doing well and backward among those which are not probably doing so well about 112 of them have been chosen we are looking at building hospitals there getting two tier and three tier cities in those aspirational districts also to pick up bringing in self help groups shgs as a backward linkage for aggregation in rural produce making sure the coastal fishing villages will have their own fish farmer producer organisations fpos bringing the nabard and mudra to the rural areas to give them more of such loans with which the farmers issues will be addressed where silos can be built at taluka level these are things with which we think the rural issues can be meaningfully addressed q why do you think the markets are disappointed with your budget have they not understood it in its full sweep sensex is down 1000 points nifty down 300 points were they looking for a big stimulus in sectors such as infrastructure real estate non banking financial companies nbfcs a rs 100 lakh crore five years but i have said the moment there is a requirement i am ready to frontload it the first line itself is i am willing to frontload it i have given the pipeline q is there provision in this budget for that a pipeline investment numbers have been very clearly put rs 22 000 crore has already been given for those two companies which are going to do long term investment in infrastructure funding so all this is in any case today to be fair the stock market was not in full force they were there but many of those concerned wings within the stock markets have not all been functional it is only on monday when they have to i am very confident the stock market will understand every aspect of what i have said in this budget and the kind of push that i have given for bond market for deepening the bond market for strengthening the bond market and making sure that india understands that there is one world out there which has still not been exploited fully these are things which i am sure that the markets will understand and respond on monday q you are hopeful that the bond market will react positively to the budget a of course there has never been these many steps taken for bettering the bond market q you are also banking a lot on foreign investment you made it easier for sovereign wealth funds to invest in infrastructure fpis can invest more in debt now up from 9 percent to 15 percent what was the thinking behind this a only because it is possible now you already have a lot of cases of banks and other such institutions in fact many nbfcs themselves raising funds from outside they are doing it because they think the cost of borrowing is far lesser when they do it from outside and understandably so it is possible for us to be able to encourage many such borrowing from outside and therefore make the indian savings be available for many others who cannot go out to borrow so whilst opening it up you are making sure that there is credit availability both from borrowing outside and also from inside the cost of capital also will come down once you are able to get it from outside q i will go back to the point you were making earlier about this push to infrastructure you talked about this rs 100 lakh crore to be invested over five years are you confident that this will be done over a five year period and that the pm s dream of a 5 trillion economy would be realised by 2024 a absolutely because see projects and their absorption capacity also doesn t happen within one year they spread the cost as the project gets executed in stages you get more and more resource requirement which goes in and therefore to spread it over five year is not so much from our end saying we don t want to spend now we will stagger it it is more the absorption capacity of the project itself even they will take their own time to take more and more even the funds are available they can only take a certain level at any point of time q the economy will grow in double digits to be able to get there in five years or will we have to push this deadline a i am making all the necessary steps to give that stimulus to the economy q let me come to the fiscal deficit the fiscal deficit has slipped yet again to 3 8 percent my first and direct question is will it lead to a downgrade in india s sovereign rating is there a potential risk of that a i do not see that at all because we have been very responsible about the way in which we have used the forbearance in the fiscal responsibility and budget management act frbma the act provides for forbearance of 0 5 percent we have not crossed that the numbers that we have given different heads different places different numbers are all responsible numbers i have even made a mention as to why my numbers this time given the fact that i have used the forbearance are well within the framework so i do not see india s ratings coming down because we have breached the fiscal number in fact we have complied with the framework given to us if i do not do that and if i am stubborn about a number that i have in today s situation i am expected to spend more how will i do that unless i use the escape clause which is available for me i have not violated that q the nbfc sector which is a major source of credit also for the economy is in serious trouble what are the steps that you are going to take to assure investors the market that you are working towards solving this big problem a haven t i made a mention that there will be first of all before the budget we had given a partial guarantee scheme for them that they can pool their assets first 10 percent will be supported by us the stock cap will be given by the government all that has been used by several of them the reserve bank of india rbi is constantly reporting on how that is developing even now what we have done is to be able to bring in the msmes so that they do not burden the system and liquidity is available for nbfcs we have now announced that that kind of a facilitation will be done for the nbfcs also so we have not ignored the liquidity requirement of the nbfcs q markets seem to be disappointed probably long term capital gains was one expectation that did not happen do you see in the future today budget is not the only day when you make all the announcements would you be looking at more market friendly measures in time to come which will give them more confidence a do you think the market has seen the ddt having been removed from the companies q that was one thing that they were expecting would happen a so it has happened q on the personal income tax front on the one hand you have delighted the middle class by showing the cuts are deep and that they are serious and that you mean business but on the other hand tax experts say that what you have given from one hand you have taken away from the other because the exemptions will go away a there are some exemptions which will continue even in the new some of them q the analysis seems to suggest that if somebody is not invested anywhere there are no exemptions it is a definite positive for them but otherwise it has become more complicated you can choose between one or the other and i suppose next year you can move from one to the other as well and come back to it so doesn t it complicate a no it doesn t ultimately in india we want a simple easy to comply and lower rate of tax a taxation system which is easy to comply with over the decades i did say that in my budget speech more than 120 exemptions are available on the liste now if you are a tax payer and looking at 120 imagine what you have to choose from and does that help you i fail to understand one point the incentive given for people for saving i have given the money back in your hand don t pay tax to me and that money in your hand you as an adult earning your wages or salary or profit or whatever is a rational individual to make a call on how you want to use that money spend it or save it so to put this argument to me back saying incentive to save would be gone away i find it very patronising that a tax payer wouldn t be mature enough to take his own decision on his money q in fact it might open up more avenues of investment for him a absolutely q so is that the idea because the savings have been coming down over the last 3 or 4 years a it should be the choice of the income tax payer as to where he wants to spend his money or keep his money it should also give the comfort to the tax payer that the system is simple eventually if not today some time i would want to see government of india removing all the exemptions like they do in many of the progressive societies and if that has got to be done it is no good if i say it will happen sometime in 5 years i have taken the first step towards it q but you will eventually move towards replacing it with the new tax regime which is simple which is simplified a and which benefits everyone i have given numbers in the speech itself to say if you were in the old tax regime and if you are in the new what is it that you gain you still gain nearly rs 78 000 if you are in the rs 15 lakh bracket by being in the new system even if you were using some of the exemptions in the old system and by you coming into the new which has very few exemptions given to it you are still better off so i am giving an option i am not forcing you to come here q but over a period of time it will be simplified a that is right q would you follow this for higher slabs as well is the philosophy the same simplify increase compliance and lower the rates a philosophy is the same q so even in higher slabs we can expect this in the next few years a i do not want to speculate on that now but now the intention is reach the money to those who need to have them reach the money for those who want to spend them reach the money for those who want to have money in their hand to take a call on what they want to do with it the middle class we reach them first eventually yes we will look at others also q your aggressive disinvestment number and largely on the back of the lic ipo a not largely on the back of lic q you are getting rs 120 000 crore from the usual privitisation and the rest of it rs 60 000 crore maybe from lic and idbi what i want to understand is will you be able to achieve this number how confident are you of getting through air india container corporation of india concor shipping corporation of india sci do you think all this will happen in the coming year a it should happen because i announced something in the july budget to be fair how quickly does the government machinery move between july and february they have done all the footwork they need to do for reviving the sale of air india looking at concor looking at sci you have listed it all and in the meanwhile also attending to something totally different from it the etf exchange traded fund which is not a disinvestment but they are looking at the etf through the etf they have shown success as well for a government department to move on these fronts so quickly i announced it in july and i am conceding that within this financial year i may not get the benefit from it but yes it will happen in the next q so will you be able to meet your target this year a no that is the point i am making they have done all the footwork i do not see it getting done before march 31 although i did say i want this happening before the end of march the extent of footwork that they had to do look at the fresh terms of conditions and so on so it will move q but because of this footwork next year you will be able to do rs 2 10 000 crore that you are confident of a that is right q the other interesting scheme is vivaad se vishwas scheme how much are you planning to mop up from this your earlier scheme for indirect taxes has been a hit you have been able to garner a substantial amount in just four months if i remember right about rs 40 000 crore so what is your expectation from this a i have a feeling that people are fed up of litigation and they have been waiting for a scheme this is not amnesty i am very clearly telling them that they have to pay the disputed tax amount but what we are willing to completely forego is the penalty on it the interest on it the interest se upar interest on it and so on provided they join it before march 31 2020 i am giving two full months on it if you miss march 2020 yes till june you may do it but that would be on a slightly different rate of some more money to be added to it so i am very clear at least from the way in which between july and now i have been meeting with a lot of people all over the country in talking with them about taxation the harassment that they tell me they undergo and so on that they are looking for a decent option to close this whole chapter q the money stuck is huge i think close to rs 650 000 crore a that s right neither they nor government benefits from it q so you are hopeful to get the big number this year itself by march 31 a i guess so q another question that even the former finance minister arun jaitley raised last year it was very nice of you to bring him in today a very personal touch there last year he spoke about investigative adventurism today you spoke about the same thing as well you said that tax harassment will not be tolerated at all a we have come with a charter tax payer s charter which is getting enshrined in statutes we will probably be the fourth country in the whole world which usa canada australia are the only 3 as much as i know who have got a charter so no good for us to go on saying that we trust the taxpayer we are showing it in action we are putting it into the law q but from what you say and what is happening on the ground is pretty different every other day we hear of tax raids ed and cbi raids and this is impacting business sentiment in some sense what would you say to that a that s exactly the point i am telling the intent of the government is not just to go on saying now we are proving it that we are enshrining it in the law itself that tax payers will have to be given a certain assurance that we respect them but one line i would take this opportunity to say if there is a very substantial reason to pursue somebody because of money laundering i cannot now tell my agencies to sit back and say no no it is giving a bad impression they will have to keep doing their lawful job if there is evasion if there is money laundering i cannot for the life of me think that i should look the other way and not enforce law i want to draw that fine distinction between harassment which should not happen but pursuing wrong doers q another point it is not related to the budget directly but we have seen a lot of caa protests in the country over the last few weeks we have also seen a lot of international press turning against india do you think it impacts business sentiment and will it hamper at some point capital flows into the country a i don t think so because the data in the last 2 3 months show that the flow is continuing in fact many of the sovereign funds have been enquiring with us as to where they can put their money i have announced some concessions for them i don t think it is affecting india s image because we may have started late but we have very clearly explained that it goes against nobody and it doesn t question the citizenship of anybody it does a lot to give citizenship and not remove citizenship and it is something which suited all political parties when they were in power they gave assurances but they didn t fulfil it this is not something which we have come to do today without taking the mandate of the people on it we have put it in our manifesto many other parties have also put in their manifesto we have gone to the public seeking vote inclusive of this point and we have got the mandate are we to do the job or not so i don t think we have done anything as a surprise q the other point about corporate india leaders sometimes complaining about micro management at the highest level tata chairman n chandrasekaran recently even said that supervision is good but suspicion is not i know that you also have been meeting a lot of corporate leaders over the past few months what would you say to corporate india s captains who are looking to you for guidance a the faceless assessment is one of them there is not going to be human interface now in tax related matters it is all going to be using technology artificial intelligence and big data we are going to use all of them so see where there is an element of suspicion even then we are going to only ask questions through digital mode we are giving a number for everything so that it is centrally generated and at the local level no discretionary settlement happens so all this is towards establishing credibility of the system q today you have in your budget raised custom duty on a host of household items are you finally listening to your core voter base who has been really upset since demonetisation has really struggled after demonetisation a i don t think there is a directly link between demonetisation and this step this is a step where very clearly indian msmes were producing good quality goods which are end products they are not raw materials but household goods which were all being marketed and sold by them and are now being cheaply dumped into india at half the cost of production they are not intermediary products they are not raw materials and they are not inputs for downstream industries if these which are being produced by our msmes cannot be protected against a massive dumping which is happening at throwaway prices how can be protect our own industries so i think it is important that this be seen not as a protectionist measure but very clearly a measure where dumping unparalleled extent of dumping has to be contained q is that the same thinking that reflects in your dealings with ecommerce companies and the royal cold shoulder to jeff bezos in india the deep discounting that these companies are doing which is hurting the small trader a this is more on the goods which are coming q it is a different point that i am making is the thinking the same the small trader is getting hurt because of deep discounting and some practices by ecommerce companies a not just the small trader but indian manufacturers too are not finding a place trader of course comes afterwards both of them are suffering yes all this has a bearing on your economy doesn t it

tougher for everyone china coronavirus 2019 ncov may not be much worse than a bad flu the world health organisation who has declared the coronavirus to be a public health emergency of international concern in a statement commending china for its response there are now 213 deaths in china out of c 10 000 confirmed cases putting the mortality rate at a very preliminary 2 2 though we are sure this is an overestimation we know the virus is spread substantially through china which might normally be expected to cause several thousand deaths reality is that there are probably around 500 000 infected cases by now according to a chart of predicted cases by imperial college and the university of hong kong we will not have a clear picture of the mortality rate for a few weeks but we suspect the mortality rate will be significantly under 1 slowing the infection rate down will buy time for the development of tests and vaccines with a first vaccine likely within the next two to three months in a crude attempt to create some sort of perspective c 1bn people catch the flu annually causing around c 5m fatalities globally severe cases normally run at around 0 5 of infections on which deaths run at 13 of severe cases and 0 07 of all cases if we compare this with the c 7 000 currently confirmed coronavirus cases leading to c 200 fatalities then we could infer a mortality rate of 3 of severe cases against the flu s estimated 13 globally there are around 700 000 deaths from influenza flu annually the coronavirus would therefore be substantially less dangerous than influenza in the us china normally charges patients and their families for healthcare causing many people to stay away from hospitals and physicians which will also skew the number of presenting cases the head of the

owned by arc minerals through its holding in zamsort arc minerals continues to report impressive copper results from drilling on their cheyeza prospect at the western end of the copperbelt in zambia the results are near surface indicate the presence of a high grade core to the mineralised zone and show impressive intersection lengths mineralisation starts at just 7 5m down the hole from surface at drill collar chdde058 grading 0 61 copper over 68 75m with three higher grade sections within the drill hole the target is some 3 000x800m in scale according to its soil anomaly drilling shows mineralisation covers 300mx750m so far with good potential for further drilling to significantly extend the scale of the prospect cheyeza is the first of 14 targets identified management have signed

grading 0 71 copper from 18 00m down the hole this long intersection follows on from other increasingly long sections of mineralisation reported in drilling in recent months while the sections reported are not true widths they do represent very good shallow intersections of copper with significant copper grade there are also a significant number of intercepts running at 1 copper conclusion drilling continues to show good potential for an economic copper project at cheyeza east copper intersections are all relatively close to surface with grades that will be the envy of many other copper miners and explorers recent results significantly raises the scale of the resource being evaluated recommendation we recommend arc minerals due to its potential for a major copper discovery at the cheyeza project in zambia the potential value of a significant copper discovery is likely to be a multiple of the current market capitalisation with the market recognising the value of the discovery

warning signal of a recession within a year or so though the track record isn t perfect economists are scrambling to calculate the virus s impact on china s economy the chinese economy is far bigger and more closely integrated with the rest of the world than it was at the time of the sars outbreak 17 years ago china now accounts for 16 percent of global economic output up from 4 percent in 2003 ben may director of global macro research at oxford economics estimates that the virus will shave 0 4 percentage points off chinese economic growth this year leaving it at 5 6 percent the slowest since 1990 and reduce global growth by 0 2 percentage points to 2 3 percent the weakest since the financial crisis others expect a repeat of the sars experience a quarter or two of weaker chinese growth followed by a quick and full recovery with limited fallout worldwide advertisement history suggests that unless the end of the world is going to be caused by this flu like virus it will prove

and good day to all of you participating around the world we appreciate you joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results for 2019 let s begin with slide 3 and review some highlights in 2019 lyondellbasell s businesses extended our outstanding track record of cash generation by delivering 5 billion of cash from operating activities over the past six years our resilient business portfolio has steadily produced 5 billion to 6 billion of cash each year under a variety of oil prices and macroeconomic conditions our company s focus on operational excellence cost management and technology driven growth has proven that we have an advantage across a range of business climate 2019 earnings were 9 58 per share with 5 7 billion of ebitda this represents a decline of approximately 20 and 17 respectively relative to the prior year despite healthy consumer driven demand our profitability was impacted by soft industrial demand as trade uncertainty regulatory changes and a weak environment for capital investment challenged the automotive industry and other durable goods markets for our products our global asset footprint and operational flexibility enabled us to adapt to changes in trade lanes while continuing to leverage the advantage of abundant low cost natural gas liquids as feedstocks for production from both our north american operations and our middle east joint ventures our technology business achieved record revenues from licensing plant designs to support growth in china resulting in the most profitable year in the company history for this segment before we get further into the results i would like to introduce our new chief financial officer and executive vice president michael mcmurray michael brings extensive knowledge and perspective to the company after working in finance investor relations treasury and as a cfo over the course of more than 30 years i m looking forward to michael providing our finance and strategy groups with the leadership that will drive our continued success michael welcome to lyondellbasell michael mcmurray executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you for the kind words bob i m excited to be part of lyondellbasell and your partner in driving our future in my first several weeks in the company i m very impressed with the people and results oriented culture within the company i look forward to meeting all our stakeholders and the investment community in describing how we will continue our disciplined approach to value driven growth while driving shareholder returns bhavesh v patel chief executive officer thanks michael let s turn to slide 4 and review our approach to maximizing the returns from our cash generation over the past year we continue to actively manage our business portfolio with value driven growth investments to develop opportunities around the world on the us gulf coast we completed construction of our new hyperzone polyethylene plant and increased activity to build our po tba plant as hyperzone production ramps up this year and the po tba plant reaches completion next year both projects will provide growth in volumes and profitability that will further increase our capacity for cash generation the box on the right summarizes work to expand our footprint in the rapidly growing asian market during 2019 we announced that our joint venture in thailand will begin construction of their fourth polypropylene plant that will reestablish their position as the largest polypropylene producer in southeast asia in september we signed an mou with bora to build an integrated cracker in northeast china and in december we announced our intention to expand our existing partnership with sinopec to build a second propylene oxide and styrene monomer plant also in china all of these projects leverage lyondellbasell technologies in our core businesses to extend our positions and expand in the world s fastest growing markets with the disciplined investments we are achieving growth while providing substantial returns for our shareholders on slide 5 you can see that our company has maintained our focus on delivering top quartile safety performance as we integrated the employees contractors and assets from the a schulman acquisition in 2019 we were able to reduce the injury rate at these facilities by more than 50 relative to the prior year our goal remains zero injuries we re diligently working to ensure all our employees contractors assets and the communities in which we operate finish the day in the same or better condition than when they started in october 2019 we announced the latest step in our progress to utilize plastic waste in the circular economy we re building a pilot plant facility at our research center in ferrara italy to develop our proprietary moretec technology to convert mixed plastic waste into new polymers as shown on slide 6 moretec will use catalysed hydrolysis to convert plastic waste into hydrocarbons that can be used as feedstocks to produce new plastics from existing olefins crackers and polymerization plants we will develop moretec technology in our pilot facility and optimize it toward a commercial scale moretec is complementary to lyondellbasell s existing mechanically recycled product business that relies upon clean and sorted waste streams together with our bio based circulen polymers our company now has three technologies that are advancing the business of circulen plastics with that i ll turn the call over to michael who will lead us through several topics relating to our financial performance michael mcmurray executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you bob let s begin on slide 7 where you can see the trends of our company s ebitda and eps over the past three years 2019 results include a one time non cash tax benefit of 85 million that increased earnings by 0 24 per share integration cost related to the a schulman acquisition impacted full year net income results by 89 million or 0 26 per share and fourth quarter results by 29 million or 0 08 per share as bob mentioned our profitability was impacted by challenging market conditions during 2019 using third quarter 2019 results as a benchmark our resilience relative to our industry peers during these challenging times is noteworthy while our peer s profitability fell as much as two thirds lyondellbasell s global business portfolio performed relatively well with approximately two thirds for our asset volume serving non durable demand from consumer markets our businesses are generally well positioned during industrial downturns slide 8 illustrates the consistent and efficient cash flow performance that bob mentioned earlier our businesses have generated 5 billion to 6 billion of cash from operating activities over the past six years in 2019 87 of our ebitda translated into cash with approximately 1 billion dedicated to sustaining capital our free operating cash flow yield remained healthy at 12 5 in 2019 please turn to slide 9 and allow me to review our capital allocation strategy our approach remains consistent with the policies we articulated last september at our investor day and frankly for the past several years we seek to provide balance between value driven growth and shareholder returns we remain committed to a strong and progressively growing dividend our capital expenditures are focused on ensuring our assets maintain their high levels of reliability as well as profitable growth with the completion of the hyperzone in po tba projects our growth capex will taper down our cash generation provides flexibility for highly selective value driven m a growth through jvs and opportunistic share repurchases at the same time we are mindful about maintaining appropriate leverage ratios and our commitment to a strong investment grade balance sheet underlies all of our decisions now please turn to slide 10 where you can see that our businesses generated 1 2 billion of cash from operating activities during the fourth quarter which contributed to 5 billion of cash generation for the year capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were approximately 730 million with roughly 60 invested in profit generating growth projects and 40 dedicated to sustaining capital our investment in growth has increased since the second quarter of 2019 as we completed our hyperzone polyethylene plant and continued to move our po tba plant construction forward in the fourth quarter we paid 351 million in dividends in 2019 our opportunistic buyback strategy allows us to repurchase 43 million shares for a total of 3 8 billion together with dividends returned a total of 5 2 billion to shareholders in 2019 along with that thought i would like to compare our capital returns to some of our peers over the prior four quarters please turn to slide 11 the dark blue bars depict dividend yield which was nearly 5 over the trailing 12 months prior to the fourth quarter together with share repurchases our company tops the chart with 20 of total cap returns to shareholders before i turn the call over to bob let me address some of your annual modeling questions for 2020 on slide 12 regarding capital expenditures we are planning to invest approximately 2 4 billion during 2020 to support both our sustaining capital and profit generating projects approximately 1 3 billion is targeted towards profit generating growth the majority of this growth investment in 2020 will be dedicated to the construction of the po tba plant in houston we continue to expect a meaningful reduction in capital spending in 2022 after the completion of this facility for 2020 we have a fairly typical planned maintenance schedule activities during the year are expected to impact annual ebitda by approximately 155 million our o p americas segment will have a cracker turnaround overlapping the first and second quarters of this year that is expected to impact ebitda by 25 million and 30 million respectively our o p eai segment will have a cracker turnaround in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 that is expected to impact ebitda by 15 million in each quarter in our intermediates derivatives segment we have planned maintenance events that will impact ebitda by approximately 10 million in each of the first and second quarters and 25 million in each of the third and fourth quarters this year our cash interest expense for 2020 is expected to be 420 million which includes capitalized interest of about 120 million 2020 annual book depreciation and amortization is forecasted to be 1 5 billion we plan to make regular pension contributions in 2020 that total approximately 120 million and we estimate a pension expense of 100 million we currently expect a 2020 effective tax rate of approximately 20 for the cash tax rate in the mid teens i will now turn the call back to bob for a more detailed discussion of our segment results bob bhavesh v patel chief executive officer thank you michael let s turn to slide 13 which illustrates our quarterly profitability over the last five quarters ebitda for the fourth quarter was 1 2 billion as you have seen lyondellbasell s business portfolio typically follows a seasonal trend with peak earnings occurring mid year in the absence of external catalysts that improve or detract from our underlying businesses the pattern seen in 2019 are fairly typical we have a focused and well balanced business portfolio supported by our global footprint feedstock flexibility and reliable operations these are recurring themes for our company and attributes that we seek to improve upon as we manage the portfolio even in uncertain market conditions our company continues to demonstrate resilience we talked last quarter about polyethylene spreads being near 10 year lows and on slide 14 we ve expanded that idea to illustrate the market margins associated with some of our major products each market has experienced several cycles over the past 20 years most recently we are faced with slow industrial demand and uncertainty in trade policies margins are currently relatively strong for north american polypropylene and for mtbe on the flipside we re seeing historically weak margins for styrene and northeast asian polyethylene some of you may be surprised to learn that globally we sell higher volumes of polypropylene and oxyfuels than polyethylene and styrene these charts illustrate how our portfolio provides balance where our product and trough margins is often offset by another with strong margins within the portfolio with these natural hedges across our global footprint and our innovative technology cost advantage operational flexibility and consistent underlying consumer driven demand lyondellbasell is well positioned to provide resilient profitability with the market conditions in line let s review our fourth quarter segment results starting with our olefins and polyolefins americas segment on slide 15 fourth quarter 2019 ebitda was 498 million 155 million lower than the third quarter profitability was impacted by reduced polyethylene margin from typical winter seasonality and an increased cost of ethylene production as feedstock costs were higher and propylene price was lower compared to the previous quarter olefins results decreased approximately 20 million compared to the third quarter of 2019 margin contracted on relatively higher natural gas liquid feedstock cost and lower propylene price volume increased after the completion of our planned maintenance at our clinton iowa facility during the third quarter combined polyolefin results were approximately 135 million lower than the third quarter primarily due to a decline in polyethylene spreads over ethylene of more than 130 per ton for the full year results decreased by 460 million olefins results increased as we utilize the high feedstock flexibility across our fleet of six us ethylene crackers to take advantage of low cost feedstocks combined polyolefins results declined primarily due to the spread decline in polyethylene of approximately 260 per ton we expect the remainder of the first quarter will follow typical seasonal trends with increasing demand continuing into the second quarter now please turn to slide 16 to review the performance of our olefins and polyolefins europe asia and international segment during the fourth quarter ebitda was 144 million a decrease of 147 million compared to the third quarter ethylene margin declined as a result of higher feedstock costs and lower propylene price with typical fourth quarter seasonality pressuring volumes there was little support to increase polyethylene price olefins results decreased approximately 140 million primarily driven by higher feedstock costs and lower propylene price combined polyolefin results decreased approximately 45 million driven by decreased spread in both polyethylene and polypropylene full year ebitda was 101 million lower than 2018 results included an impact of approximately 55 million due to a decrease in the euro versus the us dollar exchange rate relative to 2018 olefins results for the full year increased due to lower feedstock costs and improved reliability with planned and unplanned maintenance impacting the fourth quarter of 2018 combined polyolefin results and joint venture equity income decreased due to lower polyolefin spreads in europe we expect typical seasonal improvements as we progressed through the first and second quarters similar to the americas please turn to slide 17 and let s take a look at our intermediates derivatives segment fourth quarter ebitda was 329 million a decline of 61 million from the third quarter 2019 well supplied markets drove margin declines in most businesses for both propylene oxide and derivatives and intermediate chemicals fourth quarter propylene oxide and derivatives results decreased approximately 10 million due to lower margins from our product sales mix intermediate chemicals decreased 50 million primarily due to reduced margins oxyfuels and related products results were relatively unchanged with the strongest fourth quarter for the company over the past five years during 2019 ebitda declined 454 million compared to the record performance we achieved in 2018 margin declined in most businesses primarily styrene partially offset by strong improvement in margins for our oxyfuels and related products businesses volumes for most businesses also declined due to planned and unplanned maintenance as well as a softer market in january mtbe raw material margins have trended downward but are still relatively strong for this month compared to recent years as the first quarter progresses we expect well supplied markets to continue to pressure most of our ind businesses recently we announced our intention to expand our existing partnership with sinopec to build a second po sm plant in china joint ventures enable us to expand our reach with relatively low capital commitments in attractive markets the proposed new jv will serve growing demand for both propylene oxide and styrene in china where styrene demand is growing at a reasonable rate as demand for po based construction materials packaging and furnishings continues to grow we see an opportunity to bring together our leading technology with sinopec s operational capabilities to further serve the chinese market the chart on slide 18 depicts the company s cost leadership in producing propylene oxide from our two co product technologies we re building using our cost leading po tba technology on the us gulf coast where butane feedstocks are abundant and low priced in china we have selected our po sm technology to serve growing propylene oxide and styrene demand both of our co product technologies offer significant cost advantage over new plants based on alternative technology or aging or idling capacity on slide 19 let s review the results of our advanced polymer solutions segment fourth quarter ebitda was 54 million a 48 million decline over the third quarter of 2019 volumes and margins declined as we are seeing continued headwinds from the automotive sector and a seasonal decline in the construction market fourth quarter pre tax integration costs were 38 million compared with the prior period compounding solutions results declined approximately 35 million due to continued headwinds in the automotive market advanced polymers results decreased about 20 million due to lower margin and volume due to a seasonal decline in construction demand full year ebitda results for the segment were 424 million a 24 million improvement over 2018 2019 was the first full year of results with the addition of new product lines from the acquisition of a schulman pretax integration costs were 116 million in 2019 volumes declined in legacy lyondellbasell businesses due to decreased automotive and construction demand integration activities are on track and we have captured 130 million in forward annualized run rate synergies as of december 31 we expect higher industrial construction demand particularly for products from our advanced polymers business as we move through the first quarter toward the arrival of spring any improvements in automotive and other industrial markets should benefit our compounding solutions business now let s turn to slide 20 and discuss the performance of our refining segment fourth quarter ebitda was 22 million a 28 million improvement versus the third quarter 2019 results were driven by an improvement in margin in the fourth quarter the maya 2 1 1 industry benchmark crack spread improved to an average of 19 44 per barrel for the fourth quarter additionally we benefited from relatively strong naphtha and cokes prices operations were strong for the quarter with an average crude throughput near nameplate production rate at 267 000 barrels per day full year ebitda was 232 million lower than 2018 the refinery ran well at an average crude throughput of 263 000 barrels per day this was 32 000 barrels per day higher than prior years due to the completion of planned maintenance in 2018 for the full year refining margins were impacted by the limited availability of heavy sour crude oil in the us gulf coast as well as lower maya 2 1 1 spread which declined to 17 58 per barrel in january weak demand for diesel has driven gulf coast ulsd to brent crack spreads to five year lows while we are disappointed by the current market environment we continue to expect improvement as the carriage ban on high sulfur and marine fuels takes effect in march we are well positioned to benefit from the new regulation by serving demand for more environmentally friendly marine fuels from our refinery please turn to slide 21 as we review the results of our technology segment in 2019 our technology segment delivered a record quarter and record annual profitability with our industry leading polymer production technologies and catalysts ebitda was 138 million during the fourth quarter and was 411 million for the full year with a number of significant revenue milestones reached for our licensing business we expect lower licensing income recognition and therefore lower profitability in the first quarter following the strong fourth quarter 2019 now on slide 22 i d like to take this opportunity to reiterate our company s disciplined investment growth strategy that we shared with you during our 2019 investor day we expect the contributions from our growth investments to deliver a 1 3 billion of incremental annual ebitda by 2022 applying cash yield from ebitda of about 80 combined with our moderating capex requirement of approximately 1 1 billion we expect an increase in free cash flow of about 2 1 billion that would double our free cash flow by 2022 let me summarize the year s highlights and outlook in slide 23 in 2019 our resilient portfolio was supported by abundant low cost natural gas liquid feedstocks in north america natural hedges across our global business portfolio and licensing growth in our technology segment we have generated 5 billion to 6 billion of cash from operating activities for six consecutive years this consistent and strong cash generation contributed to growth through disciplined profit generating capital investments and provided significant shareholder returns through a growing top quartile dividend and share repurchases in 2020 we look forward to the additional capacity from our hyperzone polyethylene plant for our o p americas segment we are moving towards the completion of our po tba plant in 2021 to provide further growth for our i d segment we re seizing opportunities to drive value by expanding our diverse global business portfolio we expect to see that these joint venture investments today to reap tangible earnings growth over the years to come with that said we re now pleased to take your questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin our question and answer session one moment as we wait for our first question and our first question comes from matthew blair from tudor pickering holt your line is now open matthew blair tudor pickering holt co analyst hey good morning bob maybe you want to start off on refining one of the bright spots in the quarter could you talk about whether you were able to run high sulfur fuel oil as a feed at your houston refinery and if so what kind of volumes and what kind of ebitda uplift and if you were not was the constraint economic or was it equipment related any details on that would be great bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah good morning matthew thanks for your question on refining the hsfo we are able to run supplemental feed typically when we ve cut back on crude run rates for a variety of reasons so we can run between 20 000 and 40 000 barrels a day of additional hsfo and i would say in a typical month maybe that contributes 5 million to 9 million of additional ebitda so that gives you a sense for contribution and we did do some of that in fact in january because we had some external events that caused some downtime on one of our crude units and some internal issues so we were able to buy some hsfo the margins were pretty good so we do use that as an optimization tool operator thank you and our next question comes from stephen byrne your line is now open stephen byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes thank you what fraction of your polyethylene production is currently exported to china and what other markets will this likely shift to as china becomes more self sufficient are you able to move more of it into europe and or do you have a concern that others might do this and erode the margins in that region bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah steve good morning well first of all we ve not exported as much generally as the industry has in years past and 19 is no different we did increase exports in 19 as the year progressed but we re still well below the industry average we re probably at a run rate of around 30 of our polyethylene that s exported and of that maybe 5 of it goes to china and that could move up some next year this year in 2020 as we start up our hyperzone plant and balance our system your question about self sufficiency based on ihs data and our analysis of that data it seems that china will continue to need large amounts of imports of polyethylene and that short still is incrementally growing over the next decade now it s not growing as much as we thought maybe two three years ago but there s still a significant short in china on polyethylene operator thank you and our next question comes from kevin mccarthy from vertical research partners your line is now open kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst yes good morning bob i was wondering if you could address the impact of the phase out of single use plastics in china and also comment on your table 2 of your supplemental information suggests that high density polyethylene prices declined about 110 a ton sequentially in 4q versus 3q it seems to be a little bit more than maybe some of the consultants are indicating and so i was wondering if you could comment on that and whether or not you re seeing discounting and if so might that reverse as 2020 progresses thank you bhavesh v patel chief executive officer okay so good morning kevin on your question about single use plastics i think we ll have to see how that announcement plays out whether it s in china or europe or the us one of the challenges is there aren t really readily available substitutes for many of the applications for single use plastics so in the near term kevin i don t expect significant impact on demand over let s say the next three to five years i think post five years i think we ll have to kind of watch and see how recycling shapes up and how chemical recycling develops and the technology develops but in the near to medium term i don t expect a lot of impact especially because there aren t really obvious substitutes for those applications your question on price from q4 to q3 several factors i think first of all as i said earlier as the year progressed we exported more as an industry and frankly as a company and so that mix of domestic versus export probably had some impact and also new supply came on we saw demand actually come off because of destocking and seasonality so tons of pressure in q4 we ve already seen some of that reverse for example posted spot polyethylene prices have already come up 0 03 to 0 04 since early december based on different publications that we follow so we re already seeing some of that reverse david kinney director of investor relations kevin this is dave that table that you re referring to is actually the net transaction price from ihs it s not the contract price per se for polyethylene discount operator thank you and our next question comes from jeff zekauskas from jpmorgan your line is now open jeffrey zekauskas jpmorgan analyst thanks very much can you talk about polypropylene demand trends both in the united states and in europe either sequentially or year over year in the light of the slowing of the economy and difficulties in the auto sector bhavesh v patel chief executive officer polypropylene demand growth jeff has been similar to polyethylene demand growth it s been impacted a little bit because of the slowdown in automotive and generally in the industrial sector polypropylene has more end uses in those sectors would we still see a reasonable a reasonably good market environment in polypropylene something that we ll certainly watch as new capacity comes in in 2020 but overall we see polypropylene growth developing reasonably well operator thank you and our next question comes from arun viswanathan from rbc capital markets your line is now open arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great thanks good morning bhavesh v patel chief executive officer good morning arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst i just wanted to ask you a question on the monomer side you ve often had some profitability from the metastasis unit could you size what that s been over the last several years and what your outlook is for both ethylene and propylene monomer profitability over the next couple of years thanks bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah thanks arun it does move around quite a lot as you can imagine depending on poly sorry propylene price and the spread between propylene and ethylene generally speaking if you look at q4 and you look at all of our major product areas they really declined through the quarter and have reached kind of these trough conditions and propylene is an example of that so in q4 we had really minimal contribution from our flex unit as a result of lower propylene price so as that reverses we should see better contribution from ethylene into propylene it does it moves around quite a lot and it s something that we factor into our optimization as we think about how we deploy the ethylene we produce michael mcmurray executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah arun just to give you a sense of scale in 2019 our flex profitability was about half of what it might have been in 2018 and as bob said in the fourth quarter it was very very small operator thank you and our next question comes from duffy fischer from barclays your line is now open duffy fischer barclays analyst yeah good morning guys bhavesh v patel chief executive officer good morning duffy fischer barclays analyst just a question sort of around the refinery sort of around imo 2020 i m getting a lot of feedback that people are kind of equating that with y2k we got all bent out of shape and there s not been much change because of it it seems like you guys have a little bit different view and maybe it s just delayed so can you kind of walk through how you think imo 2020 still plays out and then within that context what does that mean structurally for the refinery within lyondell s portfolio bhavesh v patel chief executive officer okay yeah good morning duffy thanks for that question so you will recall in our prior discussions about imo what we ve said is there are two primary benefits from imo for us one is that the light heavy differential would get wider which favors our refinery and the distillate spreads would increase because of the value of this low sulfur bunker fuel so one of the two have shown some signs of improvement the light heavy differential gas improved by about 3 a barrel over the past 90 60 90 days or so compared to what we saw most of last year so we re starting to see a bit of response on that and you can see it in the numbers they re not terrific but they re getting better on the distillate side there have been a couple of factors that have actually kept distillate crack spreads down or they ve actually they ve reduced in the last 60 days one is i think we probably we all underestimated the amount of inventory of compliant fuel that was built before year end to your point there was a concern about would there be enough and i think perhaps there was more than enough and so there s a bit of overhang which will be worked through so i think i see that as a temporary situation secondly we ve had a really mild winter so distillate values have come down because there hasn t been as much demand for heating again i think a seasonal effect so to summarize in terms of imo i think that the effect will be it s somewhat delayed but we are expecting some improvement in the refinery profitability as a result of imo your question about portfolio again our focus has been very consistent run the refinery as well as possible try to optimize on the product side so that we can maximize value and we re continually focused on that and we ll see how things play out longer term thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from vincent andrews from morgan stanley your line is now open vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst thank you and good morning bob i m wondering if you could talk a little bit about the asian pe markets and maybe two things to touch on one the margins have been negative there for a while now longer than if i look back over the last 10 years usually they don t stay that negative for too long before capacity comes off and they at least go back to zero and that hasn t happened and the big thing that looks like it s happened is that naphtha prices have been very strong certainly in the fourth quarter maybe they come off a little bit year to date due to the coronavirus but what is driving the naphtha price versus a relatively flat crude oil price and why aren t we seeing asian capacity come off line given the losses bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah good morning vincent really good question i think and this is really at the crux of sort of why we think we re reaching trough conditions in polyethylene globally as you rightly mentioned margins today appear to be below cash costs so you would think there would be negative earnings on many of these units not just the highest cost but probably deep into the cost curve i ve been following this business for many years including when i lived in asia more than 10 years ago and typically when you fall below 300 it s not just a few marginal crackers but many are underwater my sense is that typically it takes perhaps a quarter or two of these sorts of conditions for there to be meaningful reduction in output or idling of capacity we re nearing that stage in my opinion and it seems to me that we should see some bounce and as i said earlier if you look at posted export prices of polyethylene from mid december to mid january they have moved somewhat so again i think these are all signs of trough conditions and there should be some bounce off of these really really unusual loans operator thank you and our next question comes from john roberts from ubs your line is now open john roberts ubs analyst thank you could you give us an update on the closing of the bora deal and is the start up still on schedule bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah good morning we re working diligently to move towards definitive agreements we expect to have those completed within the first half of this year in terms of the project start up they re making really great progress and i would expect that we ll be in the commissioning stage towards the end of this year for that project i think that s one of the one of the attractiveness to us of this project is that by the time we re in a position to infuse equity into the venture we ll be within months of start up so the timing between our investment and timing of start up is very short which derisks quite a lot of that project in our view as a partner operator thank you and our next question comes from p j juvekar from citi your line is now open p j juvekar citigroup analyst yes hi good morning bob one more question on your bora project at your analyst day you mentioned that the cost of building in china is about half of that in the us can you comment about time it takes to build in china i know crews there work 24 7 to build and so what s your expectation of timing and does that jv give you any special insight into the timing of some of these new crackers that are starting up in china thank you bhavesh v patel chief executive officer good morning p j indeed it s one of the sort of attractions to us is that first of all that project is going to produce product for the local market so we don t intend to export i think it ll give us a really good window into how the market works there as well as as you said timing and cost of construction in terms of the cost they are between half and two thirds that of gulf coast builds and also timing very similar somewhere between half and two thirds of the time that s required to build on the gulf coast so and the bora project is certainly in that range relative to the us cost and timing operator thank you and our next question comes from bob koort from goldman sachs your line is now open bob koort goldman sachs analyst thanks good morning bob bhavesh v patel chief executive officer hey good morning bob koort goldman sachs analyst slide 14 you talked about those integrated spreads by competitors i guess good thing you don t have a lot of naphtha crackers but coincides with your comment that they were refining a trough just curious how that informed or adjusts use of capital plans i mean clearly your stock is getting punished pretty substantially here you ve got a big dividend that you could reduce those payouts by maybe buying some stock back on the other hand i would imagine targets are looking quite a bit cheaper as it is so could you just maybe refresh us early on in the capital deployment at this stage of the market bhavesh v patel chief executive officer sure thanks bob first of all on capex you ll recall that at investor day we had a few things we highlighted first of all sustaining capital of about 1 billion to 1 1 billion frankly we don t plan to change that we want to make sure that our units are well maintained and are able to operate when we need them at full rates and because of our dividend coverage we don t have to do that we re in a position where we re able we have a well covered dividend without having to take those sorts of steps secondly our capex is declining because the hyperzone project is essentially complete and so that capital comes off so we have somewhere around 300 million to 400 million reduction in capex from 2019 to 2020 and then if you look further out we ll see another reduction after the po tba project starts up i think the key for us is to really be thoughtful about how we think through future projects be very disciplined as we ve shown and i see great opportunity on both sides of the equation to increase cash flow we see sources of new earnings and we see capex declining that story remains intact as we discussed in investor day operator thank you and our next question comes from hassan ahmed from olympic global your line is now open hassan ahmed olympic global analyst morning bob bhavesh v patel chief executive officer morning hassan ahmed olympic global analyst bob just wanted to follow up on you made some comments about what you think the trajectory of polyethylene pricing may be obviously keeping in mind some of the negative margin trends in asia my question is a bit more specific about the grades as we see the influx of all of this polyethylene capacity in 2020 2021 it seems to have fairly large divergences between the amount of capacity that s coming online call it in hdpe and linear low versus not that much capacity coming online in ldpe so i mean how are you thinking about that should we expect to see sort of divergent pricing patterns between the different grades bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah good question and i think first of all with linear low density sorry low density polyethylene supply being less on an absolute basis the demand growth is also lower for low density polyethylene so when i think about high density polyethylene which is the majority of what we produce we do see that the supply is coming on generally when the demand is there as well if we see periods of oversupply it s episodic as opposed to structural so my sense is that as we work our way through digesting the new supply in 2020 globally and then we ll have to see how the timing works out on the future projects even in china some of the projects have been later than they were first announced so and we re going through start up of our hyperzone plant right now and if we don t reach full capacity on the first day that we put hydrocarbon in so these things have a certain ramp up rate which generally is not reflected in ihs numbers but i m somewhat constructive that i think we re we ve reached bottom and we re bouncing off of the lows in q4 and we ll see how demand develops here david kinney director of investor relations and hassan to your point i mean the days sales of inventory are reported by acc has dropped for high density by eight days since december of 2018 to december of 2019 just shows you that the market is tightening up for high density here in north america operator thank you and our next question comes from mike sison from wells fargo your line is now open michael sison wells fargo securities analyst hey guys bob when you think about your ebitda in the fourth quarter it held up pretty well given difficult environment sort of across the board so when you think about 2020 and your portfolio can you grow ebitda on 2020 and if you can where do you think you ll see some of the potential upside bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yeah good morning mike thanks for that question indeed i think we did hold up well and in our prepared comments i mentioned that the oxyfuels business did well so first of all i think the diversity in our portfolio and that some of these products are at different points in their individual cycles that helps in delivering consistent and strong cash flow but i think through sources of earnings upside first of all start up of our new hyperzone polyethylene plant as i said we re in the process of start up right now and so we should have we hope to have production by month end so once that plant is up and running and as q2 progresses we start to produce target grade slate that should start to contribute earnings also our aps integration work the integration of a schulman continues we re doing really well run rate synergies at the end of december we re at about 130 million annualized so we re doing quite well on that and we should continue to see benefits the automotive sector has been really depressed globally and frankly that hit our legacy compounding business because it was mostly automotive any rebound in automotive is going to help that segment and in our view with all of our integration work i think we re laying the groundwork for really capitalizing on small improvements furthermore imo i talked about that earlier while we ve been disappointed that we haven t seen some response yet we do believe we will see it as q2 into q2 we should see the benefits of imo in terms of better distillate cracks and even wider light heavy differential so those are some examples of earnings upside if you will that don t really rely on polyethylene market getting better per se and also when you think about cash flow the lower capex this year should be positive as well operator thank you and our next question comes from frank mitsch from fermium research your line is now open frank mitsch fermium research analyst good morning and michael nice to meet you at least telephonically look forward to meeting you in person bhavesh v patel chief executive officer thank you frank frank mitsch fermium research analyst bob i want to come back to the sinopec possum jv or the memorandum of understanding that you signed last month you mentioned a little bit about the fact that you re going to be more exposed to styrene in china and have a better prognosis for that business over there obviously this is a business that you have not expressed a lot of positive comments in the past and i m just curious has your outlook for styrene overall changed where do you see it going is this the first move of others or was this just opportunistic with sinopec if you could expand upon that that d be great bhavesh v patel chief executive officer sure good morning frank first of all that joint venture is more about po and less about sm so it s really a driver for us to invest was propylene oxide we see a growing market there over time we have a great partner in sinopec an existing relationship that we re building upon they have great operational capability as well as capability to build plants low cost so in styrene the styrene wasn t the reason we did this we re undertaking this project but on the other hand we believe that in asia certainly there s still some growth in styrene and we can place that volume when that plant starts up so more about po less about styrene but comfortable that we can place the styrene and have considered in our economics the value of styrene operator thank you and our next question comes from david begleiter from deutsche bank your line is now open david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you good morning bob can you just discuss the prospects or your views on potential us polyethylene price increase in q1 i know ag just pick up in march and april but ethane is cheap are you seeing spot export price pick up here so what s your confidence in getting up a pe price increase in february and march thank you bhavesh v patel chief executive officer good morning david first of all as i mentioned earlier the spot price has moved up post on a posted basis right so 0 03 to 0 04 depending on which publication you read i think that says that if there s some underpinning for that increase secondly inventories as reported by hcc ihs indicate that inventories are low at the producer level anecdotally we believe that the converter level inventories are also low we should see a seasonal uptick we do every year and i don t see why this year should be any different and so some seasonal uptick should help lastly something that perhaps isn t on everyone s radar is that the turnaround season is pretty heavy this year they re much heavier than last year on crackers in the us so we could see ethylene be tighter in during the turnaround season as a result of the higher level of capacity that s out so i think all of those things point toward reasonable chances of improvements operator thank you and our next question comes from jonas oxgaard from bernstein your line is now open jonas oxgaard bernstein analyst thank you bob it sounded like you thought that naphtha prices have come back down again in q2 or so i was wondering how much of that as an industry view or how much of it is your lined out view and if it is an industry view wouldn t that suggest that the producers in asia if they all know this would just try to hold on until it crashes instead of shutting down bhavesh v patel chief executive officer hey jonas i think my comment at one of the earlier questions related to i think it was vincent who asked me about asian pe margins my comment was more that those margins should come up from from sort of below the breakeven point where they are today i don t know that necessarily that s going to come from naphtha dropping i mean it could be that pe price rises and that s why the margins improved so if i express the view on naphtha that was not intentional my view was more about the fact that asian pe naphtha spreads seem untenable based on historic data and my sense is that those margins need to expand some so that they re not cash negative for a significant part of the industry over there operator thank you and our final question comes from john mcnulty from bmo capital markets your line is now open bhavesh lodaya bmo capital markets analyst okay thanks this is bhavesh for john good morning bhavesh v patel chief executive officer good morning bhavesh lodaya bmo capital markets analyst so for your technology segment it has had a solid past couple of years you shared some color for the first quarter how should we think about the cadence and size of earnings of the full year and if you could just help with some of the underlying drivers for the growth you re seeing in catalyst sales is it more about just grabbing higher market share or is it just linked to growing the growing industry capacity bhavesh v patel chief executive officer yes bhavesh first of all in our technology segment there are two components there s catalyst and then there s licensing so the catalyst business is very steady and as we do these licenses our catalyst business steadily grows that part isn t very volatile and there s definitely an upward slope in terms of earnings and one that accrues for many years to come on the licensing side it s much more variable it depends on timing of payments and i mean licenses we win your point is correct in that we ve been participating in many of these projects that you that are announced in china primarily but likely the licensing side of the business will cool off some in 2020 we do expect some lower earnings from that segment on the other hand as the license plants start up our catalyst earnings should steadily increase over time and that s really a great part of that technology businesses is that it provides stability of cash flow david kinney director of investor relations all right so i think that was the last question that we had so let me offer a few closing remarks before we sign off so our company s proven and continuous focus on operational excellence cost management and disciplined capital allocation i think will serve us really well in this current challenging environment we anticipate typical seasonal improvements for our businesses as we progress through the year favorable resolution of trade policies and a rebound in industrial demand could potentially provide significant upside for many of our businesses as i ve mentioned several times in the q a imo 2020 is expected to increase earnings in our refinery we see increasing polyethylene volumes from our new hyperzone investment and i think generally we re really well poised as a company to deliver and continue our outstanding track record of cash generation in this year to come so we thank you for your interest in our company and look forward to updating you in april at the end of the first quarter thank you and with that have a great weekend we are adjourned operator duration 63 minutes call participants david kinney director of investor relations bhavesh v patel chief

regular readers know i often criticize so called experts usually economists or central bankers whose flawed decisions are punishing the rest of us i find their expertise is not nearly as reliable as they seem to think at the same time i rely on experts whose judgment i respect i know they aren t perfect usually because they know and disclose their own limitations and limitations of the data they rely on i take ideas from many sources load them in my mental blender and produce what is hopefully a smooth tasty concoction you read in my letters the interesting part one that often slips my mind is that sharing these ideas makes many readers consider me an economic expert then they hold me responsible for whatever i said just as i do with central bankers they re absolutely right we who have large audiences should be accountable for everything we say in my case that s not in a legal sense because these letters aren t investment advice per se but i still owe readers my best efforts and sorry if this shocks anyone i sometimes get it wrong as you will see today sometimes i get it really badly completely wrong thankfully not too often that opens an interesting question can an expert be both incorrect and valuable are we sometimes better off with them than without them i think so and recently someone proved it even as they highlighted my own mistakes earlier this month you read my forecasts for both 2020 and the 2020s see part 1 part 2 in the course of which i re examined my 2019 outlook i put a lot of work into those letters so much so that i completely forgot about the five year forecast i had published five years ago i should have reviewed it too incidentally if you ever want to know what i thought at some point in the past my complete archive back to 2001 is on our website visit this page and see the right sidebar some of it i wish would disappear and i like to think my writing has improved over time but keeping it online is part of my self accountability but back to that january 2015 five year forecast financial advisor larry swedroe recently eviscerated it at the advisor perspectives site a little research revealed he s written many variations of this same article over the years larry believes all forecasts are useless and all forecasters are incompetent it must be nice to know your conclusion before you start writing i m a bit envious that said i gave larry plenty to criticize several of my expected events didn t happen in the next five years my main failure was thinking the japanese yen would collapse i didn t anticipate the bank of japan could get away with injecting the vast amounts of stimulus they did let s backtrack this was the timeframe i was suggesting when i wrote japan is a bug in search of a windshield i said correctly the boj would have to monetize significant amounts of japanese government debt which was close to 250 of gdp at the time their bond market was stretched to the limit and monetize they did with a vengeance i looked at the more limited quantitative easing we did in the us and which was still going on in europe while our qe exploded asset prices it didn t seem to affect the dollar all that much however i expected the bank of japan would have to do 6x 8x more relatively speaking than the us or europe had i could find no example in history where such massive intervention by the central bank hadn t devalued the currency now we know what happened let s just say i didn t get the same results george soros and stan druckenmiller had betting against the pound decades earlier sigh corollary to the yen prediction the us dollar didn t strengthen like i thought it would this let china and other emerging markets avoid hard landing scenarios which might have triggered a us recession and bear market too the sequence of events was plausible at the time and i still think something much like it would have happened had i been right about the yen but i wasn t and that error led to the others when you have a bunch of dominoes lined up and the first one doesn t fall the others will probably stay upright too but they will fall eventually like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here first name this is required email this is required subscribe for free recaptcha right now the federal reserve is injecting billions into the repo market which is in turmoil because bond markets are beginning to choke on our huge and growing treasury debt issuance they said last year this effort would end in march my 2020 forecast was that the fed would continue the program past march this week they extended it to april i believe we will see yet another extension or they will quickly resume after a short hiatus as the market has become addicted to stimulus the wall street journal reported last week the fed is considering a plan to cap long term treasury rates by purchasing unlimited amounts of t bonds you may recognize that as essentially what the bank of japan has been doing we really are turning japanese turning japanese i really think so with apology to the vapors larry swedroe uses my mistake and those of others to argue that forecasting is futile and no one should pay attention to people like me who do it much better he thinks to passively allocate your money to index funds and hope for the best his firm will gladly help you do so too for a fee i m not against buy and hold indexing it deserves a place in some portfolios my main problem with it is that very few people can hold on through the kind of drawdowns that happen every few years they ll say they can handle it and sincerely mean it you can give them suitability questionnaires personality profiles and any other kind of test you can promise to hold their hand through tough times but when half their life savings disappears within what seems like a matter of weeks and they were counting on that money to reach their dreams almost everyone gives up they typically will regret it later because they probably sold near the bottom but their reaction was natural and predictable i don t see the value of setting up yourself or your clients for that outcome this isn t just conjecture we have 25 years of dalbar s qaib quantitative analysis of investor behavior studies dalbar looks at mutual fund inflows and outflows to measure actual investor results given when they bought and sold they have consistently found the average investor s return sharply lags those long term returns the funds advertise in 2018 when the s p 500 retreated 4 4 the average investor lost more than twice as much 9 4 this is greed and fear at work buy and hold strategies presume you can remove greed and fear from the equation that is possibly true for a few highly educated disciplined people not most or anything close to most investors are human they have emotions those emotions aren t going anywhere nor do we want them to because they are important to other parts of life active strategies don t necessarily have better results for the last 10 years passive investing has clearly outperformed active management which is why we see investors piling into passive funds passive managers actually disprove their own theory they assume markets will behave certain ways based on patterns and correlations they can t know will continue if forecasting is pointless then looking at the past and extrapolating it into the future is also pointless and indeed those presumed correlations have sometimes fallen apart under stress we saw it in the 1990s with long term capital management and again in the 2008 2009 financial crisis asset classes that were supposed to zig when everything else zagged decided they would zag as well thank you let s also note many of the indexes on which index funds are based are hardly passive committees decide which stocks to include and which weighting methodology to follow so not only is passive investing impractical it s often not even passive for example in 1965 the average tenure of companies on the s p 500 was 33 years by 1990 it was 20 years it s forecast to shrink to 14 years by 2026 about 50 percent of the s p 500 will be replaced over the next 10 years if innosight s forecasted churn rate holds so what they call passive is really active management by expert committees clearly the stock market is hard to predict from year to year that s why larry argues that predictions are pointless and that you should buy and hold that s been really good advice for the last 11 years passive kicked derrière over active management during that time when larry argues for passive buy and hold strategies he is talking his book passive is what he does for a fee i do the same in private or behind regulated websites every money manager does it s part of our dna nothing wrong with that let s look more closely at the book larry preaches from unless otherwise indicated the charts below are from my friend ed easterling of crestmont research who was just named the benton county oregon s timber farmer of the year i have been there and it is a truly fabulous place with 150 foot tall douglas firs he also runs cattle for monthly income a far cry from his big hedge fund days but ed still offers some of the best data and analysis this first chart is about the ups and downs for the last 20 years from the s p 500 ending in 2019 just for grins and giggles here s a chart going all the way back to 1928 a tad more volatile source macrotrends like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here first name this is required email this is required subscribe for free recaptcha the next chart shows the past 20 years which despite good periods trended toward lower long term returns that is because the past 20 years reflect contrasting decades a poor start followed by great post recession returns as we see in the next chart your buy and hold return for the first 10 years was negative even before inflation and management fees in real terms with fees knock off another 2 3 that was an ugly decade but since the great recession it s been nothing but rainbows and ponies why such a contrast because starting valuations drive long term returns something ed and i have jointly written about at least a dozen times from currently elevated levels with p e at historic highs second only to 2000 the next decade will probably be more like the 2000s than the 2010s or at least that s what 100 years of stock market history suggests here are some relevant questions for those who believe buy and hold is all you need buy and hold worked for the last 10 years do your clients have 10 years from now we just ended the first decade in us history without a recession and thus no significant bear market do you think that is likely to continue through the 2020s what if we have two recessions in the 2020s are you prepared to hold through a decade of zero or negative returns we are now clearly in the top 10 of historical p e valuations when 10 year long term returns historically have been the lowest on record on an inflation adjusted basis you can actually have negative returns for 20 years it took 26 years to get back to breakeven from the bear market that began in 1966 we don t know the future i get that but i also know that every time somebody like greenspan or bernanke says we are in a new era it turns out not to be the case p e ratios matter have you shown your clients what happens at the beginning of bull and bear markets in terms of p e ratios are you telling them lower returns over the next 10 years is a real possibility based on history just asking another irony is that swedroe published his article on advisor perspectives a site that frequently promotes exactly the kind of forecasts including mine swedroe says are useless i m not sure why he would want to be in that company even stranger swedroe doesn t just argue forecasting is futile he questions the value of expertise generally he cites the example of a physician stating he knows exactly what is wrong and what to do that s probably not a good sign but it s also a straw man i ve been to many doctors in my life they examine diagnose and treat as well as they can based on what they know limited though it may be i am still alive and knock on wood healthy for my age that might not be the case if doctors said i can t be sure what is wrong and anything i do might make you worse just go home to bed i want their expertise and i m better for it no economic forecaster i have ever seen save a few obvious crackpots claims certainty we try to offer insight that helps investors understand what they are doing and why we try to point out the extraordinary difficulty in predicting the future i said this in the opening to my 2019 forecast letter we re all blasted with too much information and it s easy to get overwhelmed i find that having a framework helps organize my thoughts of course you have to be flexible and modify the framework when it no longer fits if the facts change etc but that s better than floating aimlessly at least to me i wasn t thinking of it at the time but floating aimlessly is a good way to describe passive investing you can t aim if you have no target or have no idea where the target is you just float and hope you find it before something bad happens to you in the real world my managed portfolios are fairly bullish as they should be but they are diversified and hedged and in some cases can go to cash we certainly can t pick market tops and bottoms but we can avoid the worst of bear markets and enjoy the power of bull markets accredited investors who have more options thanks to the us government s protection of small investors there are opportunities to enjoy market like returns with significantly less volatility yes that is me talking my book so let me make a 10 year forecast that may come back and bite me i think we see a recession in the early part of the 2020s and i expect an extraordinarily volatile end of the decade where another great recession is quite possible if so total returns will look more like the 2000s rather than the 2010s for buy and hold investors bull markets simply don t begin at valuation levels like we have today that doesn t mean you shouldn t be invested there are lots of opportunities besides us and world stock markets but i think the mad rush we ve seen into passive investing will turn out very badly boomers who are near or in retirement should be very conservative and investing in buy and hold large cap stocks at today s valuations is the opposite of conservative it is simply bad advice to suggest they do so retirement savings should focus on income and capital preservation in my best dirty harry imitation a final question for buy and hold advocates do you feel lucky you think the 2020s will look like the 2010s are you sure we won t have another decade like the 2000s are you really prepared for a 20 year cycle are your clients hope is generally a bad strategy people often say i am bearish or a perma bear that is so not true i am cautiously optimistic 2019 was a stellar year 2018 not so much i have no idea what this year will bring so i look for strategies that offer opportunity no matter what happens cautious optimism rules i am bullish on humanity and worried about governments and central banks i see opportunities everywhere but they are rifle shots like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our

chd earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 church dwight co inc chd 0 02 q4 2019 earnings call 1 00 p m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer thank you all for coming today and thanks to everyone who is dialing in from officer or home i m going to begin with the safe harbor statement i recommend that everybody read that at your leisure i ll tell you who is with us today from management we have our cmo britta bomhard our head of international and global new products steve cugine for general counsel if you have any legal questions rick dierker our cfo rick spann who runs supply chain and paul wood would who runs the us sales all right so here is i m going to give you the short story right now so you don t have to really pay attention to the other 150 slides we had a terrific year this is the second consecutive year that our company grew organic sales 4 the us posted 4 organic sales growth and 10 out of 12 of our power brands grew or held share the international posted 9 2 organic growth and continues to be a juggernaut for the company and as we ended the year organic growth returned to the specialty products business after two down years last time we had an up quarter was q4 2017 and the reason it turned positive is because the dairy market became healthy and another encouraging sign is that domestic volumes turned positive in the fourth quarter and finally we had record cash from operations in 2019 so now looking ahead to 2020 we re calling 3 5 organic growth and that is net of exiting the low margin gummy private label business and consistent with our evergreen model we re calling 7 to 9 eps growth and that is top tier in cpg i want to recap for a minute why church dwight is a standout in the consumer space number one we have an evergreen model that our shareholders are very familiar with as our employees number 2 we focus on cash number 3 we have an ability to execute and that s what drives our performance we deliver meaningful topline and bottom line growth year after year we have a very lean company with the highest sales per employee of any of our peers and net sales per employee stat is an underappreciated metric we are innovators with new product offerings across many categories year after year and we are becoming digitally savvy 8 of our sales are online today and that does not include buy online pickup in store if we included that it would be much higher than 8 we make good choices when it comes to acquisitions those choices have led us to dry shampoo gummy vitamins women s hair removal water flossers and hair thinning solutions so we believe there is no better place to invest in cpg than church dwight so here s our track record let s go to the next slide there we are so looking over the last three five and 10 years we ve delivered double digit tsr returns to our shareholders and if you look at 2019 8 3 and that s on top of a 2018 that was plus 30 so let s move on to the formal part of the program so who we are why we re winning britta is going to come up and talk about them give you an update for the master brand and also britta and i are going to ham and egg the consistent innovation story steve is going to come up and talk about international i m going to come back and tell you about animal productivity and how we run the company and then we re going to end with rick on financials all right first who we are so i talked about our evergreen business model this is in grain not only in the hearts of our employees but all of our long term shareholders as well 3 topline 8 bottom line and if you say well how s that going for you and you look at what the last 10 years the average organic sales growth has been 3 6 so where is that 3 coming from well it s coming 2 from the us 6 international and 5 specialty products we don t always hit these in the market any one year but that is the long term algorithm if you say what are your brands we have lots and lots of brands but we have 12 power brands and those 12 power brands account for 80 of our revenues and profits and we have a very well balanced portfolio little bit more than half is or if you look at the consumer products part of the house personal care 49 household 44 you can see specialty products at 7 now it s a diversified portfolio in that 63 is premium and 37 is value that means we perform well in virtually any economy and we have a lot of runway for international so international has been a juggernaut as i ve said for the last five years still only 17 of the company so we ve got a long way to go there and we do operate in the lands of the giants you could see we have 4 4 billion in sales all of our competitors are significantly larger than we are we think this gives us an advantage so we work fast we re nimble when you have only 4 800 employees you can make quick decisions you can move faster communication is easier and you can adapt to change better and we have a long history of acquisitions we ve added almost 3 billion in sales since 2004 over the last 15 years and a lot of that came from acquisitions and we have very specific acquisition criteria we re only going to look for a brand that has number 1 or number 2 share high growth high margin needs to be asset light we need to be able to leverage our supply chain footprint and we must have a sustainable competitive advantage and since the year 2000 so over the last 19 years 20 years we ve acquired 11 out of our 12 power brands in the year 2000 the only big brand we had was arm hammer so what we say around the house is 12 brands today 20 tomorrow now why are we winning five reasons one we re in the right categories two we know how to grow shares three we don t have a high exposure to private label we re growing online and we are on trend so let s look at the categories so if you look at the categories over the last four years in general our categories weighted average grew 3 so this is the underpinning for the company s long term organic growth of 3 and as far as growing share this is our report card you don t get this report card for many cpg companies but every year we tell you how we re doing so for our 12 major brands we maintain our growth share and you can see this year for the first time 10 out of 12 were green and we get lots of questions generally about the laundry category so what s the long term trend in laundry so over the last three years we ve added 120 basis points of share in laundry the other winner was procter gamble and the henkel has struggled now you know as we go from quarter to quarter we get lots of questions on non measured channels let me give you a sense for how big our non measured channels for some of our categories most of these categories are going to be 70 80 90 represented on nielsen but if you go to the far right you see some of our more recent categories power flossing hair thinning and even electric women s electric grooming are all significantly less than 50 so it s something to bear in mind going forward we have low exposure to private label the weighted average share of private label for our categories is only 12 only five of our categories have private label exposure and as you can see from the lines on that chart you can see it s relatively stable and we re growing online back in 2015 we were fourth quartile when it came to online sales today we re first quartile we hit our goal of 8 in 2019 and we have a goal to be over 9 in 2020 and we have lots of number 1 products on amazon and amazon of course is the number 1 online retailer okay on trend so going to roll through four of our brands and why we think we re on trend take batiste it s a business we acquired in 2011 so dry shampoo was a convenient solution to women between wet shampoos this was a business with 20 million in sales in 2011 if you look at what kind of runway do you have in the us well in the us 125 million women there are 125 million women over the age of 18 two thirds of them don t wash their hair every day and 13 of them today use dry shampoo now if you look at household penetration it s only 7 5 in the us so now if you want to try to figure out well how big could it be in the us we look at the uk the uk is the most mature dry shampoo market it s where it originated so if we compare where the us is the us is in the middle innings and we can see by in comparison to where the uk is that the dry shampoo market will double from 225 million at retail to 450 million over time so being the number 1 dry shampoo because we have a lot of runway ahead of us next up is women s electric hair removal we bought the number 1 women s electric hair remover in flawless so these are tools to remove if i go left to right face brow leg and whole body so women are looking for convenient ways to remove hair and if you look at the household penetration it s only 2 in the us and less than 2 in rest of the world so a lot of runway here for this business next up is water flossers we have the number 1 power flosser and recommended by the ada so what s the story there and we can do a show hands everybody knows 80 of people don t floss every day even though they should and consumers are discovering water flossers water flossers are the easiest solution to flossing again look at household penetration 22 in the us not bad but we think that could go as high as 48 if you just look at the penetration for electric toothbrushes and then if you look at the in europe for example it s only 3 to 5 so we re just getting started with water flossers outside the us again on trend got lots of runway ahead of us next up is gummy vitamins you know the story pretty well the gummy form is more appealing than pills and capsules and if you go back to when we bought the business the adult gummy form was 3 of the category now it s 18 and if you look at the size of the category it just continues to grow it grew from 15 16 17 from 800 million to 1 5 billion today lots of runway and then finally is hair thinning solutions we have the number 1 hair fiber and the number 1 hair thinning supplement and we all know it s on people s mind 40 of men and women have noticeable hair loss by the age of 40 so we ve great solutions to that okay now i m going to bring up britta to talk about the master brand britta bomhard executive vice president chief marketing officer hello everyone everybody awake so you might remember arm hammer is by far our biggest brand it is more than a million billion sorry dollar brand it s really important to us and you might remember from last year we presented our more power to you campaign year in this iconic institution now i know most of you are pretty skeptical you re a little bit like my boss is this really working so i thought why don t i share a couple of results first since we launched the campaign in 12 months we ve actually added 2 6 million households who are now buying arm hammer and that s an increase of 3 and this picture you are seeing here is actually it is currently nearly seven out of 10 households buying arm hammer and if this room is representative my ambition is actually to have three out of four households buying arm hammer so you might remember there is not many where the us is as united as having three out of four people agree that this is a great choice but what s more important you could now say well but you get them in via promotions no actually we have people spend more money on arm hammer and you see here they are spending 5 more so if you think about it what is a great sign for brand health more people buying it and spending more so i think that s a very clear answer that arm hammer is very healthy and growing wonderfully right there we go and i think for those of you who it saw last year you might want to note that we have arm hammer in every single one of our brands and categories and i want to show you couple of how we communicate about arm hammer and for those of you who have seen some of our cats they ve just got cuter so have a look at the cat that s a really distinctive campaign and is working really well for us you might not have seen this campaign because we just recently launched our arm hammer dental campaign at the very end of last year it s a very hard one to breakthrough so i hope a you appreciate how different it is to normal dental commercial you might see and secondly it also illustrates that this campaign works in no matter what category so let s look at that one challenged and checked how well the plaque removal is currently on what you use and moving on to our next you might know if you re not part of the burning man crowd and i m pretty sure most of us here in this room aren t then this one is what we say is a great deodorant is a broad spectrum of what we can do with the arm hammer campaign on every single of those different categories playing to what s important and what s the consumer insight but still bringing it altogether and driving the overall 1 billion brand so i think that s pretty unique but i m actually here to talk about something new which it s not too much of a reveal as it s standing or sitting on all your tables but our new clean and simple laundry detergent it s clean it s simple it s smart and it s powerful so what have we learned about consumers and you might have seen that in a few other areas in food the transparency in less is more in ingredients has already been quite established and this trend is now moving from what people ingested to what s on me and then two what s around me and this is where we have an amazing detergent which has a no compromise powerful clean laundry with a simple ingredient list so none of the others offer that and what s even better of it and it s a pity that my colleague carlos who heads up our r d is not here today but he and his team are really revolutionizing of how we look at making innovation one of part is there is a very different innovation culture we are connecting the different teams around r d in the different areas of expertise a lot more risk taken and obviously speed and that s what you can see here how we came up and looking at what s happening in the food industry it s a very clear trend which will come into the other areas and that s where our future works team actually discovered the clean and simple formulation so what s in there or better what s not in there because that s what consumers are asking so it doesn t have dies no added preservatives no phosphates no brighteners and no parabens sounds pretty attractive doesn t it but what s in there is six essential ingredients a hardworking cleaner active stain remover laundry booster baking soda of course water softener and fragrance and what s more and important it has few ingredients but it is as powerful as our best selling product which is arm hammer with oxiclean and as we said it has fewer ingredients not only as our own but the typical average laundry detergent has between 15 and 30 ingredients so we only have six and here less is more but not only that it s also very good for the environment so on the next iteration of laundry bottles you will actually see this back label which will talk about our partnership with the arbor day foundation where we helped planting trees for cleaner air and water this product has also been elected as a safer choice so we have that endorsement which is very important to reassure consumers and we are also using the green e which says it s with a 100 certified renewable electricity and of course we are one of the leading partners of howtorecycle which is in a lot of our labels and also graces this label as the bottle is fully recyclable and now you wonder how will we tell consumers about it so let s have a look hope you noticed we are helping women making the right choices and we have very positive feedback because it s such a good way to get it from a trusted brand like arm hammer and once we drive people to store this is what they will see in the future we have massive executions in stores and coming soon dollar general so what else do consumers want besides clean and simple there s other trends which are about sustainability and convenience and matt talked about online shopping lots and lots of people actually order online that s not as developed in the laundry area because it s difficult to shop big bottles so we have a solution for consumers who want convenience and sustainability because we have launched arm hammer plus oxiclean our best seller as a super concentrated laundry detergent it has 3 times more cleaning power but it has 37 less plastic and uses 30 less water so again fully on a sustainability trend and available to consumers who prefer shopping on e commerce i ve talked a lot about arm hammer we also have another exciting brand oxiclean and if i look around the room except for everybody who is on my team today you know that black clothes dark clothes are very important and about 42 of all wash loads get sorted into black dark colors and we have a solution for that so oxiclean dark protect which was specifically formulated for dark and black fabrics so as we are now in winter season take a note you might want to get one of those and with that i hand it over to matt who s going to share insights on hair care matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer all right obviously i m the expert on dry shampoo so if you re somebody with normal hair and you pick up an aerosol can of dry shampoo that s ok that might make my hair dryer so we said hey what s going to appeal to women with normal to dry hair so we said ok we re going to launch batiste waterless cleansing foam so this is something that you rub into your hair and refreshes your hair and dries in 60 seconds and we have four different variants that we re launching right now and now waterpik you also often hear us talk about waterpik water flosses for waterpik that business we re experts in water jet technology so that technology has been around for almost 50 years and so now we re coming out with a brand new the first known fda registered showerhead the insight here is that millions of americans discuss massage with their doctors it s something that waterpik folks started to look into so here it is water for wellness this fda registered power pulse showerhead and we ve done nine clinical studies and what those studies tell us is that these particular showerheads soothe muscles they increase flexibility and they promote better sleep and here is kind of a fun fact the average shower is eight to 12 minutes and what our consumers tell us is that these benefits they start feeling after two minutes using these showerheads really cool innovation okay as i talked about flawless earlier women are focused on convenient hair removal so new product from flawless is called nu razor this is waterless whole body hair removal anywhere anytime now flawless we ve got a lot of interest in flawless on the part of analysts and shareholders so have to give a little bit of an update on that one major retailer right now the reset has already happened from as seen on tv through the wet shave aisle and that s happening in a lot of retailers why is that important it s because the traffic in the wet shave aisle is 4 times the traffic in as seen on tv so this is launching right now with one major retailer and after two weeks the pos consumption is up 7 and that s just one major retailer we know what kind of wins we have for 2020 and our total distribution point is going to be up 15 in 2020 and recall if you read in the press release that we expect the flawless sales to be up 15 and this is part of the underpinning for that that as well as the nu razor launch we think we re going to be in a good shape for the coming year all right next up is natural toothpaste are growing 14 times the rate of the toothpaste category so we re introducing arm hammer essentials toothpaste two different variants and we ve gotten really really good reception from retailers particularly the drug class of trade next up men it s trojan condoms wait for it men want to ensure their partner is satisfied so we ve got a new product called g spot from trojan and we have an ad for you take a look we always have a little fun with that trojan brand by the way whenever we have a meeting for new products it s the for trojan it s the most well attended meeting in the company if you look people sitting on the window sills all right vms so vitamin we have lots of line extensions coming in 2020 and we re addressing a lot more need states and we ve really picked up the pace of innovation for vitamins if you look at 17 and 18 we kind of averaged six new items a year we had 22 new items in 2019 we got 17 more coming in 2020 too many to run through through today and we have more innovation coming in 2020 in other categories so stay tuned you will hear about those later in the year and next up is steve to tell you our fabulous international story come on up steve steven p cugine executive vice president international and gnpi thank you matt excellent so i m pleased to be here to share with you the fabulous international growth story so as matt already talked about the evergreen target for international is 6 per year in 2014 we delivered 535 million in sales we finished 2019 at 756 million in sales the important note here is that we firmly believe that we reached global scale there isn t a market that we re not in today and where we can t reach with our ourselves or through our existing subsidiary markets or through our gmg business i think even more impressive than the size of the business is that we ve tripled the organic growth rate from roughly 3 to about 9 so significantly larger business tripling the growth rate this is an important chart that we show every year but there is some new information here our global markets group is now 33 of the total business for the first time it is the largest segment within the international business followed by canada europe three countries mexico and australia we have grown historically well above our evergreen target of 6 in 2019 we hit 9 2 an outstanding year and we leave the year with momentum delivering 10 6 so we feel the wind at our back let s break that down in a little more detail our subsidiary markets delivered 5 2 and our gmg business a whopping 19 2 our subsidiaries are largely in developed markets so 5 2 in developed markets is really outstanding performance our brands are healthy whether they be in emerging markets through gmg or in our subsidiary markets so we re excited about the performance of both of these businesses the gmg business is certainly an engine of growth for the division and for the company since 2014 when we initiated the start of our new growth strategy for international this business has delivered 19 cagr throughout its life cycle and again 19 we did 19 2 lot of 19s in there and it s driven by our core brands so we re driving arm hammer batiste waterpik vms oxiclean sterimar femfresh and now flawless we continue to invest in building capabilities around the world as you know year in and year out i ve been up here talking about the investments that we ve made in southeast asia and then talked about china we continue to make incremental investments in china southeast asia germany fast growing market for us in europe and in central america we ve taken the opportunity to localize the content that we give to consumers because these brands need to show up differently market by market so they are relevant we are investing particularly last year and this year in technology because matt talked about speed of decision making we feel is a differentiator for the company that is also true in these very dynamic international markets we invest a lot in our gmg distributor training and regulatory affairs we want to make sure that our partners in particular markets know as much as we do we provide them innovation case studies they share case studies so they are an extension of our family and we think that is unique to church dwight so we are absolutely committed to 6 organic growth moving forward we believe we have a runway for our existing brands we have demonstrated our ability to grow acquired brands waterpik now flawless our gmg group will continue to post double digit growth and we ve made investments in fast growing markets that we think we can leverage because we feel that we have a scaled global business for the first time we re going to make a new commitment and that commitment is not only organic growth but we re going to continue to expand operating margin year in and year out we re going to take a big step change from from 2019 to 2020 and part of our evergreen target is to deliver another 50 bps of growth of operating margin expansion and that is on top of any incremental investments that we re going to make to ensure that we have the capabilities around the world so in summary one we have the right strategies for growth we ve demonstrated that we know that two we have brands that consumers love around the world three we ve built a management team that is outstanding and several of them around the world are here today so to them i say thank you and we feel that we are just starting but there is a lot of runway in international markets for church dwight s products matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay animal productivity so back to the 3 algorithm 2 us 6 international and 5 for specialty products where is the 5 going to come from well we have a bulk chemicals business which is bulk sodium bicarbonate and then animal productivity 6 how is it been working out for you not very well so let s talk about why is that so just going to go slow on this when you look at the top of the chart that s specialty products division organic sales growth since 2011 so what do you notice you re up in 2011 down in 12 and 13 up in 14 22 6 down in 15 and 16 up in 17 down 18 and 19 back up in 20 and then below it you say ok what was going on milk prices and you can see as milk prices recover that s when you see a green for the growth of the specialty products business so we knew that a few years ago in 2015 we said hey we got to start moving into other species and in 2015 99 of the animal productivity business was dairy and today that s not true it was 1 nondairy today it 27 nondairy so we think that we re going to be able to flatten this out over time now why don t we go into other species well because of the demand for protein and it s simply population growth we had 7 7 billion people today going to 9 8 billion by the middle of the century and antibiotics are out of favor and the consumers are telling retailers and farmers hey no antibiotics no hormones no chemicals and if you look at the stats you see that there is a 40 decrease in the use of animal probiotics since 2015 so that bodes well for us because we bought two businesses one was called vicor the other was agro biosciences they get us into prebiotics and custom probiotics we were in nutritional supplements for dairy we then got into prebiotics and probiotics so now we have a nice portfolio for not only dairy but cattle swine and poultry as i said before the non dairy business is 27 of animal productivity today we think that s going to have big growth in 2020 and we do get lots of questions about milk hey people raise their hands isn t milk consumption in the united states on decline absolutely so if you look at this chart here the per capita consumption in 2015 was 174 pounds it s annually more recently it s 164 pounds but if you look what s going on with cheese there s a big offset to that it takes 10 pounds of milk to make one pound of cheese i know when you come to the church dwight conferences you always walk away learning something you didn t know so when you think about milk also think cheese cheese is a big offset for the decline in milk production so the dairy industry does have growth ahead of it so we do feel good long term about our algorithm of 5 we have the trusted brand the arm hammer brand goes across prebiotics probiotics all of our products we are aligned with the consumer trend we re now into multiple species and all the growth is ahead of us particularly internationally now i want to talk about how we run the company there s five operating principles one we leverage brands we have 12 brands that account for 80 of our revenues and profits these are brands that consumers love second thing we ve long been a friend of the environment and i m going to go into that a little bit deeper in a moment and we leverage people we have highly productive people an environment where people do matter and finally we re asset light we leverage our assets and if you do those four things well you re going to have really good returns but because one of our competencies is identifying acquiring and integrating businesses we turn our good returns into great returns as i said here are the brands we have brands consumers love as far as a friend of the environment goes over 100 years ago we started using recycled paperboard in our cartons in the 1970s we were the first and we were the only corporate sponsor of the first earth day actually 20 years later in 1990 we re still the only corporate sponsor of earth day and we were the first to take phosphates out of laundry detergent more recently we ve been more focused on green global electricity demand supply by renewable sources both wind and power and we ve been planting lots of trees with arbor day and we all remember from fifth grade science that trees take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and they turn it into oxygen what are some of our goals we want to reduce water and wastewater by 25 by 2022 we want to recycle more we want it 75 by the end of this year and finally we want to be carbon neutral so 100 carbon neutral by 2025 and that s through having green electricity and also planting millions and millions of trees but that s our goal today we re at 60 carbon neutral what that means is we offset 60 of the co2 that we put into the atmosphere okay and we ve been getting some recognition for that as well we regularly show up on the list of barron s forbes the epa list of companies that are faithful to the environment all right now i also mentioned highly productive people in a place where people matter this is a statistic that is interesting this revenue per employee so you can see we re on the far right we re over 900 000 right now on our way to 1 million per employee and you can see where our peers are we think this is very representative of how lean the company is and the thing that most people can t tell about any company you invest in is what is the culture and the culture in our company is as follows and we talk about this both inside and outside the company it s blue collar high aptitude underdogs we re digitally savvy we embrace diversity and we like taking risks and because that is the environment within our company and you can t just snap your fingers flip a light switch and create that i didn t create that that s been there for many many years it s the greatest asset of the company and i think that s one of the reasons why we re so successful year after year after year now we have tremendous financial literacy within the company most companies will focus on revenue and eps we also focus on gross margin and that s 25 of everyone s annual bonus and when it s in your bonus you ask questions like hey what s gross margin and how can we get it because it affects me so how we get it is we have a good to great program that s our continuous improvement program we are continually optimizing our plans new products are launched with higher gross margins than the products they replace and when we buy businesses we make them better we expand the gross margins of the businesses that we acquire we have very simple compensation structure you can see on the left side of the pie net revenue and eps on the right side we focus on gross margin which is uncommon as the metric within incentive compensation program and cash from operations we ve long described ourselves as free cash flow junkies and we still are all right i m going to bring up rick to talk about financials now rick dierker executive vice president chief financial officer all right thanks matt good afternoon so i m going to go through three things we re going to go through the 2019 results for the quarter for the full year and then go through the outlook and before we do that we ll just start with evergreen model because we always do 3 topline growth and 8 eps growth and then the drill down for that is 3 organic net sales growth 25 basis points of gross margin expansion flat on marketing as a percent higher dollars typically with revenue growth we leverage sg a and we get to 50 basis points of operating margin expansion and an 8 eps growth so that s the backdrop so how did we do in q4 you heard from matt already you saw in the release this morning 4 4 organic revenue growth domestic was 3 5 international was 10 5 and spd for the first time in eight quarters with positive organic growth which is great adjusted gross margin was 170 basis points up i ll walk through the detail of that in a minute marketing was up 240 basis points so that s the highest spend rate we ve had in 2019 just 37 million more year over year it s a very significant increase sg a was up largely because of the acquisition our tsa agreement as well as the amortization with that deal adjusted eps was 0 55 versus the 0 54 outlook so on a revenue basis the quarter was very strong 4 4 and it was very strong even versus a strong year ago 4 3 so on a stacked basis 8 7 if you run your eyes across the page 4 5 in the first quarter 4 9 in the second 3 5 4 4 and then 4 4 for the year so for the full year like i said 4 4 domestic has a 4 in front of it that s fantastic as britta said 10 of 12 power brands grew share during the year internationally just heard from steve 9 is a great number and then spd was minus 3 gross margin was up 110 basis points i ll go through the detail gross margin in other slide marketing was up 10 basis points that s greater than our outlook and then adjusted sg a was also up for the same reasons i talked about in the quarter eps was up 9 to 2 47 and cash from operations was up to 865 million up 16 year over year just a fantastic result higher cash earnings and improved working capital which leads to free cash flow conversion of 128 which is industry leading and we have a slide on that so gross margin just to walk you through the puts and takes in q4 plus 60 basis points so that s really the we continue to get the benefit from price as well as higher volumes inflation is a 50 basis point drag for the quarter that has moderated a little bit since earlier in the year productivity programs are up 110 basis points it s been pretty consistent for the whole year and then acquisition so there s two parts of the acquisition 50 basis points from owning flawless 10 basis points is because they have a slightly higher gross margin in the company the other 40 basis points is acquisition accounting remember we took that the revenue minus cogs minus marketing marketing profit that s one line in net sales from the period of may through october and so when there is no offset it s a pure margin so gross margin expansion on a reported basis is 170 basis point and then on a comparable basis it would be 130 basis points so that s the quarter and for the full year many of the same things apply and comparable gross margin expansion is plus 70 basis points so just a fantastic year we raised gross margin i think 3 times throughout the year so on to 2020 so 6 5 reported sales growth that s larger than 3 5 for organic plus the flawless impact domestic is a 3 international 7 and spd is 3 that s our outlook for this year for the division gross margin is up 10 basis points if you exclude or if you make 2019 comparable with the excluding the flawless accounting we re up 50 basis points apples to apples marketing is up 10 basis points again we re investing incrementally behind these brands and behind these big launches you see on the table today as well as flawless sg a we re going to leverage by 10 basis points and operating margin on a reported basis is up 10 basis points but apples to apples up 50 basis points the effective tax rate is 21 the effective tax rate for 2018 was 21 for 2019 it was slightly below 21 and for 2020 we think it s 21 what does that mean it means all of our eps growth is largely the operating income growth eps range from 7 to 9 mid point is 8 and then cash from ops is 890 million so as matt talked about this year as a record we would have a new record for next year okay so here are some details on the outlook we start with our 8 evergreen model 8 plus 2 accretion for flawless tariffs is a minus 1 drag we re getting a hit with tariffs 4b hitting flawless and our showerhead business to the tune of a drag of about 1 on eps marketing investments for the new launch that s the 10 basis points you guys saw on the earlier page and so that s how we get to the midpoint of 7 to 9 and 8 we focused on gross margin for a long long time it s a hallmark of this company gross margin as matt said is in everyone s bonus gross margin drives cash flow cash flow drives valuation so we had an inflection point of 44 4 in 2018 we recovered nicely in 2019 and we re going to continue to improve in 2020 so in 2020 here are the details plus 80 basis points as we continue to get some benefits carryover from price and as well as higher volume inflation continues to be a drag of 150 basis point that s largely pretty much across the board from a commodity perspective i would say commodities were flat to up slightly up some examples for you ethylene is up mid single digits clay is up high single digits we have pcr resin as an example which is high up significantly htpe resin is flat so we have some headwinds on inflation tariffs are in that is in that number as well productivity programs are up 120 basis points just getting very very consistent with that we ve done some great work on the supply chain and then the acquisition kind of making that apples to apples again shows you how gross margin on a reported basis is plus 10 basis points but plus 50 basis points when you say it s comparable matt showed this slide earlier organic sales growth 10 year trend 3 5 which is fantastic in 2020 our expectations are no different 2019 was the first time since 15 that we had a 3 5 outlook and so we re proud to say that we re doing that again despite the pull back on private label and getting out of private label vitamins and a little bit of oxiclean laundry high promotion okay so just as important as volume i mean organic revenue growth is how we get there right so for the last 10 years organic revenue growth was 3 5 our volume growth on average is around 4 you can see on the graph that we kind of inflected in 2019 and volume went down right and price mix went up and our outlook for 2020 3 5 organic revenue growth about 50 50 is going to come from volume versus price mix then marketing spend again is up 10 basis points we re one of the top 20 advertisers within cpg so we just have a significant amount of firepower here that we put to use for our brands and then sg a on a reported basis it looks like it s gone up for the last few years but when you strip out the acquisition amortization it s actually very flattish so we re just really proud of this and 2020 is going to be no different we expect to improve and leverage sg a in 2020 we ve had consistent strong adjusted eps growth so high single digit double digits with tax reform and again high single digit in 2019 and 20 so our range is 7 to 9 mid point is 8 the peer average is about 1 to 2 this is my favorite slide best in class free cash flow conversion we spend a lot of time on this because we believe cash flow drives value and church dwight in 2018 was 124 free cash flow conversion that s free cash flow divided by net income the peer average was 85 a lot of companies target 90 here is a new slide for you here s our history over time 125 in 15 130 in 16 123 in 17 124 in 18 and 128 is what we just finished out in 2019 our outlook for 2020 is 119 so we just believe this is what sets us apart from our peer group to play in the 80s 90s or close to 100 and how do we do that well we do it a couple different ways one is really strong cash earnings the second one is our improvement in working capital cash conversion cycle we ve gone from 52 days in 2009 all the way down to 18 days in 2020 if you strip out the last two acquisitions we ve done this shows you how good we re doing it at really moving the needle in working capital trying to get down to zero that s still a goal so we ve gone if you strip those two out we re at seven days today our baseline changes because we ve added these two new businesses that have a chinese supply chain so now we start off at 18 and we ll continue to work through that number but you re going to see that we had great working capital improvement in 19 and we expect no different in 2020 and we have a very strong balance sheet we ended the year less than 2 times levered 1 9 times we expect by the end of 2020 to be about 1 5 times we have significant financial capacity right when you re 1 5 times levered by the end of the year you have the ability to do deals our prioritized uses of free cash flow has been the same for many years number one is tsr accretive m a number two is tsr accretive m a but debt reduction is number two and that s where we re going to use the cash for this year number three is npd number four is capex for organic growth and then number five is dividends or buybacks we re not a capital intensive company we re bumping up about 90 million next year and that s still less than 2 of sales we have a great dividend increase in 2020 it s 5 5 this is 119 years consecutively paying a dividend and then here is a new slide for you over the last three years our average in the peer group for dividend annual growth rate was 8 and that s the top tier of all of our peer set and so with that i ll invite the management team up and we ll answer any questions questions and answers matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer well all the hands are up hands not even up here yet okay nik nik modi rbc capital markets analyst i finally beat someone taller than me so i guess two questions i remember i don t know maybe it was 10 years ago 7 years ago compaction was a pretty big deal for church dwight from a margin perspective so i was hoping to get some perspective from you on the new product launch and what that means for shipping costs and just packaging costs and how you think about that and then the second is when it comes to flawless i know there s kind of conflict right between the as seen on tv and the merchandising aspect and so just thinking longer term is there a plan to like completely migrate this to a in store and digital and online product where you don t have that comp because you guys have really execution merchandising display activity so just was hoping to get some clarity on the long term plan there matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer well i ll take that one first yes i mean the plan for flawless system migrated from as seen on tv brand and completely into the wet shave aisle and completely vacate that part of the store because in a lot of stores it s not in a very attractive place so if you look at one major retailers by automotive but when we bought it we said no this is a brand that s going to have legs at long term and it belongs to wet shave aisle and one major retailer is getting behind it right now so over time that s what you re going to see happening it s happening right now in 2020 your other question was about compaction so when compaction happen there is one major retailer that drove that many many years ago that s not on the horizon right now for the industry i mean right now one would argue that the biggest form of compaction is pods so that pods at some point if pods at some point plateaus i think it s possible then we would go back to it may be a major compaction for liquid laundry detergent but that is clear enough on horizon right now were you asking the question about that new product that we have online i ll let britta take a swing at that one and what the insight was around that britta bomhard executive vice president chief marketing officer i think you re talking about the product i showed that s an e commerce play right so it s not in mass distribution because i think i ve said that and you ve seen our ambition to grow on the online class of trade because that s where all the consumers go and a lot of shopping happens and currently there is not a good loan resolution there and that s why we ve developed this specific product for that class of trade and we re seeing phenomenal results nik modi rbc capital markets analyst great thank you matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay bill bill chappell suntrust robinson humphrey analyst yeah sticking on the laundry side maybe first on clean simple can you give us a little more color is this incremental shelf space how cannibalistic do you expect it to be and then also i mean and maybe it s in the plans there is not a pod form coming out i guess on the initial launch well it seems that tide is coming at you with the tide simply version of pods so maybe the thought behind that of is are you seeing pods in your category start to level out where it s not as important do you not see this as big of a threat so any more color both around what the shelf space looks like and how you expect this to interact with the core brand and then also just from the pod standpoint the competitive launch matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer yes so clean i ll let paul comment at some point but clean simple whenever you launch a new product in liquid laundry under the arm hammer brand you re going to have some cannibalization but this one there will be some cannibalization but net it will be incremental to us and we think as well to the category as far as are we going to move into pods for clean simple we wouldn t disclose what our plans might be with respect to the clean simple as a platform could it happen absolutely bill i ll let paul comment as well some retailer reception to clean simple paul wood executive vice president us sales yeah i ll be a little guarded just in the message more for competitive reasons than i am to avoid your question but what i would tell you is with every launch we are going to have that cannibalization where you have the incrementality absolutely this one is a little different though the story on this one of everything britta showed in the marketing and the timing what the consumers are looking for in the health and wellness front just the other trends going on makes us a very interesting story as you re pitching it to get incremental space different space display space other things in the store i would tell you it s happening as we speak right now the resets so i don t want to give away what others are doing but i d encourage you the next couple of weeks to get out to a retail loved to have retail with you and show you first hand this one is a little different i would also tell you on the insights front we believe this isn t just looking at the consumer within our set today buying another yellow bottle this is going to get some attention on shelf from maybe you re not buying it today this is going to bring you in the clean simple the marketing grid has got behind it you just saw fraction of it today in the shopper marketing we re doing with retailer is going to be a little special so i m excited i am going to temper my vocabulary here but love to talk to you more on this one matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay rupesh rupesh parikh oppenheimer co inc analyst so i guess just my first question with flawless just curious what drove the shortfall in q4 and as you look to this year just want to get a sense it seems like distribution is driving all the growth just wanted to get a sense of velocity the contributor and then also do you expect any inventory adjustments matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer yeah so in the fourth quarter we were down year over year so business was 180 million in 2018 it was 186 million in 2019 we bought the business we thought it would be higher by the end of the year we know why a couple of things we disclosed we had an issue with one large retailer bed bath beyond and we also delayed a launch into 2020 now as far as the consumption goes consumption was down significantly in the fourth quarter we expect that to continue but to start to recover in the first quarter and by the time we get to the second quarter we re in the new launch and also the new distribution we expect consumption in measured channels because measured channels in this for this category is less than 50 but you ll start to see in measured channels a year over year increase and we think it s going to build from q2 q3 and q4 so i think a lot of the growth is ahead of us starting in q2 as a result of the new razor rick dierker executive vice president chief financial officer yes and i would just add i would just add to that from an organic growth perspective right we re calling 50 basis points for tailwinds from flawless in q1 we think it ll be flat to slightly down and but pretty much 90 basis points to 100 basis points of tailwind in the second half and that s how you get to the 50 basis points for the full year for organic rupesh parikh oppenheimer co inc analyst okay great and then matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer do you have another one rupesh rupesh parikh oppenheimer co inc analyst yeah one quick one so just in your guidance what are you assuming for the promotional environment matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay so on the promotional environment we ve talked about every quarter and as many of you know the promotional environment generally talking about the household side of the house and not a personal care and when we say household it s about laundry and we re talking about litter i ll take litter first the litter category is pretty tame right now as far as the promotional environment so if you look at sequentially it was pretty much flattish and even year over year there is no story there so we think it s steady as you go in litter i think you got to keep in mind is that in the litter category these hard fought price increases it s unlikely that the suppliers are going to want to deal that that the hard one increased back to the consumers so i wouldn t expect that to change in 2020 laundry same story i mean q4 was our lowest quarter of the year 25 sold on deal and the category was 35 and liquid laundry little bit higher it was 37 sold on deal but two big suppliers would be church dwight and henkel both down sequentially from q2 pardon me q3 to q4 and procter was up it kind of filled the void in the promotional space we expect that to continue in 2020 okay you re next yeah rupesh parikh oppenheimer co inc analyst okay thank you just on the sorry 3 5 organic growth like and you re exiting that you said is now out of the vitamin so the vitamin business in private label is that going to be i m assuming that growth was more dilutive to your growth or it was actually growing faster so that 3 5 on a more continuing space is like a 4 or is not is small relative to make to move the needle matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer yes i ll take a swing at this and then rick can jump in yes so we call it 3 5 for 2020 our run rate in the second half of 2019 as a company is 4 we ve said hey that s going to accelerate by 50 basis points because of flawless from 4 to 4 5 so we have 100 basis points go in other way for two reasons one exiting private label vitamins and number two we re continuing to pull back on oxiclean promotions now with that 100 basis points the lion s share of that is the vitamin business we have stepped up our innovation over the last couple of years in vitamins if you saw the slide that we had earlier you ll see if you went back to 16 and 17 we had like 6 new launches a year 18 from 19 we had 22 new launches and next we re going to have 17 new launches so but this is the right time to exit our private label it came into the company with the acquisition and it s lower margin and we think it s fine rick dierker executive vice president chief financial officer yes i would just add that business was flattish the private label business for vitamins it wasn t declining or anything like that we just felt that that wasn t the right strategic choice for the company so we decided to proactively get out of it rupesh parikh oppenheimer co inc analyst and that is i think that is accretive to margins if i assuming right on exiting to end that business or that s not rick dierker executive vice president chief financial officer it s when you think about the scale and the size of that business right where if we give you a sense of it if we re saying 100 basis points is going down for those two things maybe two thirds of that is the private label and one third of that is the laundry stuff so any impact on margin is pretty minimal matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer and following up on bill s question if i may on the clean simple is that a margin accretive innovation or in the meantime you might have like what is the price point that you re positioning at this point hey paul do you want to take a swing at the price points paul wood executive vice president us sales yes so the price points this is going to be right in line with our existing lineup so just as britta was talking about the efficacy and it being equal that s how it will show up for shelf as well and that s a really big message that our retailers really resonated with them that it was going to be line priced rick dierker executive vice president chief financial officer and then from a margin basis we wouldn t really say much but it s at brand average year one we have of course cost to drive volume for incrementality matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay joe joe altobello raymond james associates analyst thanks just wanted to get a bit more color on the increase in marketing spend obviously a big in the fourth quarter and it sounds like you re looking for about a 1 point of headwind on eps growth in 2020 what s driving the increase is it bigger new launches and what particular brands is it going behind and are you shifting dollars away from promo into marketing matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer is the question with respect to fourth quarter joe altobello raymond james associates analyst fourth quarter and 2020 as well matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay well fourth quarter we could see what was coming and we are doing well on top line and gross margin so we have a chance to reinvest both in marketing and in sg a we call that all places we invested in sg a so obviously we re able to throw a lot of money behind on the brands that and that always helps you going into the new year as your question about 2020 is the 10 basis points uptick joe altobello raymond james associates analyst yes more so that the 1 point of eps headwind that you re expecting to from launches rick dierker executive vice president chief financial officer the 10 basis points does represent the 1 eps drag and it s really for the new launches right the one on the table we ll really get behind that in a big way the new razor for flawless get behind that in a big way and then maybe britta if you want to talk about britta bomhard executive vice president chief marketing officer yes so we have a couple of exciting product as you saw so for example batiste foam we are category leader and as you ve seen there is a huge household penetration opportunity it s also a new hair type so we re going to spend some money on educating consumers about a new way particularly women with curly and dry hair matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer and maybe one more i had i just thought of is we showed you household penetration for waterpik in the us versus internationally and we found that it s very responsive to advertising and so now we re going to start rolling that out in europe and canada and australia so that marketing investment is happening globally as well joe altobello raymond james associates analyst and just one for steve the increase in operating margin for international this year is pretty big is that coming from sales leverage among other things or cost savings programs what s driving that steven p cugine executive vice president international and gnpi yes so i think there s a couple of things we had some expense in the year that we re not going to recover we feel like we ve made investments on top of that that we re not going to repeat again in next year i would say that s a large part of that and there is some mix as well joe altobello raymond james associates analyst okay thanks matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay steve stephen powers deutsche bank analyst okay i do have a question for steve but something rick said earlier prompted another question why would flawless have any impact on organic regardless of what it does in the first quarter given that you didn t owner it a year ago rick dierker executive vice president chief financial officer it doesn t i was trying to give you a sense that on a reported basis in q1 that it could be flat to down the organic impact is 50 basis points for the full year all of that s in the second half around 100 basis points matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay perfect and then internationally maybe you could get a lot going on but maybe you could rank order the growth initiatives you have on top 3 whether you think about it by brand by geography or by category and then as you think forward with the commitments or margin expansion as an evergreen does that does that inhibit your ability to kind of press on growth as you have been or should we expect some deceleration back down toward that evergreen s six ish level rick dierker executive vice president chief financial officer no we feel really confident i mean we see the business accelerating as you saw in 2019 and we see that continuing into 2020 again with less requirement for investments because we think we have the right kind of staffing level in each one of the regions china was a big investment over the last couple of years as we ve built our own team in china plus we spent money on slotting getting product into that market so we think all of that whether it would be latin america which has been growing very nicely for us and in asia pac whether it would be china or southeast asia we ve made a lot of investments in the past and now we think we can reap the benefits of continued strong organic growth without those investments repeating that s just that s why we feel so confident that we can continue to deliver on the operating margin because we re going to get leverage in the p l so we re going to get that on marketing and we re going to get that on sg a for sure stephen powers deutsche bank analyst it is the growth investment skewed anywhere i mean are you more excited about emerging markets about rick dierker executive vice president chief financial officer you know it s a funny thing and is here he runs our gmg business and he would say this year we had strong growth in emea and in latin america latin america is smaller for us but fast growing we made those investments in china we saw very strong china growth in 2019 and we expect strong growth in southeast asia as well asia in particular we see is real growth engine long term for the company because we re just still young and small but growing fast matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay swing to this side of the table kevin kevin grundy jefferies co analyst perfect kevin grundy of jefferies i had a question on international as well so it works out so connecting the dots just to sort of pick up where you left off there steve given that why the implied deceleration in the outlook for international and i don t want to diminish 7 which is outstanding but you guys haven t done a 7 in the past five years in the region and now you have a presence in china so i m just trying to connect the dots with that and then more broadly maybe matt you can chime in the role in m a and how you potentially see that longer term in growing your international business and the last just like from a capital planning perspective when do certain markets you potentially consider moving them from the export model to the subsidiary model what sort of like a tipping point how do you think about that and implications from a income statement and from balance sheet perspective thanks matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay i ll try to remember all that let s start off with the current year so we have an algorithm of 6 annually so we always go back to that can we sustain 6 year after year after year and if you look at what steve has been doing in international is hitting out of the park and so now we got a big plan for this year you might say you re sad because it s not 9 but we re not a company that s going to get way out over our skus so we think we got a strong plan for 2020 we don t view that as a deceleration we look at that as we re consistently now delivering above our algorithm you asked the question about international so we have done some m a internationally over the past few years viviscal was a is an international brand our waterpik had some international as well we bought the anusol brand from j j and so we re putting a lot of effort behind those and we get a lot of traction so steve and his gang have done a great job taking those international markets so we re continually scanning for things that we can acquire and we can put into our infrastructure and leverage it but we re pretty fussy about what we re going to buy and as you know you had a third one though the third question kevin grundy jefferies co analyst yeah when does it tip to go direct matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer yeah ok i ll go steve can say what we ve done in germany steven p cugine executive vice president international and gnpi yeah so we look at markets where we can go direct and it really is all about sg a leverage so how concentrated is the retail environment and in germany it s quite concentrated so we were able to go direct in germany and manage that p l so we get returns fast my two buddies down here they re pretty disciplined about spending and returns as you can imagine so you really need like a 20 to 1 relationship in terms of sg a investment to sales growth and so where the markets are young and highly fragmented from a retail environment it takes a lot more sg a to make that happen so we know the underlying economic model for us what we need to have to shift from an export market to a subsidiary market and we ll make those calls as we see fit but that is not required for us to hit our evergreen target matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay alright same table jason jason english goldman sachs analyst good afternoon and thank you two very different topics for questions first sticking on international but with a supply chain angle can you update us on the status of tariffs on your supply chain and also whether or not we should be considering any risk related to the coronavirus in terms of supply and manufacturing of whether it d be the waterpik or i m not sure where flawless is manufactured whether we should be cognizant of that as well second is on private label could you size of 100 bps drag how much of it is from the private label exit any reason to think that may actually suck some capacity out of the industry and help your branded side and is there also maybe on the other side of that risk presumably a good time to exit would have been five years ago when you re spending a lot of money to add capacity i imagine you chose not to because of there was a risk tethered to it if assuming that s the case then why is that there no longer that risk matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer i ll start with china so we re well aware of what s going on in china right now with the virus so we have checked with our suppliers of both of finished products and also business like flawless and spinbrush and waterpik and right now it looks like because of the extension of the chinese new year there is going to be a 1 maybe 2 week delay in start up of those manufacturing sites but because of our safety stock what s on the water and also you can overcome some of delay like that with air freight that we don t see a risk right now with what we know right now to quarter call that s in the it s in the release good on that one rick dierker executive vice president chief financial officer yeah and then on tariffs i would i try to talk about in my prepared remarks a little bit but that 1 drag on eps is tariffs that s really the four b list that went into effect on december 15 and we re getting hit on showerheads and flawless so you can do the math on what about 1 eps drag is but it s a couple of cents and then your other question on private label vitamins of 100 basis points decline in organic growth i had said about 60 is piece of the private label vitamin beginning to exit right it s a two year process so 50 bps of the 100 is from private label vitamins and i don t know rick if you want to say anything else about the supply chain in china or are you good rick spann executive vice president global operations yeah matt pretty much covered it we re working very closely with our suppliers and what we know so far is the one to two week delay that matt referenced on starting up after chinese new year we have ample safety stock don t anticipate a material impact to q1 but it s something we ll continue to monitor on a regular basis matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay all right okay you ve been waving your hand for a while stephen powers deutsche bank analyst thanks matt wanted to talk about two different categories and just state of competition in laundry and cat litter and then also your expectations for fiscal 20 between volume versus price mix matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer i couldn t hear the very first part of it stephen powers deutsche bank analyst laundry and cat litter the state of competition matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer oh the state of competition in the laundry and litter category okay well i mean you saw the chart with respect to shares in laundry we had a great year in laundry arm hammer was up xtra for the first time in a longtime held share up a little bit and oxiclean we lost some share but that was as not as expected because we pulled back on promotions you also saw from the chart the dynamics over the last three years but who is winning and who is struggling we think we have an unfair competitive advantage in the laundry detergent because we have a value brand that s advertised which is arm hammer and arm hammer is 1 billion brand if you go across all of our categories and actually we ve done a wonderful job in positioning that product against sun over the last couple of years and we continue to win distribution so we ve got a long term plan and we aim to be the number two supplier of laundry detergent at some point in the litter category litter is a function of innovation and we have been the innovator in that category for many many years and we think that over time that is going to bode well for us as far as growing share in the future i commented earlier about the promotional environment it is pretty much pretty tepid i would say in both categories i don t expect that to change in litter as we said because we re not going to deal back your price increases and i do think that the reduction in the amount sold on deal in the laundry category is really de facto price increase we want list price increases in laundry but the pull back in promotions as a group over time is de facto an increase in price and it improves margins steven p cugine executive vice president international and gnpi and matt if you want me talk about just how we advertise oxi laundry and what s this done to the additives category matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer you can do that steven p cugine executive vice president international and gnpi well sometimes myopically we just look at oxi laundry is down a little bit in share but we really didn t take a broader brush and say since we launched oxiclean laundry we ve gone from a 42 share in additive to 56 share in additives so we re really happy with our oxiclean megabrand matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer i hope everybody paid attention to that so if you go back and say wow you know oxiclean launched into premium laundry detergent and we re sad because it didn t work out no so in stain fighters we had a 42 market share when we launched oxiclean over in liquid laundry it went from 42 to 56 today so all that effort paid off and so we re making a lot more money today so that brand is alive and well britta bomhard executive vice president chief marketing officer can i add something so you see matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer let s pile on here this is good britta bomhard executive vice president chief marketing officer sorry matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer let s pile on britta bomhard executive vice president chief marketing officer yes well i love that brand so i have to talk about brands and i think you ve seen the more power to you and what it does for us we now have a similar and that s work your magic on oxiclean which is equally working extremely well across the different components of oxiclean so if we have several very clear evidence the lifts after we advertise and then it s across the different sub segments of oxiclean as well so i m very confident positive that oxiclean is a very very strong brand and we continue to grow matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay all right it looks like we might be done hey i want to thank everybody for coming today we had great questions and looking forward to talking to you at the end of the first quarter duration 79 minutes call participants matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer britta bomhard executive vice

church dwight co inc nyse chd q4 2019 earnings call 1 00 p m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer thank you all for coming today and thanks to everyone who is dialing in from officer or home i m going to begin with the safe harbor statement i recommend that everybody read that at your leisure i ll tell you who is with us today from management we have our cmo britta bomhard our head of international and global new products steve cugine for general counsel if you have any legal questions rick dierker our cfo rick spann who runs supply chain and paul wood would who runs the us sales all right so here is i m going to give you the short story right now so you don t have to really pay attention to the other 150 slides we had a terrific year this is the second consecutive year that our company grew organic sales 4 the us posted 4 organic sales growth and 10 out of 12 of our power brands grew or held share the international posted 9 2 organic growth and continues to be a juggernaut for the company and as we ended the year organic growth returned to the specialty products business after two down years last time we had an up quarter was q4 2017 and the reason it turned positive is because the dairy market became healthy and another encouraging sign is that domestic volumes turned positive in the fourth quarter and finally we had record cash from operations in 2019 so now looking ahead to 2020 we re calling 3 5 organic growth and that is net of exiting the low margin gummy private label business and consistent with our evergreen model we re calling 7 to 9 eps growth and that is top tier in cpg i want to recap for a minute why church dwight is a standout in the consumer space number one we have an evergreen model that our shareholders are very familiar with as our employees number 2 we focus on cash number 3 we have an ability to execute and that s what drives our performance we deliver meaningful topline and bottom line growth year after year we have a very lean company with the highest sales per employee of any of our peers and net sales per employee stat is an underappreciated metric we are innovators with new product offerings across many categories year after year and we are becoming digitally savvy 8 of our sales are online today and that does not include buy online pickup in store if we included that it would be much higher than 8 we make good choices when it comes to acquisitions those choices have led us to dry shampoo gummy vitamins women s hair removal water flossers and hair thinning solutions so we believe there is no better place to invest in cpg than church dwight so here s our track record let s go to the next slide there we are so looking over the last three five and 10 years we ve delivered double digit tsr returns to our shareholders and if you look at 2019 8 3 and that s on top of a 2018 that was plus 30 so let s move on to the formal part of the program so who we are why we re winning britta is going to come up and talk about them give you an update for the master brand and also britta and i are going to ham and egg the consistent innovation story steve is going to come up and talk about international i m going to come back and tell you about animal productivity and how we run the company and then we re going to end with rick on financials all right first who we are so i talked about our evergreen business model this is in grain not only in the hearts of our employees but all of our long term shareholders as well 3 topline 8 bottom line and if you say well how s that going for you and you look at what the last 10 years the average organic sales growth has been 3 6 so where is that 3 coming from well it s coming 2 from the us 6 international and 5 specialty products we don t always hit these in the market any one year but that is the long term algorithm if you say what are your brands we have lots and lots of brands but we have 12 power brands and those 12 power brands account for 80 of our revenues and profits and we have a very well balanced portfolio little bit more than half is or if you look at the consumer products part of the house personal care 49 household 44 you can see specialty products at 7 now it s a diversified portfolio in that 63 is premium and 37 is value that means we perform well in virtually any economy and we have a lot of runway for international so international has been a juggernaut as i ve said for the last five years still only 17 of the company so we ve got a long way to go there and we do operate in the lands of the giants you could see we have 4 4 billion in sales all of our competitors are significantly larger than we are we think this gives us an advantage so we work fast we re nimble when you have only 4 800 employees you can make quick decisions you can move faster communication is easier and you can adapt to change better and we have a long history of acquisitions we ve added almost 3 billion in sales since 2004 over the last 15 years and a lot of that came from acquisitions and we have very specific acquisition criteria we re only going to look for a brand that has number 1 or number 2 share high growth high margin needs to be asset light we need to be able to leverage our supply chain footprint and we must have a sustainable competitive advantage and since the year 2000 so over the last 19 years 20 years we ve acquired 11 out of our 12 power brands in the year 2000 the only big brand we had was arm hammer so what we say around the house is 12 brands today 20 tomorrow now why are we winning five reasons one we re in the right categories two we know how to grow shares three we don t have a high exposure to private label we re growing online and we are on trend so let s look at the categories so if you look at the categories over the last four years in general our categories weighted average grew 3 so this is the underpinning for the company s long term organic growth of 3 and as far as growing share this is our report card you don t get this report card for many cpg companies but every year we tell you how we re doing so for our 12 major brands we maintain our growth share and you can see this year for the first time 10 out of 12 were green and we get lots of questions generally about the laundry category so what s the long term trend in laundry so over the last three years we ve added 120 basis points of share in laundry the other winner was procter gamble and the henkel has struggled now you know as we go from quarter to quarter we get lots of questions on non measured channels let me give you a sense for how big our non measured channels for some of our categories most of these categories are going to be 70 80 90 represented on nielsen but if you go to the far right you see some of our more recent categories power flossing hair thinning and even electric women s electric grooming are all significantly less than 50 so it s something to bear in mind going forward we have low exposure to private label the weighted average share of private label for our categories is only 12 only five of our categories have private label exposure and as you can see from the lines on that chart you can see it s relatively stable and we re growing online back in 2015 we were fourth quartile when it came to online sales today we re first quartile we hit our goal of 8 in 2019 and we have a goal to be over 9 in 2020 and we have lots of number 1 products on amazon and amazon of course is the number 1 online retailer okay on trend so going to roll through four of our brands and why we think we re on trend take batiste it s a business we acquired in 2011 so dry shampoo was a convenient solution to women between wet shampoos this was a business with 20 million in sales in 2011 if you look at what kind of runway do you have in the us well in the us 125 million women there are 125 million women over the age of 18 two thirds of them don t wash their hair every day and 13 of them today use dry shampoo now if you look at household penetration it s only 7 5 in the us so now if you want to try to figure out well how big could it be in the us we look at the uk the uk is the most mature dry shampoo market it s where it originated so if we compare where the us is the us is in the middle innings and we can see by in comparison to where the uk is that the dry shampoo market will double from 225 million at retail to 450 million over time so being the number 1 dry shampoo because we have a lot of runway ahead of us next up is women s electric hair removal we bought the number 1 women s electric hair remover in flawless so these are tools to remove if i go left to right face brow leg and whole body so women are looking for convenient ways to remove hair and if you look at the household penetration it s only 2 in the us and less than 2 in rest of the world so a lot of runway here for this business next up is water flossers we have the number 1 power flosser and recommended by the ada so what s the story there and we can do a show hands everybody knows 80 of people don t floss every day even though they should and consumers are discovering water flossers water flossers are the easiest solution to flossing again look at household penetration 22 in the us not bad but we think that could go as high as 48 if you just look at the penetration for electric toothbrushes and then if you look at the in europe for example it s only 3 to 5 so we re just getting started with water flossers outside the us again on trend got lots of runway ahead of us next up is gummy vitamins you know the story pretty well the gummy form is more appealing than pills and capsules and if you go back to when we bought the business the adult gummy form was 3 of the category now it s 18 and if you look at the size of the category it just continues to grow it grew from 15 16 17 from 800 million to 1 5 billion today lots of runway and then finally is hair thinning solutions we have the number 1 hair fiber and the number 1 hair thinning supplement and we all know it s on people s mind 40 of men and women have noticeable hair loss by the age of 40 so we ve great solutions to that okay now i m going to bring up britta to talk about the master brand britta bomhard executive vice president chief marketing officer hello everyone everybody awake so you might remember arm hammer is by far our biggest brand it is more than a million billion sorry dollar brand it s really important to us and you might remember from last year we presented our more power to you campaign year in this iconic institution now i know most of you are pretty skeptical you re a little bit like my boss is this really working so i thought why don t i share a couple of results first since we launched the campaign in 12 months we ve actually added 2 6 million households who are now buying arm hammer and that s an increase of 3 and this picture you are seeing here is actually it is currently nearly seven out of 10 households buying arm hammer and if this room is representative my ambition is actually to have three out of four households buying arm hammer so you might remember there is not many where the us is as united as having three out of four people agree that this is a great choice but what s more important you could now say well but you get them in via promotions no actually we have people spend more money on arm hammer and you see here they are spending 5 more so if you think about it what is a great sign for brand health more people buying it and spending more so i think that s a very clear answer that arm hammer is very healthy and growing wonderfully right there we go and i think for those of you who it saw last year you might want to note that we have arm hammer in every single one of our brands and categories and i want to show you couple of how we communicate about arm hammer and for those of you who have seen some of our cats they ve just got cuter so have a look at the cat that s a really distinctive campaign and is working really well for us you might not have seen this campaign because we just recently launched our arm hammer dental campaign at the very end of last year it s a very hard one to breakthrough so i hope a you appreciate how different it is to normal dental commercial you might see and secondly it also illustrates that this campaign works in no matter what category so let s look at that one challenged and checked how well the plaque removal is currently on what you use and moving on to our next you might know if you re not part of the burning man crowd and i m pretty sure most of us here in this room aren t then this one is what we say is a great deodorant is a broad spectrum of what we can do with the arm hammer campaign on every single of those different categories playing to what s important and what s the consumer insight but still bringing it altogether and driving the overall 1 billion brand so i think that s pretty unique but i m actually here to talk about something new which it s not too much of a reveal as it s standing or sitting on all your tables but our new clean and simple laundry detergent it s clean it s simple it s smart and it s powerful so what have we learned about consumers and you might have seen that in a few other areas in food the transparency in less is more in ingredients has already been quite established and this trend is now moving from what people ingested to what s on me and then two what s around me and this is where we have an amazing detergent which has a no compromise powerful clean laundry with a simple ingredient list so none of the others offer that and what s even better of it and it s a pity that my colleague carlos who heads up our r d is not here today but he and his team are really revolutionizing of how we look at making innovation one of part is there is a very different innovation culture we are connecting the different teams around r d in the different areas of expertise a lot more risk taken and obviously speed and that s what you can see here how we came up and looking at what s happening in the food industry it s a very clear trend which will come into the other areas and that s where our future works team actually discovered the clean and simple formulation so what s in there or better what s not in there because that s what consumers are asking so it doesn t have dies no added preservatives no phosphates no brighteners and no parabens sounds pretty attractive doesn t it but what s in there is six essential ingredients a hardworking cleaner active stain remover laundry booster baking soda of course water softener and fragrance and what s more and important it has few ingredients but it is as powerful as our best selling product which is arm hammer with oxiclean and as we said it has fewer ingredients not only as our own but the typical average laundry detergent has between 15 and 30 ingredients so we only have six and here less is more but not only that it s also very good for the environment so on the next iteration of laundry bottles you will actually see this back label which will talk about our partnership with the arbor day foundation where we helped planting trees for cleaner air and water this product has also been elected as a safer choice so we have that endorsement which is very important to reassure consumers and we are also using the green e which says it s with a 100 certified renewable electricity and of course we are one of the leading partners of howtorecycle which is in a lot of our labels and also graces this label as the bottle is fully recyclable and now you wonder how will we tell consumers about it so let s have a look hope you noticed we are helping women making the right choices and we have very positive feedback because it s such a good way to get it from a trusted brand like arm hammer and once we drive people to store this is what they will see in the future we have massive executions in stores and coming soon dollar general so what else do consumers want besides clean and simple there s other trends which are about sustainability and convenience and matt talked about online shopping lots and lots of people actually order online that s not as developed in the laundry area because it s difficult to shop big bottles so we have a solution for consumers who want convenience and sustainability because we have launched arm hammer plus oxiclean our best seller as a super concentrated laundry detergent it has 3 times more cleaning power but it has 37 less plastic and uses 30 less water so again fully on a sustainability trend and available to consumers who prefer shopping on e commerce i ve talked a lot about arm hammer we also have another exciting brand oxiclean and if i look around the room except for everybody who is on my team today you know that black clothes dark clothes are very important and about 42 of all wash loads get sorted into black dark colors and we have a solution for that so oxiclean dark protect which was specifically formulated for dark and black fabrics so as we are now in winter season take a note you might want to get one of those and with that i hand it over to matt who s going to share insights on hair care matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer all right obviously i m the expert on dry shampoo so if you re somebody with normal hair and you pick up an aerosol can of dry shampoo that s ok that might make my hair dryer so we said hey what s going to appeal to women with normal to dry hair so we said ok we re going to launch batiste waterless cleansing foam so this is something that you rub into your hair and refreshes your hair and dries in 60 seconds and we have four different variants that we re launching right now and now waterpik you also often hear us talk about waterpik water flosses for waterpik that business we re experts in water jet technology so that technology has been around for almost 50 years and so now we re coming out with a brand new the first known fda registered showerhead the insight here is that millions of americans discuss massage with their doctors it s something that waterpik folks started to look into so here it is water for wellness this fda registered power pulse showerhead and we ve done nine clinical studies and what those studies tell us is that these particular showerheads soothe muscles they increase flexibility and they promote better sleep and here is kind of a fun fact the average shower is eight to 12 minutes and what our consumers tell us is that these benefits they start feeling after two minutes using these showerheads really cool innovation okay as i talked about flawless earlier women are focused on convenient hair removal so new product from flawless is called nu razor this is waterless whole body hair removal anywhere anytime now flawless we ve got a lot of interest in flawless on the part of analysts and shareholders so have to give a little bit of an update on that one major retailer right now the reset has already happened from as seen on tv through the wet shave aisle and that s happening in a lot of retailers why is that important it s because the traffic in the wet shave aisle is 4 times the traffic in as seen on tv so this is launching right now with one major retailer and after two weeks the pos consumption is up 7 and that s just one major retailer we know what kind of wins we have for 2020 and our total distribution point is going to be up 15 in 2020 and recall if you read in the press release that we expect the flawless sales to be up 15 and this is part of the underpinning for that that as well as the nu razor launch we think we re going to be in a good shape for the coming year all right next up is natural toothpaste are growing 14 times the rate of the toothpaste category so we re introducing arm hammer essentials toothpaste two different variants and we ve gotten really really good reception from retailers particularly the

coming in 2020 in other categories so stay tuned you will hear about those later in the year and next up is steve to tell you our fabulous international story come on up steve steven p cugine executive vice president international and gnpi thank you matt excellent so i m pleased to be here to share with you the fabulous international growth story so as matt already talked about the evergreen target for international is 6 per year in 2014 we delivered 535 million in sales we finished 2019 at 756 million in sales the important note here is that we firmly believe that we reached global scale there isn t a market that we re not in today and where we can t reach with our ourselves or through our existing subsidiary markets or through our gmg business i think even more impressive than the size of the business is that we ve tripled the organic growth rate from roughly 3 to about 9 so significantly larger business tripling the growth rate this is an important chart that we show every year but there is some new information here our global markets group is now 33 of the total business for the first time it is the largest segment within the international business followed by canada europe three countries mexico and australia we have grown historically well above our evergreen target of 6 in 2019 we hit 9 2 an outstanding year and we leave the year with momentum delivering 10 6 so we feel the wind at our back let s break that down in a little more detail our subsidiary markets delivered 5 2 and our gmg business a whopping 19 2 our subsidiaries are largely in developed markets so 5 2 in developed markets is really outstanding performance our brands are healthy whether they be in emerging markets through gmg or in our subsidiary markets so we re excited about the performance of both of these businesses the gmg business is certainly an engine of growth for the division and for the company since 2014 when we initiated the start of our new growth strategy for international this business has delivered 19 cagr throughout its life cycle and again 19 we did 19 2 lot of 19s in there and it s driven by our core brands so we re driving arm hammer batiste waterpik vms oxiclean sterimar femfresh and now flawless we continue to invest in building capabilities around the world as you know year in and year out i ve been up here talking about the investments that we ve made in southeast asia and then talked about china we continue to make incremental investments in china southeast asia germany fast growing market for us in europe and in central america we ve taken the opportunity to localize the content that we give to consumers because these brands need to show up differently market by market so they are relevant we are investing particularly last year and this year in technology because matt talked about speed of decision making we feel is a differentiator for the company that is also true in these very dynamic international markets we invest a lot in our gmg distributor training and regulatory affairs we want to make sure that our partners in particular markets know as much as we do we provide them innovation case studies they share case studies so they are an extension of our family and we think that is unique to church dwight so we are absolutely committed to 6 organic growth moving forward we believe we have a runway for our existing brands we have demonstrated our ability to grow acquired brands waterpik now flawless our gmg group will continue to post double digit growth and we ve made investments in fast growing markets that we think we can leverage because we feel that we have a scaled global business for the first time we re going to make a new commitment and that commitment is not only organic growth but we re going to continue to expand operating margin year in and year out we re going to take a big step change from from 2019 to 2020 and part of our evergreen target is to deliver another 50 bps of growth of operating margin expansion and that is on top of any incremental investments that we re going to make to ensure that we have the capabilities around the world so in summary one we have the right strategies for growth we ve demonstrated that we know that two we have brands that consumers love around the world three we ve built a management team that is outstanding and several of them around the world are here today so to them i say thank you and we feel that we are just starting but there is a lot of runway in international markets for church dwight s products matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay animal productivity so back to the 3 algorithm 2 us 6 international and 5 for specialty products where is the 5 going to come from well we have a bulk chemicals business which is bulk sodium bicarbonate and then animal productivity 6 how is it been working out for you not very well so let s talk about why is that so just going to go slow on this when you look at the top of the chart that s specialty products division organic sales growth since 2011 so what do you notice you re up in 2011 down in 12 and 13 up in 14 22 6 down in 15 and 16 up in 17 down 18 and 19 back up in 20 and then below it you say ok what was going on milk prices and you can see as milk prices recover that s when you see a green for the growth of the specialty products business so we knew that a few years ago in 2015 we said hey we got to start moving into other species and in 2015 99 of the animal productivity business was dairy and today that s not true it was 1 nondairy today it 27 nondairy so we think that we re going to be able to flatten this out over time now why don t we go into other species well because of the demand for protein and it s simply population growth we had 7 7 billion people today going to 9 8 billion by the middle of the century and antibiotics are out of favor and the consumers are telling retailers and farmers hey no antibiotics no hormones no chemicals and if you look at the stats you see that there is a 40 decrease in the use of animal probiotics since 2015 so that bodes well for us because we bought two businesses one was called vicor the other was agro biosciences they get us into prebiotics and custom probiotics we were in nutritional supplements for dairy we then got into prebiotics and probiotics so now we have a nice portfolio for not only dairy but cattle swine and poultry as i said before the non dairy business is 27 of animal productivity today we think that s going to have big growth in 2020 and we do get lots of questions about milk hey people raise their hands isn t milk consumption in the united states on decline absolutely so if you look at this chart here the per capita consumption in 2015 was 174 pounds it s annually more recently it s 164 pounds but if you look what s going on with cheese there s a big offset to that it takes 10 pounds of milk to make one pound of cheese i know when you come to the church dwight conferences you always walk away learning something you didn t know so when you think about milk also think cheese cheese is a big offset for the decline in milk production so the dairy industry does have growth ahead of it so we do feel good long term about our algorithm of 5 we have the trusted brand the arm hammer brand goes across prebiotics probiotics all of our products we are aligned with the consumer trend we re now into multiple species and all the growth is ahead of us particularly internationally now i want to talk about how we run the company there s five operating principles one we leverage brands we have 12 brands that account for 80 of our revenues and profits these are brands that consumers love second thing we ve long been a friend of the environment and i m going to go into that a little bit deeper in a moment and we leverage people we have highly productive people an environment where people do matter and finally we re asset light we leverage our assets and if you do those four things well you re going to have really good returns but because one of our competencies is identifying acquiring and integrating businesses we turn our good returns into great returns as i said here are the brands we have brands consumers love as far as a friend of the environment goes over 100 years ago we started using recycled paperboard in our cartons in the 1970s we were the first and we were the only corporate sponsor of the first earth day actually 20 years later in 1990 we re still the only corporate sponsor of earth day and we were the first to take phosphates out of laundry detergent more recently we ve been more focused on green global electricity demand supply by renewable sources both wind and power and we ve been planting lots of trees with arbor day and we all remember from fifth grade science that trees take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and they turn it into oxygen what are some of our goals we want to reduce water and wastewater by 25 by 2022 we want to recycle more we want it 75 by the end of this year and finally we want to be carbon neutral so 100 carbon neutral by 2025 and that s through having green electricity and also planting millions and millions of trees but that s our goal today we re at 60 carbon neutral what that means is we offset 60 of the co2 that we put into the atmosphere okay and we ve been getting some recognition for that as well we regularly show up on the list of barron s forbes the epa list of companies that are faithful to the environment all right now i also mentioned highly productive people in a place where people matter this is a statistic that is interesting this revenue per employee so you can see we re on the far right we re over 900 000 right now on our way to 1 million per employee and you can see where our peers are we think this is very representative of how lean the company is and the thing that most people can t tell about any company you invest in is what is the culture and the culture in our company is as follows and we talk about this both inside and outside the company it s blue collar high aptitude underdogs we re digitally savvy we embrace diversity and we like taking risks and because that is the environment within our company and you can t just snap your fingers flip a light switch and create that i didn t create that that s been there for many many years it s the greatest asset of the company and i think that s one of the reasons why we re so successful year after year after year now we have tremendous financial literacy within the company most companies will focus on revenue and eps we also focus on gross margin and that s 25 of everyone s annual bonus and when it s in your bonus you ask questions like hey what s gross margin and how can we get it because it affects me so how we get it is we have a good to great program that s our continuous improvement program we are continually optimizing our plans new products are launched with higher gross margins than the products they replace and when we buy businesses we make them better we expand the gross margins of the businesses that we acquire we have very simple compensation structure you can see on the left side of the pie net revenue and eps on the right side we focus on gross margin which is uncommon as the metric within incentive compensation program and cash from operations we ve long described ourselves as free cash flow junkies and we still are all right i m going to bring up rick to talk about financials now rick dierker executive vice president chief financial officer all right thanks matt good afternoon so i m going to go through three things we re going to go through the 2019 results for the quarter for the full year and then go through the outlook and before we do that we ll just start with evergreen model because we always do 3 topline growth and 8 eps growth and then the drill down for that is 3 organic net sales growth 25 basis points of gross margin expansion flat on marketing as a percent higher dollars typically with revenue growth we leverage sg a and we get to 50 basis points of operating margin expansion and an 8 eps growth so that s the backdrop so how did we do in q4 you heard from matt already you saw in the release this morning 4 4 organic revenue growth domestic was 3 5 international was 10 5 and spd for the first time in eight quarters with positive organic growth which is great adjusted gross margin was 170 basis points up i ll walk through the detail of that in a minute marketing was up 240 basis points so that s the highest spend rate we ve had in 2019 just 37 million more year over year it s a very significant increase sg a was up largely because of the acquisition our tsa agreement as well as the amortization with that deal adjusted eps was 0 55 versus the 0 54 outlook so on a revenue basis the quarter was very strong 4 4 and it was very strong even versus a strong year ago 4 3 so on a stacked basis 8 7 if you run your eyes across the page 4 5 in the first quarter 4 9 in the second 3 5 4 4 and then 4 4 for the year so for the full year like i said 4 4 domestic has a 4 in front of it that s fantastic as britta said 10 of 12 power brands grew share during the year internationally just heard from steve 9 is a great number and then spd was minus 3 gross margin was up 110 basis points i ll go through the detail gross margin in other slide marketing was up 10 basis points that s greater than our outlook and then adjusted sg a was also up for the same reasons i talked about in the quarter eps was up 9 to 2 47 and cash from operations was up to 865 million up 16 year over year just a fantastic result higher cash earnings and improved working capital which leads to free cash flow conversion of 128 which is industry leading and we have a slide on that so gross margin just to walk you through the puts and takes in q4 plus 60 basis points so that s really the we continue to get the benefit from price as well as higher volumes inflation is a 50 basis point drag for the quarter that has moderated a little bit since earlier in the year productivity programs are up 110 basis points it s been pretty consistent for the whole year and then acquisition so there s two parts of the acquisition 50 basis points from owning flawless 10 basis points is because they have a slightly higher gross margin in the company the other 40 basis points is acquisition accounting remember we took that the revenue minus cogs minus marketing marketing profit that s one line in net sales from the period of may through october and so when there is no offset it s a pure margin so gross margin expansion on a reported basis is 170 basis point and then on a comparable basis it would be 130 basis points so that s the quarter and for the full year many of the same things apply and comparable gross margin expansion is plus 70 basis points so just a fantastic year we raised gross margin i think 3 times throughout the year so on to 2020 so 6 5 reported sales growth that s larger than 3 5 for organic plus the flawless impact domestic is a 3 international 7 and spd is 3 that s our outlook for this year for the division gross margin is up 10 basis points if you exclude or if you make 2019 comparable with the excluding the flawless accounting we re up 50 basis points apples to apples marketing is up 10 basis points again we re investing incrementally behind these brands and behind these big launches you see on the table today as well as flawless sg a we re going to leverage by 10 basis points and operating margin on a reported basis is up 10 basis points but apples to apples up 50 basis points the effective tax rate is 21 the effective tax rate for 2018 was 21 for 2019 it was slightly below 21 and for 2020 we think it s 21 what does that mean it means all of our eps growth is largely the operating income growth eps range from 7 to 9 mid point is 8 and then cash from ops is 890 million so as matt talked about this year as a record we would have a new record for next year okay so here are some details on the outlook we start with our 8 evergreen model 8 plus 2 accretion for flawless tariffs is a minus 1 drag we re getting a hit with tariffs 4b hitting flawless and our showerhead business to the tune of a drag of about 1 on eps marketing investments for the new launch that s the 10 basis points you guys saw on the earlier page and so that s how we get to the midpoint of 7 to 9 and 8 we focused on gross margin for a long long time it s a hallmark of this company gross margin as matt said is in everyone s bonus gross margin drives cash flow cash flow drives valuation so we had an inflection point of 44 4 in 2018 we recovered nicely in 2019 and we re going to continue to improve in 2020 so in 2020 here are the details plus 80 basis points as we continue to get some benefits carryover from price and as well as higher volume inflation continues to be a drag of 150 basis point that s largely pretty much across the board from a commodity perspective i would say commodities were flat to up slightly up some examples for you ethylene is up mid single digits clay is up high single digits we have pcr resin as an example which is high up significantly htpe resin is flat so we have some headwinds on inflation tariffs are in that is in that number as well productivity programs are up 120 basis points just getting very very consistent with that we ve done some great work on the supply chain and then the acquisition kind of making that apples to apples again shows you how gross margin on a reported basis is plus 10 basis points but plus 50 basis points when you say it s comparable matt showed this slide earlier organic sales growth 10 year trend 3 5 which is fantastic in 2020 our expectations are no different 2019 was the first time since 15 that we had a 3 5 outlook and so we re proud to say that we re doing that again despite the pull back on private label and getting out of private label vitamins and a little bit of oxiclean laundry high promotion okay so just as important as volume i mean organic revenue growth is how we get there right so for the last 10 years organic revenue growth was 3 5 our volume growth on average is around 4 you can see on the graph that we kind of inflected in 2019 and volume went down right and price mix went up and our outlook for 2020 3 5 organic revenue growth about 50 50 is going to come from volume versus price mix then marketing spend again is up 10 basis points we re one of the top 20 advertisers within cpg so we just have a significant amount of firepower here that we put to use for our brands and then sg a on a reported basis it looks like it s gone up for the last few years but when you strip out the acquisition amortization it s actually very flattish so we re just really proud of this and 2020 is going to be no different we expect to improve and leverage sg a in 2020 we ve had consistent strong adjusted eps growth so high single digit double digits with tax reform and again high single digit in 2019 and 20 so our range is 7 to 9 mid point is 8 the peer average is about 1 to 2 this is my favorite slide best in class free cash flow conversion we spend a lot of time on this because we believe cash flow drives value and church dwight in 2018 was 124 free cash flow conversion that s free cash flow divided by net income the peer average was 85 a lot of companies target 90 here is a new slide for you here s our history over time 125 in 15 130 in 16 123 in 17 124 in 18 and 128 is what we just finished out in 2019 our outlook for 2020 is 119 so we just believe this is what sets us apart from our peer group to play in the 80s 90s or close to 100 and how do we do that well we do it a couple different ways one is really strong cash earnings the second one is our improvement in working capital cash conversion cycle we ve gone from 52 days in 2009 all the way down to 18 days in 2020 if you strip out the last two acquisitions we ve done this shows you how good we re doing it at really moving the needle in working capital trying to get down to zero that s still a goal so we ve gone if you strip those two out we re at seven days today our baseline changes because we ve added these two new businesses that have a chinese supply chain so now we start off at 18 and we ll continue to work through that number but you re going to see that we had great working capital improvement in 19 and we expect no different in 2020 and we have a very strong balance sheet we ended the year less than 2 times levered 1 9 times we expect by the end of 2020 to be about 1 5 times we have significant financial capacity right when you re 1 5 times levered by the end of the year you have the ability to do deals our prioritized uses of free cash flow has been the same for many years number one is tsr accretive m a number two is tsr accretive m a but debt reduction is number two and that s where we re going to use the cash for this year number three is npd number four is capex for organic growth and then number five is dividends or buybacks we re not a capital intensive company we re bumping up about 90 million next year and that s still less than 2 of sales we have a great dividend increase in 2020 it s 5 5 this is 119 years consecutively paying a dividend and then here is a new slide for you over the last three years our average in the peer group for dividend annual growth rate was 8 and that s the top tier of all of our peer set and so with that i ll invite the management team up and we ll answer any questions questions and answers matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer well all the hands are up hands not even up here yet okay nik nik modi rbc capital markets analyst i finally beat someone taller than me so i guess two questions i remember i don t know maybe it was 10 years ago 7 years ago compaction was a pretty big deal for church dwight from a margin perspective so i was hoping to get some perspective from you on the new product launch and what that means for shipping costs and just packaging costs and how you think about that and then the second is when it comes to flawless i know there s kind of conflict right between the as seen on tv and the merchandising aspect and so just thinking longer term is there a plan to like completely migrate this to a in store and digital and online product where you don t have that comp because you guys have really execution merchandising display activity so just was hoping to get some clarity on the long term plan there matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer well i ll take that one first yes i mean the plan for flawless system migrated from as seen on tv brand and completely into the wet shave aisle and completely vacate that part of the store because in a lot of stores it s not in a very attractive place so if you look at one major retailers by automotive but when we bought it we said no this is a brand that s going to have legs at long term and it belongs to wet shave aisle and one major retailer is getting behind it right now so over time that s what you re going to see happening it s happening right now in 2020 your other question was about compaction so when compaction happen there is one major retailer that drove that many many years ago that s not on the horizon right now for the industry i mean right now one would argue that the biggest form of compaction is pods so that pods at some point if pods at some point plateaus i think it s possible then we would go back to it may be a major compaction for liquid laundry detergent but that is clear enough on horizon right now were you asking the question about that new product that we have online i ll let britta take a swing at that one and what the insight was around that britta bomhard executive vice president chief marketing officer i think you re talking about the product i showed that s an e commerce play right so it s not in mass distribution because i think i ve said that and you ve seen our ambition to grow on the online class of trade because that s where all the consumers go and a lot of shopping happens and currently there is not a good loan resolution there and that s why we ve developed this specific product for that class of trade and we re seeing phenomenal results nik modi rbc capital markets analyst great thank you matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay bill bill chappell suntrust robinson humphrey analyst yeah sticking on the laundry side maybe first on clean simple can you give us a little more color is this incremental shelf space how cannibalistic do you expect it to be and then also i mean and maybe it s in the plans there is not a pod form coming out i guess on the initial launch well it seems that tide is coming at you with the tide simply version of pods so maybe the thought behind that of is are you seeing pods in your category start to level out where it s not as important do you not see this as big of a threat so any more color both around what the shelf space looks like and how you expect this to interact with the core brand and then also just from the pod standpoint the competitive launch matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer yes so clean i ll let paul comment at some point but clean simple whenever you launch a new product in liquid laundry under the arm hammer brand you re going to have some cannibalization but this one there will be some cannibalization but net it will be incremental to us and we think as well to the category as far as are we going to move into pods for clean simple we wouldn t disclose what our plans might be with respect to the clean simple as a platform could it happen absolutely bill i ll let paul comment as well some retailer reception to clean simple paul wood executive vice president us sales yeah i ll be a little guarded just in the message more for competitive reasons than i am to avoid your question but what i would tell you is with every launch we are going to have that cannibalization where you have the incrementality absolutely this one is a little different though the story on this one of everything britta showed in the marketing and the timing what the consumers are looking for in the health and wellness front just the other trends going on makes us a very interesting story as you re pitching it to get incremental space different space display space other things in the store i would tell you it s happening as we speak right now the resets so i don t want to give away what others are doing but i d encourage you the next couple of weeks to get out to a retail loved to have retail with you and show you first hand this one is a little different i would also tell you on the insights front we believe this isn t just looking at the consumer within our set today buying another yellow bottle this is going to get some attention on shelf from maybe you re not buying it today this is going to bring you in the clean simple the marketing grid has got behind it you just saw fraction of it today in the shopper marketing we re doing with retailer is going to be a little special so i m excited i am going to temper my vocabulary here but love to talk to you more on this one matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay rupesh rupesh parikh oppenheimer co inc analyst so i guess just my first question with flawless just curious what drove the shortfall in q4 and as you look to this year just want to get a sense it seems like distribution is driving all the growth just wanted to get a sense of velocity the contributor and then also do you expect any inventory adjustments matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer yeah so in the fourth quarter we were down year over year so business was 180 million in 2018 it was 186 million in 2019 we bought the business we thought it would be higher by the end of the year we know why a couple of things we disclosed we had an issue with one large retailer bed bath beyond and we also delayed a launch into 2020 now as far as the consumption goes consumption was down significantly in the fourth quarter we expect that to continue but to start to recover in the first quarter and by the time we get to the second quarter we re in the new launch and also the new distribution we expect consumption in measured channels because measured channels in this for this category is less than 50 but you ll start to see in measured channels a year over year increase and we think it s going to build from q2 q3 and q4 so i think a lot of the growth is ahead of us starting in q2 as a result of the new razor rick dierker executive vice president chief financial officer yes and i would just add i would just add to that from an organic growth perspective right we re calling 50 basis points for tailwinds from flawless in q1 we think it ll be flat to slightly down and but pretty much 90 basis points to 100 basis points of tailwind in the second half and that s how you get to the 50 basis points for the full year for organic rupesh parikh oppenheimer co inc analyst okay great and then matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer do you have another one rupesh rupesh parikh oppenheimer co inc analyst yeah one quick one so just in your guidance what are you assuming for the promotional environment matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay so on the promotional environment we ve talked about every quarter and as many of you know the promotional environment generally talking about the household side of the house and not a personal care and when we say household it s about laundry and we re talking about litter i ll take litter first the litter category is pretty tame right now as far as the promotional environment so if you look at sequentially it was pretty much flattish and even year over year there is no story there so we think it s steady as you go in litter i think you got to keep in mind is that in the litter category these hard fought price increases it s unlikely that the suppliers are going to want to deal that that the hard one increased back to the consumers so i wouldn t expect that to change in 2020 laundry same story i mean q4 was our lowest quarter of the year 25 sold on deal and the category was 35 and liquid laundry little bit higher it was 37 sold on deal but two big suppliers would be church dwight and henkel both down sequentially from q2 pardon me q3 to q4 and procter was up it kind of filled the void in the promotional space we expect that to continue in 2020 okay you re next yeah rupesh parikh oppenheimer co inc analyst okay thank you just on the sorry 3 5 organic growth like and you re exiting that you said is now out of the vitamin so the vitamin business in private label is that going to be i m assuming that growth was more dilutive to your growth or it was actually growing faster so that 3 5 on a more continuing space is like a 4 or is not is small relative to make to move the needle matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer yes i ll take a swing at this and then rick can jump in yes so we call it 3 5 for 2020 our run rate in the second half of 2019 as a company is 4 we ve said hey that s going to accelerate by 50 basis points because of flawless from 4 to 4 5 so we have 100 basis points go in other way for two reasons one exiting private label vitamins and number two we re continuing to pull back on oxiclean promotions now with that 100 basis points the lion s share of that is the vitamin business we have stepped up our innovation over the last couple of years in vitamins if you saw the slide that we had earlier you ll see if you went back to 16 and 17 we had like 6 new launches a year 18 from 19 we had 22 new launches and next we re going to have 17 new launches so but this is the right time to exit our private label it came into the company with the acquisition and it s lower margin and we think it s fine rick dierker executive vice president chief financial officer yes i would just add that business was flattish the private label business for vitamins it wasn t declining or anything like that we just felt that that wasn t the right strategic choice for the company so we decided to proactively get out of it rupesh parikh oppenheimer co inc analyst and that is i think that is accretive to margins if i assuming right on exiting to end that business or that s not rick dierker executive vice president chief financial officer it s when you think about the scale and the size of that business right where if we give you a sense of it if we re saying 100 basis points is going down for those two things maybe two thirds of that is the private label and one third of that is the laundry stuff so any impact on margin is pretty minimal matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer and following up on bill s question if i may on the clean simple is that a margin accretive innovation or in the meantime you might have like what is the price point that you re positioning at this point hey paul do you want to take a swing at the price points paul wood executive vice president us sales yes so the price points this is going to be right in line with our existing lineup so just as britta was talking about the efficacy and it being equal that s how it will show up for shelf as well and that s a really big message that our retailers really resonated with them that it was going to be line priced rick dierker executive vice president chief financial officer and then from a margin basis we wouldn t really say much but it s at brand average year one we have of course cost to drive volume for incrementality matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay joe joe altobello raymond james associates analyst thanks just wanted to get a bit more color on the increase in marketing spend obviously a big in the fourth quarter and it sounds like you re looking for about a 1 point of headwind on eps growth in 2020 what s driving the increase is it bigger new launches and what particular brands is it going behind and are you shifting dollars away from promo into marketing matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer is the question with respect to fourth quarter joe altobello raymond james associates analyst fourth quarter and 2020 as well matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay well fourth quarter we could see what was coming and we are doing well on top line and gross margin so we have a chance to reinvest both in marketing and in sg a we call that all places we invested in sg a so obviously we re able to throw a lot of money behind on the brands that and that always helps you going into the new year as your question about 2020 is the 10 basis points uptick joe altobello raymond james associates analyst yes more so that the 1 point of eps headwind that you re expecting to from launches rick dierker executive vice president chief financial officer the 10 basis points does represent the 1 eps drag and it s really for the new launches right the one on the table we ll really get behind that in a big way the new razor for flawless get behind that in a big way and then maybe britta if you want to talk about britta bomhard executive vice president chief marketing officer yes so we have a couple of exciting product as you saw so for example batiste foam we are category leader and as you ve seen there is a huge household penetration opportunity it s also a new hair type so we re going to spend some money on educating consumers about a new way particularly women with curly and dry hair matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer and maybe one more i had i just thought of is we showed you household penetration for waterpik in the us versus internationally and we found that it s very responsive to advertising and so now we re going to start rolling that out in europe and canada and australia so that marketing investment is happening globally as well joe altobello raymond james associates analyst and just one for steve the increase in operating margin for international this year is pretty big is that coming from sales leverage among other things or cost savings programs what s driving that steven p cugine executive vice president international and gnpi yes so i think there s a couple of things we had some expense in the year that we re not going to recover we feel like we ve made investments on top of that that we re not going to repeat again in next year i would say that s a large part of that and there is some mix as well joe altobello raymond james associates analyst okay thanks matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay steve stephen powers deutsche bank analyst okay i do have a question for steve but something rick said earlier prompted another question why would flawless have any impact on organic regardless of what it does in the first quarter given that you didn t owner it a year ago rick dierker executive vice president chief financial officer it doesn t i was trying to give you a sense that on a reported basis in q1 that it could be flat to down the organic impact is 50 basis points for the full year all of that s in the second half around 100 basis points matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay perfect and then internationally maybe you could get a lot going on but maybe you could rank order the growth initiatives you have on top 3 whether you think about it by brand by geography or by category and then as you think forward with the commitments or margin expansion as an evergreen does that does that inhibit your ability to kind of press on growth as you have been or should we expect some deceleration back down toward that evergreen s six ish level rick dierker executive vice president chief financial officer no we feel really confident i mean we see the business accelerating as you saw in 2019 and we see that continuing into 2020 again with less requirement for investments because we think we have the right kind of staffing level in each one of the regions china was a big investment over the last couple of years as we ve built our own team in china plus we spent money on slotting getting product into that market so we think all of that whether it would be latin america which has been growing very nicely for us and in asia pac whether it would be china or southeast asia we ve made a lot of investments in the past and now we think we can reap the benefits of continued strong organic growth without those investments repeating that s just that s why we feel so confident that we can continue to deliver on the operating margin because we re going to get leverage in the p l so we re going to get that on marketing and we re going to get that on sg a for sure stephen powers deutsche bank analyst it is the growth investment skewed anywhere i mean are you more excited about emerging markets about rick dierker executive vice president chief financial officer you know it s a funny thing and is here he runs our gmg business and he would say this year we had strong growth in emea and in latin america latin america is smaller for us but fast growing we made those investments in china we saw very strong china growth in 2019 and we expect strong growth in southeast asia as well asia in particular we see is real growth engine long term for the company because we re just still young and small but growing fast matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay swing to this side of the table kevin kevin grundy jefferies co analyst perfect kevin grundy of jefferies i had a question on international as well so it works out so connecting the dots just to sort of pick up where you left off there steve given that why the implied deceleration in the outlook for international and i don t want to diminish 7 which is outstanding but you guys haven t done a 7 in the past five years in the region and now you have a presence in china so i m just trying to connect the dots with that and then more broadly maybe matt you can chime in the role in m a and how you potentially see that longer term in growing your international business and the last just like from a capital planning perspective when do certain markets you potentially consider moving them from the export model to the subsidiary model what sort of like a tipping point how do you think about that and implications from a income statement and from balance sheet perspective thanks matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay i ll try to remember all that let s start off with the current year so we have an algorithm of 6 annually so we always go back to that can we sustain 6 year after year after year and if you look at what steve has been doing in international is hitting out of the park and so now we got a big plan for this year you might say you re sad because it s not 9 but we re not a company that s going to get way out over our skus so we think we got a strong plan for 2020 we don t view that as a deceleration we look at that as we re consistently now delivering above our algorithm you asked the question about international so we have done some m a internationally over the past few years viviscal was a is an international brand our waterpik had some international as well we bought the anusol brand from j j and so we re putting a lot of effort behind those and we get a lot of traction so steve and his gang have done a great job taking those international markets so we re continually scanning for things that we can acquire and we can put into our infrastructure and leverage it but we re pretty fussy about what we re going to buy and as you know you had a third one though the third question kevin grundy jefferies co analyst yeah when does it tip to go direct matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer yeah ok i ll go steve can say what we ve done in germany steven p cugine executive vice president international and gnpi yeah so we look at markets where we can go direct and it really is all about sg a leverage so how concentrated is the retail environment and in germany it s quite concentrated so we were able to go direct in germany and manage that p l so we get returns fast my two buddies down here they re pretty disciplined about spending and returns as you can imagine so you really need like a 20 to 1 relationship in terms of sg a investment to sales growth and so where the markets are young and highly fragmented from a retail environment it takes a lot more sg a to make that happen so we know the underlying economic model for us what we need to have to shift from an export market to a subsidiary market and we ll make those calls as we see fit but that is not required for us to hit our evergreen target matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay alright same table jason jason english goldman sachs analyst good afternoon and thank you two very different topics for questions first sticking on international but with a supply chain angle can you update us on the status of tariffs on your supply chain and also whether or not we should be considering any risk related to the coronavirus in terms of supply and manufacturing of whether it d be the waterpik or i m not sure where flawless is manufactured whether we should be cognizant of that as well second is on private label could you size of 100 bps drag how much of it is from the private label exit any reason to think that may actually suck some capacity out of the industry and help your branded side and is there also maybe on the other side of that risk presumably a good time to exit would have been five years ago when you re spending a lot of money to add capacity i imagine you chose not to because of there was a risk tethered to it if assuming that s the case then why is that there no longer that risk matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer i ll start with china so we re well aware of what s going on in china right now with the virus so we have checked with our suppliers of both of finished products and also business like flawless and spinbrush and waterpik and right now it looks like because of the extension of the chinese new year there is going to be a 1 maybe 2 week delay in start up of those manufacturing sites but because of our safety stock what s on the water and also you can overcome some of delay like that with air freight that we don t see a risk right now with what we know right now to quarter call that s in the it s in the release good on that one rick dierker executive vice president chief financial officer yeah and then on tariffs i would i try to talk about in my prepared remarks a little bit but that 1 drag on eps is tariffs that s really the four b list that went into effect on december 15 and we re getting hit on showerheads and flawless so you can do the math on what about 1 eps drag is but it s a couple of cents and then your other question on private label vitamins of 100 basis points decline in organic growth i had said about 60 is piece of the private label vitamin beginning to exit right it s a two year process so 50 bps of the 100 is from private label vitamins and i don t know rick if you want to say anything else about the supply chain in china or are you good rick spann executive vice president global operations yeah matt pretty much covered it we re working very closely with our suppliers and what we know so far is the one to two week delay that matt referenced on starting up after chinese new year we have ample safety stock don t anticipate a material impact to q1 but it s something we ll continue to monitor on a regular basis matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay all right okay you ve been waving your hand for a while stephen powers deutsche bank analyst thanks matt wanted to talk about two different categories and just state of competition in laundry and cat litter and then also your expectations for fiscal 20 between volume versus price mix matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer i couldn t hear the very first part of it stephen powers deutsche bank analyst laundry and cat litter the state of competition matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer oh the state of competition in the laundry and litter category okay well i mean you saw the chart with respect to shares in laundry we had a great year in laundry arm hammer was up xtra for the first time in a longtime held share up a little bit and oxiclean we lost some share but that was as not as expected because we pulled back on promotions you also saw from the chart the dynamics over the last three years but who is winning and who is struggling we think we have an unfair competitive advantage in the laundry detergent because we have a value brand that s advertised which is arm hammer and arm hammer is 1 billion brand if you go across all of our categories and actually we ve done a wonderful job in positioning that product against sun over the last couple of years and we continue to win distribution so we ve got a long term plan and we aim to be the number two supplier of laundry detergent at some point in the litter category litter is a function of innovation and we have been the innovator in that category for many many years and we think that over time that is going to bode well for us as far as growing share in the future i commented earlier about the promotional environment it is pretty much pretty tepid i would say in both categories i don t expect that to change in litter as we said because we re not going to deal back your price increases and i do think that the reduction in the amount sold on deal in the laundry category is really de facto price increase we want list price increases in laundry but the pull back in promotions as a group over time is de facto an increase in price and it improves margins steven p cugine executive vice president international and gnpi and matt if you want me talk about just how we advertise oxi laundry and what s this done to the additives category matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer you can do that steven p cugine executive vice president international and gnpi well sometimes myopically we just look at oxi laundry is down a little bit in share but we really didn t take a broader brush and say since we launched oxiclean laundry we ve gone from a 42 share in additive to 56 share in additives so we re really happy with our oxiclean megabrand matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer i hope everybody paid attention to that so if you go back and say wow you know oxiclean launched into premium laundry detergent and we re sad because it didn t work out no so in stain fighters we had a 42 market share when we launched oxiclean over in liquid laundry it went from 42 to 56 today so all that effort paid off and so we re making a lot more money today so that brand is alive and well britta bomhard executive vice president chief marketing officer can i add something so you see matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer let s pile on here this is good britta bomhard executive vice president chief marketing officer sorry matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer let s pile on britta bomhard executive vice president chief marketing officer yes well i love that brand so i have to talk about brands and i think you ve seen the more power to you and what it does for us we now have a similar and that s work your magic on oxiclean which is equally working extremely well across the different components of oxiclean so if we have several very clear evidence the lifts after we advertise and then it s across the different sub segments of oxiclean as well so i m very confident positive that oxiclean is a very very strong brand and we continue to grow matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer okay all right it looks like we might be done hey i want to thank everybody for coming today we had great questions and looking forward to talking to you at the end of the first quarter duration 79 minutes call participants matthew t farrell chairman president chief executive officer britta bomhard executive vice

very carefully monitoring the situation he said there will clearly be implications at least in the near term for chinese output and i would guess for some of their close neighbors the virus outbreak

good morning i ll make some introductory remarks and focus on some high level themes and initiatives that enhance our strategy positioning us well to continue to generate superior performance mark will then discuss our financial results and john will review our insurance operations in more detail providing additional color on key underwriting and strategic initiatives we re extremely proud of our stand out 2019 fourth quarter and full year results reflecting continued strong execution across our underwriting and investment functions for the quarter we generated record non gaap fully diluted operating earnings per share of 1 37 which translated to an annualized operating roe of 15 2 our combined ratio was an exceptional 91 8 and after tax net investment income was up 6 to 47 million the fourth quarter capped off an overall stellar year for the company in which we generated strong premium growth of 7 and a solid combined ratio of 93 7 with underwriting operations contributing 6 5 points of roe our investment results were excellent with after tax net investment income increasing 13 and contributing 9 1 points of roe for 2019 our overall non gaap operating roe was 13 3 which exceeded our 12 financial target in addition the change in unrealized after tax gains on our available for sale securities of 169 million or 2 83 per share reduced our operating roe by 60 basis points for 2020 these unrealized gains will reduce operating roe by about 100 basis points and that will reverse as these securities age 2019 was a standout year for us in many respects with some of the operational highlights including net premium written growth of 7 versus 6 expected for the industry average delivering our sixth consecutive year of double digit roes which places us among an elite group of peers that have generated similar results issuing 300 million of 30 year senior notes in our first ever institutional debt offering which significantly increases our flexibility and provides access to attractive long term capital markets being recognized for our superior operating and financial performance by rating agency ambest who put a financial strength ratings on positive outlook in october continuing to make progress on strategic initiatives such as geo expansion and delivering a superior omnichannel customer experience making our communities safer through the dissemination of recall notification and alerts coupled with our efforts to reduce distracted driving with our selective drive product offered free of charge to our commercial lines customers receiving recognition as one of america s best midsize employers by forbes and building a solar energy farm at our corporate office which will annually generate approximately 4 million kilowatts of energy highlighting our commitment to our communities and society as a whole starting off 2020 there are a few specific topics i d like to comment on first we re pleased with the direction of industrywide standard commercial lines pricing which continues its upward trajectory and should only increase further in 2020 for selective fourth quarter overall renewal pure pricing reached 3 8 which we expect will clearly establish a pricing floor for 2020 our sophisticated modeling and underwriting tools allow us to administer price increases at an extremely granular level while balancing retention and growth rates we ve been steadfast in our commitment to maintaining underwriting discipline having consistently implemented commercial lines renewal pure price increases that have matched or exceeded loss trends renewal pure price versus expected loss trend is the primary indicator of future underwriting performance for the past five year period our compounded commercial lines renewal pure price was about 16 5 more than twice the towers watson clips pricing of 8 as we look forward to the coming year we are well positioned with expected renewal pure price in line with loss trend and excellent book of business and the sophisticated tools technology and best in class people to execute on our strategic plans second there s been considerable industry focus on the potential for rising loss trend we certainly are keeping a close eye on overall loss trends especially with respect to litigation rates and settlements estimated pure premium or loss costs are broken down into two principal measurements one estimated ultimate claim counts and two expected average severity over the past two years our expectation for overall loss trend which is embedded in our loss picks has increased from approximately 3 to 4 in addition we maintain a very disciplined reserve methodology in position with a process that includes quarterly detail ground up internal actuarial reviews as well as semi annual reviews conducted by an independent big 4 accounting firm we are less susceptible to headline type injury awards as our book of business is focused on smaller account business and lower hazard classes our average commercial lines account size is 12 000 and 87 of our casualty policies excluding workers compensation have limits of 1 million or less we also purchased reinsurance protection that limits per event exposure on casualty policies to 2 million that reduces our exposure to long term medical inflation inflation even social inflation is not a new concept the best way to protect your book s performance is by achieving consistent renewal pure price over time selective has consistently done this over many years third while catastrophe losses were relatively moderate in the fourth quarter of the year the risks of large unexpected losses remains pronounced climate related risks are leading to generally unpredictability of catastrophe events such as hurricanes convective storms floods and wildfires for the year our total catastrophe loss ratio was 3 1 points which was below our expectation of 3 5 points in an effort to limit our exposure our catastrophe reinsurance program protects us on a 0 4 event probability to only a 5 impact on stockholders equity non catastrophe property losses have also been consistently elevated for the past few years as an industry we need to do more to manage property risks appropriately including through mitigation initiatives risk sharing more diligent underwriting and consistent risk based pricing finally the prolonged low interest rate environment will continue to put downward pressure on industrywide investment portfolio returns and consequently roes in the coming year this should result in a greater impetus for the industry to improve underwriting results in order to generate adequate returns with our pricing sophistication and agile execution capabilities we are well positioned to benefit from commercial lines pricing tailwinds and feel very confident in our ability to maintain attractive roes turning to 2020 expectations our guidance for the year is based on our current view of the marketplace and incorporates the following one a gaap combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses of 30 about 91 5 this assumes no prior year development two catastrophe losses of 3 5 points three after tax investment income of 185 million which includes 14 million of after tax investment income from our alternative investments four an overall effective tax rate of approximately 19 5 which includes an effective tax rate of 18 5 for investment income reflecting a tax rate of 5 25 on tax advantaged municipal products and tax rate of 21 for all other items five weighted average shares of 60 5 million on a diluted basis now i will turn the call to mark to review the results for the quarter mark a wilcox executive vice president chief financial officer thank you greg and good morning for the quarter we reported 1 36 of fully diluted earnings per share and 1 37 of non gaap operating earnings per share both of which are company records we generated a very strong annualized roe of 15 1 at a non gaap operating roe of 15 2 for 2019 our annualized non gaap operating roe of 13 3 was above our 12 target the full year operating roe was reduced by about 60 basis points due to the significant after tax net unrealized gains on fixed income portfolio that increased gaap equity by 169 million or 2 83 per share these gains reflect the low interest rate environment each year we establish an operating roe target that is based on at least the 300 basis point spread over our weighted average cost of capital our outlook for interest rates and overall p c insurance market conditions for 2020 we ve established a non gaap operating roe target of 11 the lower target is principally a function of our lower estimated weighted average cost of capital and the lower interest rate environment which has put pressure on investment yields and has also increased gaap equity consolidated net premiums written increased 8 in the quarter with excellent 11 growth in our standard commercial lines segment driven by strong new business growth and retention and accelerating renewal pure price increases this was partially offset by premium declines in personal lines and e s underwriting profitability remained strong with a fourth quarter combined ratio of 91 8 driven by low level of catastrophe losses in our footprint and favorable casualty reserve development on an underlying basis or excluding catastrophe losses and prior year casualty reserve development our combined ratio increased to 93 8 driven by an elevated fourth quarter expense ratio and some modest increases to 2019 accident year loss effects which i ll touch on more in just a minute for 2019 consolidated net premiums written increased 7 with strong contributions from our standard commercial lines and e s segments our reported combined ratio was highly profitable at 93 7 and our underlying combined ratio was an excellent 92 9 which reflects 20 basis points of underlying margin improvement in 2019 despite delivering a very profitable combined ratio in 2019 of 93 7 which was almost 2 full points ahead of our 95 5 in combined ratio forecast going into the year the underlying combined ratio ended the year at 90 basis points above expectations this was in part driven by the excellent calendar year loss ratio that drove the expense ratio up by 30 basis points above expectations due to profit based compensation with the remainder largely driven by some modest fourth quarter adjustments to 2019 casualty loss ratio picks for the year the impact of these additions to 2019 loss ratio picks was 14 5 million or 60 basis points and for the quarter the impact was 11 9 million or 1 8 catastrophe losses which is a reminder related only declines specifically related to catastrophes designated by pcs were modest in the fourth quarter and impacted the combined ratio by 1 point which is better than expected while non cat property losses resulted in a 15 1 point impact and were also slightly lower than expected for the year catastrophe losses accounted for 3 1 points on the combined ratio which was better than our annual expectations of 3 5 points while non cat property losses of 15 8 points came in about 10 basis higher than expected for the year our expectations for catastrophe losses remain unchanged for 2020 at 3 5 points in the fourth quarter we experienced 20 million of net favorable prior year casualty reserve development driven by 35 million of favorable development in workers compensation line and partially offset by 5 million of development in general liability 4 million in commercial auto 4 million in personal auto liability and 2 million in e s segment the impact of net favorable prior year casualty reserve development was 3 points on the combined ratio for the quarter and 2 3 points for the year moving to expenses our expense ratio came in at 34 1 for the quarter and 33 8 for the year the increase of 60 basis points for the year was principally driven by higher profit based compensation for our distribution partners and employees driven by our excellent underwriting results we expect to pay out a record level of agency supplemental commissions for the 2019 year we expect some modest expense ratio improvement in 2020 which is reflected in our underlying 91 5 combined ratio forecast over the next few years we believe we can continue to improve our operational efficiency and drive down our expense ratio while also still making significant investments in developing our people improving our underwriting capabilities enhancing customer experience continued product development and geographic expansion and other investments we feel important to manage the company for the long term corporate expenses which are principally comprised of holding company costs and long term stock compensation totaled 2 6 million in the quarter compared with 3 4 million in the comparative quarter with the decrease principally driven by a decline in our soft price for the year corporate expenses totaled 31 million compared to 25 million in 2018 and included 3 million of one time items principally related to severance turning to investments for the quarter after tax net investment income of 47 million was up 6 from the comparative quarter for the year after tax investment income was up of 181 million was up 13 the improvements at both periods was driven by active portfolio management and excellent cash flows which when combined with the net proceeds from our senior note offering in march helped drive our invested asset base higher this was all partially offset by the lower interest rate environment and a contraction in credit spreads that put pressure on new money purchase yields the overall after tax yield on the fixed income portfolio including high yield bonds averaged 2 9 for the year the average new money yield on the fixed income portfolio during the year was 2 7 after tax although we ve now seen five sequential quarterly declines with the fourth quarter coming in at 2 4 after tax in addition we ve managing down our floating rate securities which now represent approximately 12 of our fixed income portfolio which is down from a peak allocation of 18 despite the decline in libor over the last year we still find the all in yield of these securities very attractive on a comparative basis with similar fixed rate securities all in all the pre tax book yield on our core fixed income portfolio decreased 5 basis points in the quarter and was down 14 basis points for the year on a go forward basis we expect continued pressure on our book yield given the low interest rate environment however given our strong expected cash flow our 2020 after tax net investment income guidance of 185 million reflects the modest growth from 2019 although a lower roe contribution given the growth in stockholders equity our average fixed income credit rating remained strong at aa minus and the effective duration of our fixed income and short term investment portfolio is at the low end of the range at 3 6 years overall we continue to have the portfolio conservatively positioned risk assets which principally include high yield fixed income securities and alternative investments portfolio accounted for 8 of total invested assets as of the end of the year and remain under way our longer term target our alternative investment portfolio which includes limited partnerships in private equity private credit and real asset investment and reports on a one quarter lag generated a pre tax gain of 18 million for the year which was in line with 2018 tuning to capital our balance sheet remained very strong with 2 2 billion of gaap equity an increase of 22 for the year adjusted capital ratio was 20 1 at year end which is well below our target and provides us with financial flexibility we continue to operate at the low end of our premiums to surplus target range of 1 4 times to 1 6 times this flexibility at the operating level when combined with our 278 million of holding company liquidity provides us with meaningful capacity to grow if market opportunities present themselves at our 1 4 times operating leverage each combine ratio point equates to just under 1 point of roe in addition our 3 05 times investment leverage means that each point of pre tax book yield on our investment portfolio results in approximately 2 5 points of roe with regards to our reinsurance program we enjoyed a successful renewal of our catastrophe program on january 1 we maintained our existing structure that keeps 1 in 100 or 1 net probable maximum loss of p l from a major catastrophe risk us hurricane at a very manageable 2 of gaap equity and 1 in 250 nets the amount of 0 4 probability at 5 of gaap equity we also renewed our non footprint catastrophe program that drops our retention from 40 million to 5 million for our five new expansion states as well as our e s states outside of our original 22 state footprint which includes states such as florida texas and california pricing on cat program reflected the loss free status of our account and our continued efforts to generate strong renewal pricing in our property portfolio and continued efforts to diversify our exposure as a reminder our reinsurance program also includes access to loss agreements which limits the impact to us of individual loan losses to 2 million for both property and losses individual occurrences about 2 million are ceded under the effect of the loss agreements with that i will turn the call over to john to discuss our insurance operations john j marchioni president chief operating officer director thanks mark and good morning let me begin with a discussion of full year results of our operations by segment and then provide you with an overview of some of our strategic initiatives our standard commercial line segment which represents approximately 80 of premiums generated 8 net premiums written growth for the year continuing a consistent track record of strong and profitable growth segment generated new business growth of 8 stable retention of of 83 renewal pure price increases of 3 4 and an excellent combined ratio of 92 9 or 93 7 on an underlying base commercial lines renewal pure price increases increased 3 8 in the fourth quarter up sequentially from 3 5 in the third quarter we are happy with the overall direction of market pricing while it is worth noting that the increases so far have been greater for larger accounts and specialty risks than for the small and mid market standard lines accounts that make up the majority of our book we pride ourselves on managing our renewal pricing strategy in a highly granular fashion closely monitoring rate and retention by cohort of expected profitability our analysis uses a point of renewal retention measure that removes policies that canceled prior to expiration as we think that s the best indicator of the effectiveness of our pricing strategy on our highest quality standard commercial lines accounts which represented 49 of our commercial lines premiums we achieved renewal pure rate of 2 1 and point of renewal retention of 91 on the lower quality accounts which represented 11 of premiums we achieved renewal pure rate of 7 8 while retaining 80 at point of renewal our ability to analyze the risk and return characteristics of each renewal policy at an extremely granular level allows us to achieve additional loss ratio improvement through mix of business changes while maximizing overall retention drilling down to the results for the year by commercial line of business our largest line general liability achieved an 89 6 combined ratio which included favorable prior year reserve development totaling 5 million or 0 7 points we will continue to closely monitor this line for frequency and severity trends including litigation rates which have been relatively stable in recent quarters for the year we achieved renewal pure price increases of 2 2 for this line excluding umbrella and expect firming pricing environment heading into 2020 our workers comp line generated a 74 1 combined ratio aided by favorable reserve development totaling 68 million which accounted for 21 8 points on the combined ratio this favorable development related primarily to lower than expected severities for accident years 2017 and prior renewal pure pricing was down 2 8 and we continue to take a cautious approach to underwriting this line as market pricing remains aggressive commercial auto continues to produce disappointing results for us and the overall industry as elevated loss trend consumes earned rate increase our combined ratio for this line was 107 9 while we added 4 million of reserves in both the current and prior accident years loss trends have remained generally in line with expectations price increases averaged 7 5 in 2019 on top of similar price increases in each of the prior two years we ve been actively managing new and renewal portfolios in target business segments and improving rating and classification at an individual account level our commercial property book generated a 93 9 combined ratio or 7 1 point improvement from 2018 lower levels of bulk catastrophe and non catastrophe losses drove the improvement while market pricing has improved loss trends remain elevated and indicate the need for additional rate level our renewal pure price increases averaged 4 excluding in the marine and we are taking steps to address the drivers of the higher loss experience through business mix shifts and safety management efforts our personal lines segment which represented 11 of 2019 premiums reported a 2 decline in net premiums written mostly reflecting the more competitive market conditions in personal auto renewal pure price increases averaged 5 and retention remained solid at 83 new business however was down 21 for the year market competition in personal lines particularly for personal auto has become far more pronounced this year the segment produced a combined ratio of 97 3 or 88 6 on an underlying basis while maintaining adequate profitability remains a core focus we will be doing more in the areas of product customization modeling enhancements and distribution to ensure we are optimizing our position in this segment in personal auto net premiums written declined 1 for the year and the combined ratio was 106 4 results included 6 million of strengthening for prior accident year casualty reserves which added 3 5 points on the combined ratio renewal pure price increases averaged 8 9 for personal auto liability and 3 8 for physical damage while benefit to improved profitability of these price increases are clearly putting pressure on new business with market pricing under pressure and the favorable impact of loss trends diminishing we would expect deteriorating results for the industry in this line and less pricing picks up again the homeowners line reported 2 premium decline relative to a year ago and combined ratio of 96 5 that included 15 5 points of catastrophe losses as the majority of our premium is written on an account basis our competitive positioning in the auto line has hurt our homeowners growth renewal pure price increases averaged 3 for the year our e s segment which represented 9 of total premiums generated 4 net premiums written growth in 2019 the premium decline in the fourth quarter related primarily to our decision to exit the snow removal business which we discussed on last quarter s call the segment generated a 95 9 combined ratio for the year compared to 100 3 in 2018 overall renewal pure price increases averaged 4 over the past few years targeted price increases business mix changes and exiting specific underperforming classes of business have contributed to the improved combined ratio performance in this segment our e s book consists primarily a small account business with a similar risk profile to our standard lines while market pricing is increasing it is more muted for the lower hazard a business we write than for riskier classes that we don t such as large account casualty for coastal property let me now switch to some of our strategic initiatives which continue to drive our strong operating and financial performance we are very proud of our accomplishments in 2019 and focused on the following four objectives as we move through 2020 one using our sophisticated pricing tools to achieve standard commercial lines renewal pure price increases that are in line with expected loss trend two expanding share of wallet with our existing distribution partners and strategically appointing new partners three capitalizing on the investments we ve been making to deliver a superior omni channel customer experience and four identifying and addressing opportunities to enhance operational efficiencies and reduce our expense ratio over time through process redesign and technology enhancements we remain confident in the overall price adequacy and embedded profitability on our book of business we continue to achieve price increases where appropriate targeting accounts on a granular basis that are not meeting our profitability expectations the level of commercial lines renewal pure price increases we are seeing increase during the course of 2019 and 3 8 achieved in the fourth quarter are tracking in line with our expectation for loss trend if industry pricing continues to move higher as we expect we are well positioned to further improve underwriting margins second our superior distribution relationships and sophisticated underwriting tools are clear competitive advantages we will seek to capitalize on them as we execute on our strategy to generate profitable growth in the coming years our stated long term objective is to obtain a 3 commercial lines market share that objective is built around appointing partner relationships that control approximately 25 of their markets and achieving an average share of wallet of 12 across those relationships we have an additional commercial lines premium opportunity over time in excess of 2 7 billion if we hit our long term plans and can do so without having to stretch our underwriting appetite or shift our risk profile during 2019 we appointed 98 new distribution partners bringing the total to approximately 1 350 or 2 300 store fronts third we have made major strides in recent years to enhance the customer experience during 2019 we made a number of enhancements to our self service and digital offerings including a streamlined activation process and live chat option we now have a 360 degree view of our customers that allows us to continue to enhance our proactive communication program as we seek to create more customer value in 2019 we rolled out our new marketing tag line do you legally insure which speaks to our differentiated value proposition for distribution partners and customers investing in and building out technologies that improve our customers experience remains a core focus for us finally while we recognize it is essential to continue investing in the initiatives related to our technology platforms sophisticated underwriting tools and customer experience we re also committed to balancing these goals with an efficient operating structure we ll look at a number of areas to improve efficiencies including workflow and process improvements by better leveraging automation and robotics we expect our 2020 expense ratio to be slightly lower than 2019 as we balance our investment and expense management initiatives we are targeting an expense ratio of closer to 32 by the end of next year and we ll seek further improvements in subsequent years looking to 2020 and beyond we are in extremely strong financial and strategic position and are well positioned to continue generating superior results like we have in recent years we have an attractive book of in force business and have created a differentiated franchise with our distribution partners and customers i d like to close by sincerely thanking greg for his 40 years of service and 20 years of outstanding stewardship as ceo of selective he transformed the company into a truly unique franchise in the industry greg and i have worked in close partnership for much of the past decade we ve put in place a strategy that we believe keeps selective on a path to be a consistent industry leader and generate sustained outperformance in greg s new role as executive chairman i will continue to benefit from his guidance and wisdom as i transition into my new responsibilities now i ll turn the call back over to greg gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer thanks john to wrap up another excellent year by delivering our sixth consecutive year of double digit roes which places us among a very elite group of peers that have generated similar results we have the best teams of employees and distribution partners in the industry at selective we re very proud about what we do as a company by one helping our customers put their lives back together by responding promptly and with empathy after experiencing a loss two making our communities safer by providing tools and technologies to our insurers such as weather preparation guides as well as vehicle food and product recall notifications we are seeking to mitigate the risk of distracted and reckless driving with the offering of selective drive free of charge to our commercial lines customers and three providing financial stability to our customers we are the best positioned in this marketplace with an excellent book of business and the tools technology and best in class people in the industry to execute our plans i could not be happier to pass on the reigns of the company to john who will assume the role of chief executive officer effective tomorrow i have full and complete confidence that he will continue to transform selective into a truly unique company in the marketplace and an industry leader as we mentioned on our last conference call i will stay in the role of executive chairman for one year period with that operator we ll open up to questions thank you operator questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session first question is coming from mike zaremski from credit suisse your line is now open mike zaremski credit suisse analyst hey good morning gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer good morning mike mike zaremski credit suisse analyst first question maybe some just clarification on the combined ratio guidance i ve got a couple of questions so the 91 5 is excluding any reserve changes and catastrophes and if that s correct that compares to the for the 2019 number being 92 9 so which would imply a good deal of improvements or am i incorrect and there s you are baking in some potential for reserve releases in 20 gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer yeah mike let me start with that so now there is no reserve releases there that number has the 2021 the 91 5 is a number with no development in it and one of the things you have to remember there s a certain amount of expense ratio improvement in 20 over 19 the favorable development in 19 generated a lot of profit based compensation to employees and to agents so you get a little bit of a mismatch you see some of the favorable developments rolling through in a line item that you exclude but the incremental expenses incurred in 19 were in the underwriting expense ratio so i just want to make sure you ve got that point and that s about 40 basis points approximately between employee and agents overall and so you have some of that element then when you look at the improvement rolling to 20 the rest of it comes from as i mentioned and john mentioned the renewal price in line with trend and then there s underwriting and claim improvements outside of that that also add to some of the improvement john j marchioni president chief operating officer director and mike this is john let me just add one additional point to the final point that greg made relative to that underwriting mix improvement in particular we cite routinely every quarter the difference by cohort between our best business based on future profitability and what we believe to be the 10 or 11 of our portfolio that we think has a higher expected combined ratio going forward by having a lower retention on that business and a higher retention on that business we expect to produce higher combined or lower combined ratios excuse me that is where we generate mix improvement that will give you loss ratio benefit in addition to the difference between rating trends so just wanted to tie that together with the point greg was making mike zaremski credit suisse analyst okay yeah that s helpful and next i ll you might have said this in the prepared remarks mark but the general liability reserve deficiency sounded kind of minimal do you have the kind of the full year 2019 gl reserve development kind of versus 18 and if you don t have it i can take it offline and also remind me mark was there a was gl part of the true up in the current accident year as well in terms of the basis points you mentioned mark a wilcox executive vice president chief financial officer yeah mike so let me walk you through that we did make some modest adjustments in the fourth quarter related to general liability on the prior accident year it was an increase in the prior year reserves of 5 million but we had reflected some favorable development earlier in the year so for the full year 2019 there s actually 5 million of favorable reserve development on the tl liability line in 2019 and that compares to just under 10 million 9 5 million for the full year 2018 so relatively consistent when you re thinking about prior year reserves in the current accident year specifically related to 2019 we did increase the loss pick for general liability by 2 9 points in the quarter which was 5 million impact we had a very modest benefit earlier in the year so net net when you put it all together for 2019 it was a 3 million increase relatively stable lawsuit was flat so i d just consider that a little bit of fine tuning into new accident year mike zaremski credit suisse analyst okay that s perfect and i lastly john in your prepared remarks i believe you said litigation rates relatively stable past few quarters is that are you referring to the what some other firms have called the attorney representation rates and along those lines when we think about increasing loss cost for the industry and i mean you guys think about it especially in the gl or commercial auto line is the attorney rep rate is that one of the kind of biggest unknowns or risk factors or is it predominantly the severity of the lawsuits or both john j marchioni president chief operating officer director so mike this is john i ll start and i ll try to hit both parts of that question so there is a difference between litigation rates and attorney rep rates and what we referred to in our prepared comments was the relative stability over the last several quarters in our litigation rates and that s for all of our liability lines so litigated file is one that is as the name indicates in litigation those are easy to track and measure and see a change over time our attorney rep rates are going to also include files that are not yet in litigation but they are just are beliefs that there is an attorney representing a client those i will tell you are not as easy for us or anybody else to measure because it s a little bit more of knowledge on the part of the claims adjusted to understand whether or not there is any been any attorney communication those numbers will bounce around a little bit more they re going to be higher than litigation rates obviously many of those will not ultimately result in litigation and i think that leads to an important point that we have stressed on this topic in the past i would say really two fronts on this number one we do some modeling work and provide our adjusters very early in the claim lifecycle on files that have attributes that are more likely to result in litigation down the road what that does is make sure that hey we have the right adjuster on that file but can you make sure that there are early communication with that claimant is going to put them more at ease about how that claim is ultimately going to be resolved and that will in many cases help us avoid a litigated file now that sort of ties into your second point which is litigated files generally speaking and part of it s going to be because of the severity of the injuries claim by the claimant but litigated files are generally going to carry a higher severity than unlitigated files some of that is because of the cost of attorney involvement including your own attorney involvement as the company but part of it is also going to be because you re generally going to have higher damage levels on both the property side and the bodily injury side when there s lawyers involved gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer yeah so mike let me just this is greg so obviously to what you think about loss cost it s frequency times severity we closely monitor frequency activity and generally find that that is the leading indicator in terms of the composite of our breakdown your pure premium claims are coming in so we closely monitor that and between that and the severity that john went over is really what drives the overall loss ratio and the amount of loss mike zaremski credit suisse analyst okay and just lastly to be clear on that by the way your color is always extremely helpful are you seeing a little bit clearly given the i guess the texts were changed a little bit are you seeing a little bit of uplift in loss trend john j marchioni president chief operating officer director mike this is john as greg commented during his prepared comments we have adjusted our view over the last couple of years of future trend expectations which had been running around 3 are now pushing up closer to 4 just under 4 so that is reflective of what we ve seen in our own experience yeah i think this is probably an important point to just stress what we think is also are critical consideration when you think about changing loss trends in the industry which is you really want to start by understanding how you feel about the initial loss picks that company has established for their causality lines and we ve been very transparent about this and very consistent about this in all of our prior accident years in recent memory you will note that we talk about having an embedded assumption for future claims trends and that has always been embedded in our loss pick we ve also stressed the importance of achieving pure rate increases or pure price increases that meet or exceed that expected loss trend which is a great way to think about the strength of the loss picks that sit on every one of those older accident years and i just think that s an important consideration when you think about that changing environment to the extent it does happen and it happens industrywide it will hit the current and also hit the prior accident years but we have had that embedded assumption for claims inflation in our loss picks very consistently mike zaremski credit suisse analyst okay understood and greg all the best in your new role as executive chairman of the board thank you gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer mike thanks operator operator thank you the next question is coming from paul newsome from piper sandler your line is open paul newsome piper sandler analyst hi good morning and again congratulations to john and greg so a little bit of a follow up can we talk about rate versus the claims inflation i think if i read it right your true rate increase levels are a little bit below the 4 and does that mean that you ll be essentially pushing for more rate all things being equal next year to keep us up to the next year your at rate inflation gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer so paul this is greg yeah so that s why when we said that the 3 8 will establish the floor that s what the the fourth quarter we got 3 8 in rate and we view that as the floor going into 2020 so yes paul newsome piper sandler analyst okay and then i d love to hear your thoughts generally speaking on the commercial auto business which obviously has struggled for you and everybody else pretty much it doesn t seem like reunderwriting or at least pure rate is helping that much what are we missing there that you think could be the reason why the industry keeps falling behind gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer yeah i think that s a great question and i ll tell you what i think also in the industry principally was led by way higher frequency counts over expected that s what started it and then i think it also so i think that got misstating in 16 and rolled through various accident years was just underestimation and i think that in part reflected some of the societal issues regarding distracted driving regarding core driving habits regarding a lot of issues with a lot of congestion on the roads unemployment dropping people higher driving less experienced people on the road all of that added and just the general road deterioration i mean i m avoiding puddles all over the place now it seems like but it s just the general deterioration of the infrastructure i think that s added to that and i would tell you that one of the products that we offer the selective drive product specifically earmarked at that we offer that to our customers free of charge it allows them to manage their fleet their maintenance records but not only that it s the most important that it gives the driver a score at the end of the week in terms of how well they re driving which includes when they re on the phone what hard braking hard turning anything so that s a big when you look at the hawthorne effect that s a big additive factor that we can offer to our commercial fleets and then i would say the other part then is this whole issue around severity that worked its way in and so it was two areas that probably took a line that normally ran at about maybe 3 5 to 4 in that neck of the woods from a trend standpoint and pushed it to like 7 and then so everybody was getting rate in the 6 7 rate and that s where everybody was getting more of their commercial lines but that only started recently so all of this build up kind of caught everybody by i think a little bit behind the 8 ball but i would tell you that there is a big improvement combined ratios in commercial auto dropped from like 115 in the 115 area we re looking at 106 pretty much on an accident year basis at a current year basis so we actually feel pretty good about our improvement and when you look at where we re getting rate that s obviously our lead line from our rate and it s just under 8 in terms of renewal and that s pure rate so we feel that we can get ahead of it and we also feel maybe that the frequency counts relative to vehicles has kind of apexed right now paul newsome piper sandler analyst yeah i appreciate the color on the thanks for the answers and good luck in next year gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and the next question is coming from amit kumar from buckingham research your line is open amit kumar buckingham research analyst thanks and good morning i had a few follow ups on the same discussion as well just going back to i guess paul s question on pricing versus loss cost and the margin i think i m oversimplifying this a bit but i would have thought that now would be the time to press on pricing and maybe you can just help me understand that a bit better is it a function of the loss trends in your book the launching of your accounts but i would have thought that maybe the trajectory of pricing over 2020 the slope of the line would have been a tad different john j marchioni president chief operating officer director yeah so amit this is john i ll start so i guess first for us based on the fact that we are achieving our target margins and our focus on commercial lines here for us the conversation is more about price adequacy than it is about price maximization i mean that s what we believe in and that price adequacy is in terms of the overall portfolio and it s also on account by account basis you have seen with that in mind though some sequential improvement and it might appear slight but when you look at where our margins are that slight sequential improvement is a positive indication we don t include in our numbers any exposure any exposure change and i think when you look at what s happening in the industry you are seeing a lot more exposure included in the pricing numbers that are being put out there and while there might be some portion of that price number or exposure change that those act like rate much of it does not so we give you what s probably the most conservative view and insight into pricing let s also remember we don t exclude workers comp from our number and in our view if we were to exclude workers comp we probably should exclude it from our combined ratios as well to make the analysis complete so that s it s still a bit of a drag now that said we do think that and we reacted to it by raising our loss our future loss trend expectation up closer to 4 and that has caused us to view the rate need in our portfolio as a little bit higher and therefore we expect to push that as the year goes on now we are going to still do it on a very targeted basis though this is in our portfolio that doesn t justify a meaningful rate increase won t get one because our view is we re going to do what we can to protect that portfolio the flip side to that is the 10 to 15 of the portfolio that we view as having worse than desired combined ratio future combined ratios is going to be the focus of our effort and we re going to achieve higher rate levels there so i guess that s how i d respond overall in terms of how we think about the pricing environment and the other point i would also reinforce is if you look at the willis towers watson clips survey which we do cite frequently and greg cited earlier and look at it for the small account sub segment you re going to see a much lower number in there and a lot of the price headline is coming out of the specialty and e s areas is coming out of the coastal property and very large property accounts we haven t seen it as much in our core small and middle market lower medium hazard risk space that we re predominantly focused on amit kumar buckingham research analyst that s a fair comment so is it possible and i completely agree and appreciate your comment on exposures so it s simply not apples to apples looking at your numbers versus others but do you have the number excluding workers comp for the quarter or maybe could you even like talk about it sort of in generalities how much the delta would be if we exclude workers comp from the pricing john j marchioni president chief operating officer director yeah so and we gave you some of the pieces and i can t calculate on the slide for you what it would be ex comp we d have to wait it out but so gl excluding umbrella was 3 3 for the quarter commercial auto was 7 8 commercial property was 4 1 and bop for us which is a smaller line was 5 3 and then you ve got workers comp at a minus 2 7 so you re probably looking at something probably closer to 5 roughly if you were to look at an ex comp number maybe a little bit above 5 on an ex comp basis amit kumar buckingham research analyst got it and that s what i thought okay that s good the other question is also a follow up on the litigation trends and we ve talked about this on several conference calls and we expect to talk about this i know in the past we ve talked about reviver this question is not on reviver can you when you sort of look at your trend line on the litigation trends and then you look at all the reports out there we should look at litigation trends etc when you look at your own book do you think the reason why we haven t seen that level of increased activity versus some of the larger companies is it more because of the account size is it the geographical mix or maybe it s a combination of all of it but maybe just talk about that a little more so that we can get some confidence that these trends will remain stable versus some of the other larger companies thanks john j marchioni president chief operating officer director yeah so i think there clearly are differences and you would expect differences in terms of where the plaintiffs bar is going to target in terms of individual companies and the type of company we do right is going to be less of a target but i think we do look at inflationary trends or claims inflation as not just entirely focused on the headline litigation or headline settlements amount that you see to the extent it s happening it will ultimately start to make its way up and down the marketplace i don t think there is a geographic difference when you look at our footprint our footprint is concentrated in the eastern half of the us with some of the southwest expansion but for us you also want to look at the hazard levels and we do still right a predominantly low and medium hazard class of business with a low limits profile and i know a lot of companies cite their limits profile and ours is certainly on the lower end for most and that will provide some protection if in fact we do see an acceleration of claims i ll also say that while our own litigation rates haven t really moved as we ve mentioned and we focus in terms of our view of our reserves on our own experience we certainly pay attention to what s being stated and what others are saying in the broader industry and have a keen eye on that relative to what might potentially emerge but to sit here and say with clarity that frequency or severity trends are going to be x or y in future years is just tough to get comfortable with amit kumar buckingham research analyst got it the last question i have is on the gl development i think you were responding to mike and i ll go back and look at the transcript but my understanding was there was adverse of 5 million and did you was that from ay 2018 17 i didn t get the details in terms of the moving parts of that 5 million thanks mark a wilcox executive vice president chief financial officer yeah amit it s mark it was 5 million of adverse development in the quarter but i think it s best to look at the full year which was 5 million of favorable development in the general liability lines so there s obviously always some quarterly volatility it s a relatively small number on a big book of business this reflected a little bit of fine tuning in some respects is going into the new year and then as it related to the current accident year and i mentioned this earlier but just for the sake of clarification it was also 5 million on the 2019 accident year so we had a modest benefit earlier in the year so for the full year it was 3 million so if you net the 3 million in the 5 million it s a bit of a wash against the current and the prior related to gl line it reflects a line of business that we ve had reasonably stable trends amit kumar buckingham research analyst got it and then then was that related to like an account or is that just more fine tuning across the book john j marchioni president chief operating officer director it s more across the book and when you think about that small dollar number across multiple of prior accident years there s not even going to be an individual year you would look at but i would say it would definitely have been more in the more recent accident year 17 18 amit kumar buckingham research analyst got it that s all i have thanks for the answers and good luck in your new roles greg and john thanks gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer thank you john j marchioni president chief operating officer director thank you gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer operator next question operator thank you the next question is coming from mark dwelle from rbc capital markets your line is now open mark dwelle rbc capital markets analyst yeah good morning let me just start by giving my well wishes to greg i ve very much appreciated you valuable insights and you will always be among the ivy league of ceos in my book so good luck to you going forward gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer thank you thank you mark mark dwelle rbc capital markets analyst the first question just something fairly simple the corporate expense line item is much lower than the other quarters i think this was the same as a year ago just is there something is there a credit or some seasonality or something i would have thought the comp expense alone would have been more than 2 6 million in a quarter mark a wilcox executive vice president chief financial officer yeah mark it s mark wilcox and let me jump in and greg and john can follow on as well the corporate expense line item it does have an element of volatility and a little bit of seasonality to it so it was running in the 35 million range a few years back it was 25 million now it s again 31 this year it mainly include it s not all but mainly includes stock based compensation and a portion of that call it 25 is what we call liability based and so the recent volatility it is driven really by a couple of factors one there s a peer group factor and two there s also a total shareholder return back and the reason it was down in the quarter was as you re all well aware in q4 and that drove a benefit or credit in that line item in the quarter just as a reminder as you look ahead to 2020 there is some seasonality typically see a heavier front end load in q1 of the new year related to the corporate expense line item given the retirement eligibility and the full expensing of stock based compensation for those individuals that are retirement eligible and receive an award gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer and i would say just the changes that we made to the plan overall now that you have all the years that are now eligible to be expensed in theory that three year period under the new plan it will reduce the overall amount of volatility in the line mark dwelle rbc capital markets analyst okay that s that s helpful thanks second question john you had provided some pretty good pricing segmentation information with respect to the commercial lines book do you have similar information you can share related to the e s book john j marchioni president chief operating officer director well we haven t traditionally i can tell you that we do a similar segmentation but it s more based on industry classification and our targets our target pricing levels to achieve our target roe we do certainly manage it that way internally it s just not something we ve reported about externally but it s the same very granular approach that we take in managing both new and renewal business in the e s segment mark dwelle rbc capital markets analyst okay staying on the e s book any additional insight you can share related to the reserve addition in that business i mean i know it s kind of gone back and forth over the years but is there anything different about loss trend or litigation or anything there gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer mark it s so small it s not even that large so i would say it s just minor year end adjustments that come through based on slight modifications it s not material really its not significant overall mark a wilcox executive vice president chief financial officer yeah it was 2 million in the current quarter on the prior accident year and 2 million in the current quarter on the current accident year but it s relatively modest again a little bit of fine tuning going as we roll over into new accident year they can show we feel confident in our reserve inventory but nothing i think we d point to trends i think the good news obviously with the e s segment as john highlighted is a strong level of profitability it s best year yet from a profitability perspective in the e s still some work to be done to drive toward the target level of risk adjusted debt profitability in e s but the reserve last year we had a 12 million addition so trending in the right direction and to some fourth quarter minor adjustments gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer yeah i would just add to that mark i mean we ve come a long way us about target surcharges that john i think we track that i mean it could tell you exactly where the new renewal is and we are been in this market we ve for the past several years i have never been totally satisfied with what we have been getting or the amount of increases that we re getting on the renewal side we have seen change in that we have done a lot of work on our renewal inventory to get them closer and closer to where our target surcharges need to be and we have been very happy relative to the new business that we put on the books and where that is relative to target surcharge so that s come a long way and again you know us we put in a lot of discipline in it and we want to make sure that that business is profitable we ve always told you that it will the top line will go up or down more based on market conditions and that i think will happen overtime mark dwelle rbc capital markets analyst okay that s helpful and then one last question and this is i suppose it s more of almost a thought question as anything else but i m trying to gauge the kind of the sense of where the market tone is or the from the customers perspective as you go to customers with renewal rate increase requests whatever level they happen to be 5 2 8 whatever i mean what kind of push back are you getting i mean are people understanding of the need for rate is it more than unusually adversarial how does that conversation go at this stage john j marchioni president chief operating officer director yes mark it s john so obviously the answer is going to be it depends it depends on the size of the rate increase and it depends on the individual producer who owns that relationship at our independent agency and their approach to managing that process i will say for us we have really prided ourselves on maintaining that routine balance between price and trend over a long period of time so we re not in a situation where you ve got a 10 or 15 rate under overall portfolio so that minimizes the impact overall when you think about what we re asking of our agents in terms of selling increases now that said we do have very specific discussions and expect our agency partners to be able to have that specific discussion with that smaller percentage of the inventory that is going to get a higher than average increase based on risk characteristics or experience of that account and i will say that based on our overall retention and our retention by cohorts the customers understand that and our distribution partners do a good job of explaining that so i don t necessarily feel like that s a huge impediment at this point executing on our pricing strategy but i will say if we just took an across the board approach and we re trying to fix a loss ratio problem which we re not it would be a lot harder to execute in this kind of an environment because there are enough companies like we are that are well positioned with their pricing sophistication to go out and take those opportunities that look attractive when a company is taking an across the board rate increase gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer and mark this is greg so the other side to that too it really comes down to more than the general economic conditions so with gdp growing businesses growing top line revenue growing price increases are a little bit easier to take in as a customer versus years ago when gdp was not growing and you re trying to raise rate and everybody s looking through their balance sheet looking through their p l to figure out what expense lines they can cut does make it a little bit easier relative to that and the other point that john made earlier relative to what we re doing in customer experience relative to everything that we re doing to build more customer connectivity whether it s our security mentor product that we recently rolled out or drive product the product recalls that we re offering all of the additional work that we do to build more and more contactability to the end customer we want to make sure that when we do need to sell a larger price increase someone would sit there and say ok this is all the value that i m getting from selective and it s not just the insurance policy it s way more than that and we believe that over time that should help our retention help our net promoter scores help all of our osat scores and everything else that we track internally that will make it make a different long term mark dwelle rbc capital markets analyst well thanks very much for that i appreciate the additional insight thanks operator thank you and the next question is coming from matt carletti from jmp your line is now open matt carletti jmp analyst all right thanks just have a quick one i wanted to ask a question on workers comp growth was up 5 in the quarter that s the strongest number we ve seen in a while actually first positive we ve seen in a while just wanted to ask what s going on there i mean i think you gave us the rates so we know it s not that is it good new business production underlying kind of economic work activity was there some audit premium to catch up just what kind of gave us that growth in the quarter john j marchioni president chief operating officer director yeah matt this is john i would say and again remember we write predominantly account business and very little monoline workers comp so you want to think about workers comp growth in the overall context of the very strong quarter we had in commercial lines commercial lines growth was at 11 and that was driven by both strong retention and a solid new business quarter and i would say when you look at the growth in comp relative to the other lines it s still the lowest growth line at that percent but stronger in the quarter certainly i wouldn t necessarily as you said pricing wasn t that materially different than what we saw in the first three quarters i just think we had a stronger growth quarter overall and that helped a little bit the growth in the workers comp segment we have not seen meaningful change in the competitive landscape in comp i will tell you that continues to be especially for small lower hazard workers comp probably the most aggressive market in any segment that we play in you ve seen a lot of companies continue to be very aggressive and we love our results we love our book of business we feel good about the book of business we have but we also recognize that loss trends in that line can continue the downward trajectory they ve been on for both frequency and severity and we re just being cautious about growing that relative to the overall growth of the commercial lines operation matt carletti jmp analyst got you just to kind of tie in that last comment there together i mean am i right to infer that as you go through the component pieces of obviously you gave us guidance that implies kind of accident year margin improvement 20 versus 19 for the overall book that this might be a component where it might tweak the other way a little bit that rates down a few percent and i mean unless trend continues in that direction in which it sounds like it s not an assumption that you d make off the bat that that might be a component that goes a little bit the other way as we go forward john j marchioni president chief operating officer director we give you overall combined ratio guidance and we will give it to you by line but based on how we talk about rate and trends i think the way you described our view of comp would be a fairly accurate description matt carletti jmp analyst great well greg and john congrats and best of luck going forward john j marchioni president chief operating officer director thanks matt gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and the next question is coming from ron bobman from capital returns your line is open ron bobman capital returns analyst hi thanks a lot and greg you ve been awesome i sure have learned a lot and you ve always pointed us in the smart direction so thanks a ton gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer thank you ron bobman capital returns analyst greg a little while ago in the call you mentioned the commercial auto combined was at 115 and now it s at 106 but i m wondering what sort of date or what window or what quarter or what year you were sort of referencing that if i have those numbers right the movement occurred over gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer yeah so let me just pull that out in a second hold on a second let me just spread the lines here so all right so year to date commercial auto in 18 the cap the combined ratio call 116 was the calendar year trend and the accident year was 1 08 pretty close to that in the underlying combined ratio for that year and now we re running call it for this 2019 year commercial auto the combined ratio was a 1 08 and the underlying combined ratio was like a 107 in that neck of the wood so that gives you a little bit of idea as to the movement and what was happening and that s what i was referring to earlier ron bobman capital returns analyst got you and given how rates have been should i think that q4 19 numbers are marginally better than the 108 and 107 that was booked for the whole year or the rate increase has been pretty consistent gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer yeah ron i think the way we build our plan is let s put it this way the way our planning process works the base year is a four year average and then we re projecting that forward so we look at any liability line we re estimating break it down ultimately through a frequency severity number amount and then that ratio is pretty is consistent in liability throughout the year we re not market weighting or price adjusting quarter to quarter so generally speaking on any liability line you ll see unless we re making modifications to it it would be the same ratio every quarter what you do see as volatility in commercial auto though could be the property side and that could be weather specific so that could come from property whether it comes from property damage frequency on the liability side but it also could come through physical damage on that side and that s what could create a little bit more up and down on that number versus a straight liability line like gl or workers compensation where you d see virtually the same kind of ratio throughout the quarters ron bobman capital returns analyst okay thanks you ve mentioned i think just qualitatively but i could have missed it retention i m curious to know how commercial lines retention was in q4 as compared to q3 sequentially please john j marchioni president chief operating officer director yes so retention for our commercial lines was 84 in the quarter and i d give you the full year number which was 83 i don t have the individual first three quarters but that would suggest that it was relatively gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer relatively stable a year ago in q4 18 it was a little bit lower at 83 and then throughout the year it was 84 83 84 84 and the full year at 83 so relatively stable retention throughout the year ron bobman capital returns analyst got you that s great elasticity as far as that supporting you to push more rate i guess or like you said a baseline i think is what greg said going into 2020 gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer thank you for picking up on that ron bobman capital returns analyst last question putting aside selective s and you highlighted really small e s book as compared to your admitted book from a more general perspective this challenge of increased loss cost a portion of which is driven by attorney representation and the distinction between that and litigated claims do you think that an e s book would be more resilient to that challenge than an admitted book or it s both are going to sort of face the same delta from loss cost inflation being driven by litigation or attorney representation in one form or another john j marchioni president chief operating officer director yeah ron this is john i would say generally speaking i don t think it s going to be that different but it also depends on the segment of the e s market we re talking about i do think if you re writing in the space of the e s market that is really high exposure products higher hazard classes of business you might see a little bit more of an acceleration in terms of claims trends but i would say for us our book is predominantly small contractors small habitational small restaurants and mercantile and service businesses small limits profile not high profile exposures it would be more akin to what we would expect to see in our standard lines book mark a wilcox executive vice president chief financial officer yes and i think greg quoted a number earlier on that limits profile casualty within stated commercial lines 1 million or less 87 of the book and an e s for casualty for the 1 million and below is 98 so a very similar limits profile even perhaps a little bit more conservative gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer and again everybody focuses on the issues that could raise loss cost we do as well and i just want to make sure we get out there is a tremendous amount of effort internally in the organization john touched on the litigation propensity models the escalation models that we have what we re doing in the area of complex claims some of the other work that i know we re starting on relative to robotics in certain areas what we re also doing to find out when we look at losses and sit there and say what is it that we can do to help mitigate some of the losses whether it s notification whether it s education and we ve got a lot of efforts on that and those are things that will pay off on the longer term and normally would not we re not going to see any credit come through in the near term relative to the loss ratios but they are a part of analyzing the loss costs analyzing how you get back to strength analyzing how and some of the things you can do in ensure tech to help mitigate that are all things that we need to be focused on to reduce loss costs so those efforts are under way but will pay off over time ron bobman capital returns analyst thanks and greg thanks for time again you ve been great and you re leaving us i think well protected and well led with john take care gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer i hear you ron operator thank you and we show no further questions in queue at this time gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer all

gold is extending its gains and that bodes well for the industry s largest players the gold sector is finally showing signs of life after a multi year slide that put most of the gold miners off the radar of canadian investors gold resurgence the price of gold currently trades at us 1 590 per ounce compared to its 12 month low around us 1 270 gold briefly topped us 1 600 earlier this month and could potentially break through that level again and take a run at new six year highs in the coming weeks pundits are even speculating the 2011 highs above us 1 900 could be within reach in 2020 given the numerous financial and geopolitical risks that are driving gold demand recent support is fuelled by fears connected to the coronavirus outbreak in china this is along with tensions in the middle east the china u s trade war brexit and a global trend toward negative rates on government debt global financial markets are reacting to the potential impact of the coronavirus on economic activity the longer the virus disrupts trade and consumer and business spending the more likely countries will begin to reduce economic growth targets as a result investors are starting to move funds out of higher risk positions and into safe haven assets the oil market is already pricing in reduced demand for example wti oil is trading at us 51 50 per barrel compared to more than 63 earlier in january and is approaching a 12 month low cash is also flowing into government bonds and driving down yields the u s 10 year treasury yield is at 1 53 compared to 1 91 a month ago it too is approaching its lowest point in the past year in this environment it isn t a surprise to see gold catching a bid the yellow metal is widely viewed as a safe place to protect wealth this is particularly true for investors who hold the bulk of their money in currencies other than the u s dollar gold is priced in the american currency and there is a risk that central banks around the world will ramp up interest rate cuts to try to boost their domestic economies this can lead to a global race to devalue currencies which can erode wealth and undermine purchasing power in the international markets holding gold is one way to protect against a devaluation of a currency against the dollar should you buy barrick gold the medium term outlook for gold is positive given the basket of concerns hitting markets the gold miners tend to move more than the price of gold so it would make sense for investors who are bullish on gold to consider adding gold stocks to their portfolios barrick gold tsx abx nyse gold is up about 50 since the end of may last year but more gains should be on the way the company s ceo recently said that barrick could effectively wipe out its net debt by the end of 2020 if gold holds its gains that would be a huge milestone for a company that was on the brink just a few years ago with debt of us 13 billion barrick raised its dividend late last year and the elimination of the debt burden would free up cash to boost the payout the company currently owns five of the top 10 mines on the planet and had 2019 gold production of 5 5 million ounces barrick is also a major copper producer and copper could see a sharp price rise in the coming years as the trend to renewable energy picks up pace wind turbines and solar panels use significant amounts of copper barrick gold trades at just 24 50 per share it wouldn t be a surprise to see the stock top 30 by the end of the year
earlier this week the federal reserve decided to keep interest rates steady at its ultra low target range of 1 5 to 1 75 percent mainstream policymakers and economists mostly agree this is necessary but it would probably go too far to say they re happy about it low interest rates come with perceived trade offs more risk of financial bubbles harms to savers and more there s also the instinctive sense that low interest rates in a time of 3 5 percent unemployment are just wrong but if current interest rate policy is both necessary and disturbing that suggests a policy tool that is ill fit to its purposes that central banks adjust interest rates up and down to balance the economy lowering interest rates to boost growth and hiking them to cool off inflation is now so commonplace that it s often treated as an inevitable part of the natural order it s not though it s a policy setup produced by a long line of ideological and political decisions we could in fact use a completely different policy toolkit to balance the various trade offs in the economy so why don t we let s back up for a moment right now inflation in the u s is remarkably low as a practical matter that s the justification for keeping interest rates low as long as prices remain stable why not leave credit cheap and allow jobs to keep growing and wages to keep rising but there s also the worry about financial bubbles that higher interest rates discourage risk taking by investors while lower rates encourage it thus even if inflation is low maybe we should hike interest rates anyway in order to ward off the possibility of another 2001 or 2008 style bubble and burst subscribe to the week escape your echo chamber get the facts behind the news plus analysis from multiple perspectives subscribe

a weekly good news newsletter get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox sign up the problem is that interest rates are an extremely blunt weapon that cause a lot of collateral damage by constraining credit higher interest rates force businesses to either stop growing and hiring or they force them to fail and lay a bunch of people off unemployment either stops falling or actually increases and wages stop rising that in everyday language is how higher interest rates cool off inflation that s a pretty high price to pay to keep prices stable never mind to prevent the occasional financial bubble when the fed hiked interest rates to 17 percent or more to kill the 1970s inflation crisis it set off a brutal recession that did massive still unresolved damage to americans wages and livelihoods the fed has never tried anything equally aggressive to ward off asset bubbles but preventing the 2008 housing bubble would probably have taken interest rates of 10 percent or higher that s probably why current fed officials have largely avoided hiking interest rates in the name of financial stability even though the worry keeps bubbling up in their conversations as a result some fed officials are broaching the possibility of using tools other than interest rates to prevent bubbles in a speech late last year for instance fed governor lael brainard suggested that macroprudential tools other than interest rates be used to temper the financial cycle in plain english brainard was suggesting the fed use more elaborate financial regulations rather than higher interest rates to prevent asset bubbles the financial times noted there are a lot of options to choose from fed officials could raise the capital requirements banks have to meet or even raise the requirements for certain specific activities and those requirements could be raised or lowered with the business cycle the fed could also impose tighter and more exacting regulations on what sorts of loans can be offered when by tightening rules around debt to income ratios for borrowers and other restrictions in fact a similar alternative applies to managing inflation itself if the u s government ever decided that throwing people out of work was too high a cost it could leave interest rates low and use regulations to manage prices instead in fact this is precisely what the government did during world war ii when our war effort spending massively overheated the economy granted the primary point there was to defeat nazism but a positive offshoot of the war effort was an eye poppingly low unemployment rate of 1 5 percent to keep inflation in check the government relied on an elaborate system of price controls plus specific rules about what sort of loans banks could offer when and to what purposes at this point you ve probably noticed a theme here when it comes to both asset bubbles and inflation if we don t use the fed s control of interest rates to manage them the alternative is much more aggressive central planning by the government high interest rates constrain the aggregate supply of credit while allowing private banks and businesses to decide how to distribute that supply so if the government doesn t constrain credit at the aggregate level it needs to give banks and businesses across the economy much more detailed orders about what they can do with all that credit how to manage their business decisions and prices and balance sheets for mainstream economists and lawmakers that s really the key thing interest rates may be a broadsword rather than a scalpel and one that leads to perpetually excessive unemployment but that s the price we have to pay to protect the free market system they just rarely state the trade off in such blunt terms usually burying it under lots of jargon greg mankiw a center right economist was unusually honest in a recent debate when he admitted that the current policy approach keeps employment perpetually below where it could be getting the government involved in price setting might improve the allocation of resources from the standpoint of simple theory he wrote but the complexity of the economy and the history of price controls suggest that this solution is not practical agree or disagree with mankiw s assessment of history this is at least an unusually clear statement of the trade off the funny thing that happened recently is that the mainstream policy approach has finally done so much long term damage to americans livelihoods that it s become impossible for the fed to justify higher interest rates even on the mainstream s pinched terms faced with that new reality many of our officials may have to start rethinking their aversion to central planning whether they want to or not of course if ordinary workers knew that we ve basically been sacrificing their jobs and wages to maintain our ideological devotion to the free market they might have demanded a rethink a long time ago

91 8 and after tax net investment income was up 6 to 47 million the fourth quarter capped off an overall stellar year for the company in which we generated strong premium growth of 7 and a solid combined ratio of 93 7 with underwriting operations contributing 6 5 points of roe our investment results were excellent with after tax net investment income increasing 13 and contributing 9 1 points of roe for 2019 our overall non gaap operating roe was 13 3 which exceeded our 12 financial target in addition the change in unrealized after tax gains on our available for sale securities of 169 million or 2 83 per share reduced our operating roe by 60 basis points for 2020 these unrealized gains will reduce operating roe by about 100 basis points and that will reverse as these securities age 2019 was a standout year for us in many respects with some of the operational highlights including net premium written growth of 7 versus 6 expected for the industry average delivering our sixth consecutive year of double digit roes which places us among an elite group of peers that have generated similar results issuing 300 million of 30 year senior notes in our first ever institutional debt offering which significantly increases our flexibility and provides access to attractive long term capital markets being recognized for our superior operating and financial performance by rating agency ambest who put a financial strength ratings on positive outlook in october continuing to make progress on strategic initiatives such as geo expansion and delivering a superior omnichannel customer experience making our communities safer through the dissemination of recall notification and alerts coupled with our efforts to reduce distracted driving with our selective drive product offered free of charge to our commercial lines customers receiving recognition as one of america s best midsize employers by forbes and building a solar energy farm at our corporate office which will annually generate approximately 4 million kilowatts of energy highlighting our commitment to our communities and society as a whole starting off 2020 there are a few specific topics i d like to comment on first we re pleased with the direction of industrywide standard commercial lines pricing which continues its upward trajectory and should only increase further in 2020 for selective fourth quarter overall renewal pure pricing reached 3 8 which we expect will clearly establish a pricing floor for 2020 our sophisticated modeling and underwriting tools allow us to administer price increases at an extremely granular level while balancing retention and growth rates we ve been steadfast in our commitment to maintaining underwriting discipline having consistently implemented commercial lines renewal pure price increases that have matched or exceeded loss trends renewal pure price versus expected loss trend is the primary indicator of future underwriting performance for the past five year period our compounded commercial lines renewal pure price was about 16 5 more than twice the towers watson clips pricing of 8 as we look forward to the coming year we are well positioned with expected renewal pure price in line with loss trend and excellent book of business and the sophisticated tools technology and best in class people to execute on our strategic plans second there s been considerable industry focus on the potential for rising loss trend we certainly are keeping a close eye on overall loss trends especially with respect to litigation rates and settlements estimated pure premium or loss costs are broken down into two principal measurements one estimated ultimate claim counts and two expected average severity over the past two years our expectation for overall loss trend which is embedded in our loss picks has increased from approximately 3 to 4 in addition we maintain a very disciplined reserve methodology in position with a process that includes quarterly detail ground up internal actuarial reviews as well as semi annual reviews conducted by an independent big 4 accounting firm we are less susceptible to headline type injury awards as our book of business is focused on smaller account business and lower hazard classes our average commercial lines account size is 12 000 and 87 of our casualty policies excluding workers compensation have limits of 1 million or less we also purchased reinsurance protection that limits per event exposure on casualty policies to 2 million that reduces our exposure to long term medical inflation inflation even social inflation is not a new concept the best way to protect your book s performance is by achieving consistent renewal pure price over time selective has consistently done this over many years third while catastrophe losses were relatively moderate in the fourth quarter of the year the risks of large unexpected losses remains pronounced climate related risks are leading to generally unpredictability of catastrophe events such as hurricanes convective storms floods and wildfires for the year our total catastrophe loss ratio was 3 1 points which was below our expectation of 3 5 points in an effort to limit our exposure our catastrophe reinsurance program protects us on a 0 4 event probability to only a 5 impact on stockholders equity non catastrophe property losses have also been consistently elevated for the past few years as an industry we need to do more to manage property risks appropriately including through mitigation initiatives risk sharing more diligent underwriting and consistent risk based pricing finally the prolonged low interest rate environment will continue to put downward pressure on industrywide investment portfolio returns and consequently roes in the coming year this should result in a greater impetus for the industry to improve underwriting results in order to generate adequate returns with our pricing sophistication and agile execution capabilities we are well positioned to benefit from commercial lines pricing tailwinds and feel very confident in our ability to maintain attractive roes turning to 2020 expectations our guidance for the year is based on our current view of the marketplace and incorporates the following one a gaap combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses of 30 about 91 5 this assumes no prior year development two catastrophe losses of 3 5 points three after tax investment income of 185 million which includes 14 million of after tax investment income from our alternative investments four an overall effective tax rate of approximately 19 5 which includes an effective tax rate of 18 5 for investment income reflecting a tax rate of 5 25 on tax advantaged municipal products and tax rate of 21 for all other items five weighted average shares of 60 5 million on a diluted basis now i will turn the call to mark to review the results for the quarter mark a wilcox executive vice president chief financial officer thank you greg and good morning for the quarter we reported 1 36 of fully diluted earnings per share and 1 37 of non gaap operating earnings per share both of which are company records we generated a very strong annualized roe of 15 1 at a non gaap operating roe of 15 2 for 2019 our annualized non gaap operating roe of 13 3 was above our 12 target the full year operating roe was reduced by about 60 basis points due to the significant after tax net unrealized gains on fixed income portfolio that increased gaap equity by 169 million or 2 83 per share these gains reflect the low interest rate environment each year we establish an operating roe target that is based on at least the 300 basis point spread over our weighted average cost of capital our outlook for interest rates and overall p c insurance market conditions for 2020 we ve established a non gaap operating roe target of 11 the lower target is principally a function of our lower estimated weighted average cost of capital and the lower interest rate environment which has put pressure on investment yields and has also increased gaap equity consolidated net premiums written increased 8 in the quarter with excellent 11 growth in our standard commercial lines segment driven by strong new business growth and retention and accelerating renewal pure price increases this was partially offset by premium declines in personal lines and e s underwriting profitability remained strong with a fourth quarter combined ratio of 91 8 driven by low level of catastrophe losses in our footprint and favorable casualty reserve development on an underlying basis or excluding catastrophe losses and prior year casualty reserve development our combined ratio increased to 93 8 driven by an elevated fourth quarter expense ratio and some modest increases to 2019 accident year loss effects which i ll touch on more in just a minute for 2019 consolidated net premiums written increased 7 with strong contributions from our standard commercial lines and e s segments our reported combined ratio was highly profitable at 93 7 and our underlying combined ratio was an excellent 92 9 which reflects 20 basis points of underlying margin improvement in 2019 despite delivering a very profitable combined ratio in 2019 of 93 7 which was almost 2 full points ahead of our 95 5 in combined ratio forecast going into the year the underlying combined ratio ended the year at 90 basis points above expectations this was in part driven by the excellent calendar year loss ratio that drove the expense ratio up by 30 basis points above expectations due to profit based compensation with the remainder largely driven by some modest fourth quarter adjustments to 2019 casualty loss ratio picks for the year the impact of these additions to 2019 loss ratio picks was 14 5 million or 60 basis points and for the quarter the impact was 11 9 million or 1 8 catastrophe losses which is a reminder related only declines specifically related to catastrophes designated by pcs were modest in the fourth quarter and impacted the combined ratio by 1 point which is better than expected while non cat property losses resulted in a 15 1 point impact and were also slightly lower than expected for the year catastrophe losses accounted for 3 1 points on the combined ratio which was better than our annual expectations of 3 5 points while non cat property losses of 15 8 points came in about 10 basis higher than expected for the year our expectations for catastrophe losses remain unchanged for 2020 at 3 5 points in the fourth quarter we experienced 20 million of net favorable prior year casualty reserve development driven by 35 million of favorable development in workers compensation line and partially offset by 5 million of development in general liability 4 million in commercial auto 4 million in personal auto liability and 2 million in e s segment the impact of net favorable prior year casualty reserve development was 3 points on the combined ratio for the quarter and 2 3 points for the year moving to expenses our expense ratio came in at 34 1 for the quarter and 33 8 for the year the increase of 60 basis points for the year was principally driven by higher profit based compensation for our distribution partners and employees driven by our excellent underwriting results we expect to pay out a record level of agency supplemental commissions for the 2019 year we expect some modest expense ratio improvement in 2020 which is reflected in our underlying 91 5 combined ratio forecast over the next few years we believe we can continue to improve our operational efficiency and drive down our expense ratio while also still making significant investments in developing our people improving our underwriting capabilities enhancing customer experience continued product development and geographic expansion and other investments we feel important to manage the company for the long term corporate expenses which are principally comprised of holding company costs and long term stock compensation totaled 2 6 million in the quarter compared with 3 4 million in the comparative quarter with the decrease principally driven by a decline in our soft price for the year corporate expenses totaled 31 million compared to 25 million in 2018 and included 3 million of one time items principally related to severance turning to investments for the quarter after tax net investment income of 47 million was up 6 from the comparative quarter for the year after tax investment income was up of 181 million was up 13 the improvements at both periods was driven by active portfolio management and excellent cash flows which when combined with the net proceeds from our senior note offering in march helped drive our invested asset base higher this was all partially offset by the lower interest rate environment and a contraction in credit spreads that put pressure on new money purchase yields the overall after tax yield on the fixed income portfolio including high yield bonds averaged 2 9 for the year the average new money yield on the fixed income portfolio during the year was 2 7 after tax although we ve now seen five sequential quarterly declines with the fourth quarter coming in at 2 4 after tax in addition we ve managing down our floating rate securities which now represent approximately 12 of our fixed income portfolio which is down from a peak allocation of 18 despite the decline in libor over the last year we still find the all in yield of these securities very attractive on a comparative basis with similar fixed rate securities all in all the pre tax book yield on our core fixed income portfolio decreased 5 basis points in the quarter and was down 14 basis points for the year on a go forward basis we expect continued pressure on our book yield given the low interest rate environment however given our strong expected cash flow our 2020 after tax net investment income guidance of 185 million reflects the modest growth from 2019 although a lower roe contribution given the growth in stockholders equity our average fixed income credit rating remained strong at aa minus and the effective duration of our fixed income and short term investment portfolio is at the low end of the range at 3 6 years overall we continue to have the portfolio conservatively positioned risk assets which principally include high yield fixed income securities and alternative investments portfolio accounted for 8 of total invested assets as of the end of the year and remain under way our longer term target our alternative investment portfolio which includes limited partnerships in private equity private credit and real asset investment and reports on a one quarter lag generated a pre tax gain of 18 million for the year which was in line with 2018 tuning to capital our balance sheet remained very strong with 2 2 billion of gaap equity an increase of 22 for the year adjusted capital ratio was 20 1 at year end which is well below our target and provides us with financial flexibility we continue to operate at the low end of our premiums to surplus target range of 1 4 times to 1 6 times this flexibility at the operating level when combined with our 278 million of holding company liquidity provides us with meaningful capacity to grow if market opportunities present themselves at our 1 4 times operating leverage each combine ratio point equates to just under 1 point of roe in addition our 3 05 times investment leverage means that each point of pre tax book yield on our investment portfolio results in approximately 2 5 points of roe with regards to our reinsurance program we enjoyed a successful renewal of our catastrophe program on january 1 we maintained our existing structure that keeps 1 in 100 or 1 net probable maximum loss of p l from a major catastrophe risk us hurricane at a very manageable 2 of gaap equity and 1 in 250 nets the amount of 0 4 probability at 5 of gaap equity we also renewed our non footprint catastrophe program that drops our retention from 40 million to 5 million for our five new expansion states as well as our e s states outside of our original 22 state footprint which includes states such as florida texas and california pricing on cat program reflected the loss free status of our account and our continued efforts to generate strong renewal pricing in our property portfolio and continued efforts to diversify our exposure as a reminder our reinsurance program also includes access to loss agreements which limits the impact to us of individual loan losses to 2 million for both property and losses individual occurrences about 2 million are ceded under the effect of the loss agreements with that i will turn the call over to john to discuss our insurance operations john j marchioni president chief operating officer director thanks mark and good morning let me begin with a discussion of full year results of our operations by segment and then provide you with an overview of some of our strategic initiatives our standard commercial line segment which represents approximately 80 of premiums generated 8 net premiums written growth for the year continuing a consistent track record of strong and profitable growth segment generated new business growth of 8 stable retention of of 83 renewal pure price increases of 3 4 and an excellent combined ratio of 92 9 or 93 7 on an underlying base commercial lines renewal pure price increases increased 3 8 in the fourth quarter up sequentially from 3 5 in the third quarter we are happy with the overall direction of market pricing while it is worth noting that the increases so far have been greater for larger accounts and specialty risks than for the small and mid market standard lines accounts that make up the majority of our book we pride ourselves on managing our renewal pricing strategy in a highly granular fashion closely monitoring rate and retention by cohort of expected profitability our analysis uses a point of renewal retention measure that removes policies that canceled prior to expiration as we think that s the best indicator of the effectiveness of our pricing strategy on our highest quality standard commercial lines accounts which represented 49 of our commercial lines premiums we achieved renewal pure rate of 2 1 and point of renewal retention of 91 on the lower quality accounts which represented 11 of premiums we achieved renewal pure rate of 7 8 while retaining 80 at point of renewal our ability to analyze the risk and return characteristics of each renewal policy at an extremely granular level allows us to achieve additional loss ratio improvement through mix of business changes while maximizing overall retention drilling down to the results for the year by commercial line of business our largest line general liability achieved an 89 6 combined ratio which included favorable prior year reserve development totaling 5 million or 0 7 points we will continue to closely monitor this line for frequency and severity trends including litigation rates which have been relatively stable in recent quarters for the year we achieved renewal pure price increases of 2 2 for this line excluding umbrella and expect firming pricing environment heading into 2020 our workers comp line generated a 74 1 combined ratio aided by favorable reserve development totaling 68 million which accounted for 21 8 points on the combined ratio this favorable development related primarily to lower than expected severities for accident years 2017 and prior renewal pure pricing was down 2 8 and we continue to take a cautious approach to underwriting this line as market pricing remains aggressive commercial auto continues to produce disappointing results for us and the overall industry as elevated loss trend consumes earned rate increase our combined ratio for this line was 107 9 while we added 4 million of reserves in both the current and prior accident years loss trends have remained generally in line with expectations price increases averaged 7 5 in 2019 on top of similar price increases in each of the prior two years we ve been actively managing new and renewal portfolios in target business segments and improving rating and classification at an individual account level our commercial property book generated a 93 9 combined ratio or 7 1 point improvement from 2018 lower levels of bulk catastrophe and non catastrophe losses drove the improvement while market pricing has improved loss trends remain elevated and indicate the need for additional rate level our renewal pure price increases averaged 4 excluding in the marine and we are taking steps to address the drivers of the higher loss experience through business mix shifts and safety management efforts our personal lines segment which represented 11 of 2019 premiums reported a 2 decline in net premiums written mostly reflecting the more competitive market conditions in personal auto renewal pure price increases averaged 5 and retention remained solid at 83 new business however was down 21 for the year market competition in personal lines particularly for personal auto has become far more pronounced this year the segment produced a combined ratio of 97 3 or 88 6 on an underlying basis while maintaining adequate profitability remains a core focus we will be doing more in the areas of product customization modeling enhancements and distribution to ensure we are optimizing our position in this segment in personal auto net premiums written declined 1 for the year and the combined ratio was 106 4 results included 6 million of strengthening for prior accident year casualty reserves which added 3 5 points on the combined ratio renewal pure price increases averaged 8 9 for personal auto liability and 3 8 for physical damage while benefit to improved profitability of these price increases are clearly putting pressure on new business with market pricing under pressure and the favorable impact of loss trends diminishing we would expect deteriorating results for the industry in this line and less pricing picks up again the homeowners line reported 2 premium decline relative to a year ago and combined ratio of 96 5 that included 15 5 points of catastrophe losses as the majority of our premium is written on an account basis our competitive positioning in the auto line has hurt our homeowners growth renewal pure price increases averaged 3 for the year our e s segment which represented 9 of total premiums generated 4 net premiums written growth in 2019 the premium decline in the fourth quarter related primarily to our decision to exit the snow removal business which we discussed on last quarter s call the segment generated a 95 9 combined ratio for the year compared to 100 3 in 2018 overall renewal pure price increases averaged 4 over the past few years targeted price increases business mix changes and exiting specific underperforming classes of business have contributed to the improved combined ratio performance in this segment our e s book consists primarily a small account business with a similar risk profile to our standard lines while market pricing is increasing it is more muted for the lower hazard a business we write than for riskier classes that we don t such as large account casualty for coastal property let me now switch to some of our strategic initiatives which continue to drive our strong operating and financial performance we are very proud of our accomplishments in 2019 and focused on the following four objectives as we move through 2020 one using our sophisticated pricing tools to achieve standard commercial lines renewal pure price increases that are in line with expected loss trend two expanding share of wallet with our existing distribution partners and strategically appointing new partners three capitalizing on the investments we ve been making to deliver a superior omni channel customer experience and four identifying and addressing opportunities to enhance operational efficiencies and reduce our expense ratio over time through process redesign and technology enhancements we remain confident in the overall price adequacy and embedded profitability on our book of business we continue to achieve price increases where appropriate targeting accounts on a granular basis that are not meeting our profitability expectations the level of commercial lines renewal pure price increases we are seeing increase during the course of 2019 and 3 8 achieved in the fourth quarter are tracking in line with our expectation for loss trend if industry pricing continues to move higher as we expect we are well positioned to further improve underwriting margins second our superior distribution relationships and sophisticated underwriting tools are clear competitive advantages we will seek to capitalize on them as we execute on our strategy to generate profitable growth in the coming years our stated long term objective is to obtain a 3 commercial lines market share that objective is built around appointing partner relationships that control approximately 25 of their markets and achieving an average share of wallet of 12 across those relationships we have an additional commercial lines premium opportunity over time in excess of 2 7 billion if we hit our long term plans and can do so without having to stretch our underwriting appetite or shift our risk profile during 2019 we appointed 98 new distribution partners bringing the total to approximately 1 350 or 2 300 store fronts third we have made major strides in recent years to enhance the customer experience during 2019 we made a number of enhancements to our self service and digital offerings including a streamlined activation process and live chat option we now have a 360 degree view of our customers that allows us to continue to enhance our proactive communication program as we seek to create more customer value in 2019 we rolled out our new marketing tag line do you legally insure which speaks to our differentiated value proposition for distribution partners and customers investing in and building out technologies that improve our customers experience remains a core focus for us finally while we recognize it is essential to continue investing in the initiatives related to our technology platforms sophisticated underwriting tools and customer experience we re also committed to balancing these goals with an efficient operating structure we ll look at a number of areas to improve efficiencies including workflow and process improvements by better leveraging automation and robotics we expect our 2020 expense ratio to be slightly lower than 2019 as we balance our investment and expense management initiatives we are targeting an expense ratio of closer to 32 by the end of next year and we ll seek further improvements in subsequent years looking to 2020 and beyond we are in extremely strong financial and strategic position and are well positioned to continue generating superior results like we have in recent years we have an attractive book of in force business and have created a differentiated franchise with our distribution partners and customers i d like to close by sincerely thanking greg for his 40 years of service and 20 years of outstanding stewardship as ceo of selective he transformed the company into a truly unique franchise in the industry greg and i have worked in close partnership for much of the past decade we ve put in place a strategy that we believe keeps selective on a path to be a consistent industry leader and generate sustained outperformance in greg s new role as executive chairman i will continue to benefit from his guidance and wisdom as i transition into my new responsibilities now i ll turn the call back over to greg gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer thanks john to wrap up another excellent year by delivering our sixth consecutive year of double digit roes which places us among a very elite group of peers that have generated similar results we have the best teams of employees and distribution partners in the industry at selective we re very proud about what we do as a company by one helping our customers put their lives back together by responding promptly and with empathy after experiencing a loss two making our communities safer by providing tools and technologies to our insurers such as weather preparation guides as well as vehicle food and product recall notifications we are seeking to mitigate the risk of distracted and reckless driving with the offering of selective drive free of charge to our commercial lines customers and three providing financial stability to our customers we are the best positioned in this marketplace with an excellent book of business and the tools technology and best in class people in the industry to execute our plans i could not be happier to pass on the reigns of the company to john who will assume the role of chief executive officer effective tomorrow i have full and complete confidence that he will continue to transform selective into a truly unique company in the marketplace and an industry leader as we mentioned on our last conference call i will stay in the role of executive chairman for one year period with that operator we ll open up to questions thank you operator questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session first question is coming from mike zaremski from credit suisse your line is now open mike zaremski credit suisse analyst hey good morning gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer good morning mike mike zaremski credit suisse analyst first question maybe some just clarification on the combined ratio guidance i ve got a couple of questions so the 91 5 is excluding any reserve changes and catastrophes and if that s correct that compares to the for the 2019 number being 92 9 so which would imply a good deal of improvements or am i incorrect and there s you are baking in some potential for reserve releases in 20 gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer yeah mike let me start with that so now there is no reserve releases there that number has the 2021 the 91 5 is a number with no development in it and one of the things you have to remember there s a certain amount of expense ratio improvement in 20 over 19 the favorable development in 19 generated a lot of profit based compensation to employees and to agents so you get a little bit of a mismatch you see some of the favorable developments rolling through in a line item that you exclude but the incremental expenses incurred in 19 were in the underwriting expense ratio so i just want to make sure you ve got that point and that s about 40 basis points approximately between employee and agents overall and so you have some of that element then when you look at the improvement rolling to 20 the rest of it comes from as i mentioned and john mentioned the renewal price in line with trend and then there s underwriting and claim improvements outside of that that also add to some of the improvement john j marchioni president chief operating officer director and mike this is john let me just add one additional point to the final point that greg made relative to that underwriting mix improvement in particular we cite routinely every quarter the difference by cohort between our best business based on future profitability and what we believe to be the 10 or 11 of our portfolio that we think has a higher expected combined ratio going forward by having a lower retention on that business and a higher retention on that business we expect to produce higher combined or lower combined ratios excuse me that is where we generate mix improvement that will give you loss ratio benefit in addition to the difference between rating trends so just wanted to tie that together with the point greg was making mike zaremski credit suisse analyst okay yeah that s helpful and next i ll you might have said this in the prepared remarks mark but the general liability reserve deficiency sounded kind of minimal do you have the kind of the full year 2019 gl reserve development kind of versus 18 and if you don t have it i can take it offline and also remind me mark was there a was gl part of the true up in the current accident year as well in terms of the basis points you mentioned mark a wilcox executive vice president chief financial officer yeah mike so let me walk you through that we did make some modest adjustments in the fourth quarter related to general liability on the prior accident year it was an increase in the prior year reserves of 5 million but we had reflected some favorable development earlier in the year so for the full year 2019 there s actually 5 million of favorable reserve development on the tl liability line in 2019 and that compares to just under 10 million 9 5 million for the full year 2018 so relatively consistent when you re thinking about prior year reserves in the current accident year specifically related to 2019 we did increase the loss pick for general liability by 2 9 points in the quarter which was 5 million impact we had a very modest benefit earlier in the year so net net when you put it all together for 2019 it was a 3 million increase relatively stable lawsuit was flat so i d just consider that a little bit of fine tuning into new accident year mike zaremski credit suisse analyst okay that s perfect and i lastly john in your prepared remarks i believe you said litigation rates relatively stable past few quarters is that are you referring to the what some other firms have called the attorney representation rates and along those lines when we think about increasing loss cost for the industry and i mean you guys think about it especially in the gl or commercial auto line is the attorney rep rate is that one of the kind of biggest unknowns or risk factors or is it predominantly the severity of the lawsuits or both john j marchioni president chief operating officer director so mike this is john i ll start and i ll try to hit both parts of that question so there is a difference between litigation rates and attorney rep rates and what we referred to in our prepared comments was the relative stability over the last several quarters in our litigation rates and that s for all of our liability lines so litigated file is one that is as the name indicates in litigation those are easy to track and measure and see a change over time our attorney rep rates are going to also include files that are not yet in litigation but they are just are beliefs that there is an attorney representing a client those i will tell you are not as easy for us or anybody else to measure because it s a little bit more of knowledge on the part of the claims adjusted to understand whether or not there is any been any attorney communication those numbers will bounce around a little bit more they re going to be higher than litigation rates obviously many of those will not ultimately result in litigation and i think that leads to an important point that we have stressed on this topic in the past i would say really two fronts on this number one we do some modeling work and provide our adjusters very early in the claim lifecycle on files that have attributes that are more likely to result in litigation down the road what that does is make sure that hey we have the right adjuster on that file but can you make sure that there are early communication with that claimant is going to put them more at ease about how that claim is ultimately going to be resolved and that will in many cases help us avoid a litigated file now that sort of ties into your second point which is litigated files generally speaking and part of it s going to be because of the severity of the injuries claim by the claimant but litigated files are generally going to carry a higher severity than unlitigated files some of that is because of the cost of attorney involvement including your own attorney involvement as the company but part of it is also going to be because you re generally going to have higher damage levels on both the property side and the bodily injury side when there s lawyers involved gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer yeah so mike let me just this is greg so obviously to what you think about loss cost it s frequency times severity we closely monitor frequency activity and generally find that that is the leading indicator in terms of the composite of our breakdown your pure premium claims are coming in so we closely monitor that and between that and the severity that john went over is really what drives the overall loss ratio and the amount of loss mike zaremski credit suisse analyst okay and just lastly to be clear on that by the way your color is always extremely helpful are you seeing a little bit clearly given the i guess the texts were changed a little bit are you seeing a little bit of uplift in loss trend john j marchioni president chief operating officer director mike this is john as greg commented during his prepared comments we have adjusted our view over the last couple of years of future trend expectations which had been running around 3 are now pushing up closer to 4 just under 4 so that is reflective of what we ve seen in our own experience yeah i think this is probably an important point to just stress what we think is also are critical consideration when you think about changing loss trends in the industry which is you really want to start by understanding how you feel about the initial loss picks that company has established for their causality lines and we ve been very transparent about this and very consistent about this in all of our prior accident years in recent memory you will note that we talk about having an embedded assumption for future claims trends and that has always been embedded in our loss pick we ve also stressed the importance of achieving pure rate increases or pure price increases that meet or exceed that expected loss trend which is a great way to think about the strength of the loss picks that sit on every one of those older accident years and i just think that s an important consideration when you think about that changing environment to the extent it does happen and it happens industrywide it will hit the current and also hit the prior accident years but we have had that embedded assumption for claims inflation in our loss picks very consistently mike zaremski credit suisse analyst okay understood and greg all the best in your new role as executive chairman of the board thank you gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer mike thanks operator operator thank you the next question is coming from paul newsome from piper sandler your line is open paul newsome piper sandler analyst hi good morning and again congratulations to john and greg so a little bit of a follow up can we talk about rate versus the claims inflation i think if i read it right your true rate increase levels are a little bit below the 4 and does that mean that you ll be essentially pushing for more rate all things being equal next year to keep us up to the next year your at rate inflation gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer so paul this is greg yeah so that s why when we said that the 3 8 will establish the floor that s what the the fourth quarter we got 3 8 in rate and we view that as the floor going into 2020 so yes paul newsome piper sandler analyst okay and then i d love to hear your thoughts generally speaking on the commercial auto business which obviously has struggled for you and everybody else pretty much it doesn t seem like reunderwriting or at least pure rate is helping that much what are we missing there that you think could be the reason why the industry keeps falling behind gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer yeah i think that s a great question and i ll tell you what i think also in the industry principally was led by way higher frequency counts over expected that s what started it and then i think it also so i think that got misstating in 16 and rolled through various accident years was just underestimation and i think that in part reflected some of the societal issues regarding distracted driving regarding core driving habits regarding a lot of issues with a lot of congestion on the roads unemployment dropping people higher driving less experienced people on the road all of that added and just the general road deterioration i mean i m avoiding puddles all over the place now it seems like but it s just the general deterioration of the infrastructure i think that s added to that and i would tell you that one of the products that we offer the selective drive product specifically earmarked at that we offer that to our customers free of charge it allows them to manage their fleet their maintenance records but not only that it s the most important that it gives the driver a score at the end of the week in terms of how well they re driving which includes when they re on the phone what hard braking hard turning anything so that s a big when you look at the hawthorne effect that s a big additive factor that we can offer to our commercial fleets and then i would say the other part then is this whole issue around severity that worked its way in and so it was two areas that probably took a line that normally ran at about maybe 3 5 to 4 in that neck of the woods from a trend standpoint and pushed it to like 7 and then so everybody was getting rate in the 6 7 rate and that s where everybody was getting more of their commercial lines but that only started recently so all of this build up kind of caught everybody by i think a little bit behind the 8 ball but i would tell you that there is a big improvement combined ratios in commercial auto dropped from like 115 in the 115 area we re looking at 106 pretty much on an accident year basis at a current year basis so we actually feel pretty good about our improvement and when you look at where we re getting rate that s obviously our lead line from our rate and it s just under 8 in terms of renewal and that s pure rate so we feel that we can get ahead of it and we also feel maybe that the frequency counts relative to vehicles has kind of apexed right now paul newsome piper sandler analyst yeah i appreciate the color on the thanks for the answers and good luck in next year gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and the next question is coming from amit kumar from buckingham research your line is open amit kumar buckingham research analyst thanks and good morning i had a few follow ups on the same discussion as well just going back to i guess paul s question on pricing versus loss cost and the margin i think i m oversimplifying this a bit but i would have thought that now would be the time to press on pricing and maybe you can just help me understand that a bit better is it a function of the loss trends in your book the launching of your accounts but i would have thought that maybe the trajectory of pricing over 2020 the slope of the line would have been a tad different john j marchioni president chief operating officer director yeah so amit this is john i ll start so i guess first for us based on the fact that we are achieving our target margins and our focus on commercial lines here for us the conversation is more about price adequacy than it is about price maximization i mean that s what we believe in and that price adequacy is in terms of the overall portfolio and it s also on account by account basis you have seen with that in mind though some sequential improvement and it might appear slight but when you look at where our margins are that slight sequential improvement is a positive indication we don t include in our numbers any exposure any exposure change and i think when you look at what s happening in the industry you are seeing a lot more exposure included in the pricing numbers that are being put out there and while there might be some portion of that price number or exposure change that those act like rate much of it does not so we give you what s probably the most conservative view and insight into pricing let s also remember we don t exclude workers comp from our number and in our view if we were to exclude workers comp we probably should exclude it from our combined ratios as well to make the analysis complete so that s it s still a bit of a drag now that said we do think that and we reacted to it by raising our loss our future loss trend expectation up closer to 4 and that has caused us to view the rate need in our portfolio as a little bit higher and therefore we expect to push that as the year goes on now we are going to still do it on a very targeted basis though this is in our portfolio that doesn t justify a meaningful rate increase won t get one because our view is we re going to do what we can to protect that portfolio the flip side to that is the 10 to 15 of the portfolio that we view as having worse than desired combined ratio future combined ratios is going to be the focus of our effort and we re going to achieve higher rate levels there so i guess that s how i d respond overall in terms of how we think about the pricing environment and the other point i would also reinforce is if you look at the willis towers watson clips survey which we do cite frequently and greg cited earlier and look at it for the small account sub segment you re going to see a much lower number in there and a lot of the price headline is coming out of the specialty and e s areas is coming out of the coastal property and very large property accounts we haven t seen it as much in our core small and middle market lower medium hazard risk space that we re predominantly focused on amit kumar buckingham research analyst that s a fair comment so is it possible and i completely agree and appreciate your comment on exposures so it s simply not apples to apples looking at your numbers versus others but do you have the number excluding workers comp for the quarter or maybe could you even like talk about it sort of in generalities how much the delta would be if we exclude workers comp from the pricing john j marchioni president chief operating officer director yeah so and we gave you some of the pieces and i can t calculate on the slide for you what it would be ex comp we d have to wait it out but so gl excluding umbrella was 3 3 for the quarter commercial auto was 7 8 commercial property was 4 1 and bop for us which is a smaller line was 5 3 and then you ve got workers comp at a minus 2 7 so you re probably looking at something probably closer to 5 roughly if you were to look at an ex comp number maybe a little bit above 5 on an ex comp basis amit kumar buckingham research analyst got it and that s what i thought okay that s good the other question is also a follow up on the litigation trends and we ve talked about this on several conference calls and we expect to talk about this i know in the past we ve talked about reviver this question is not on reviver can you when you sort of look at your trend line on the litigation trends and then you look at all the reports out there we should look at litigation trends etc when you look at your own book do you think the reason why we haven t seen that level of increased activity versus some of the larger companies is it more because of the account size is it the geographical mix or maybe it s a combination of all of it but maybe just talk about that a little more so that we can get some confidence that these trends will remain stable versus some of the other larger companies thanks john j marchioni president chief operating officer director yeah so i think there clearly are differences and you would expect differences in terms of where the plaintiffs bar is going to target in terms of individual companies and the type of company we do right is going to be less of a target but i think we do look at inflationary trends or claims inflation as not just entirely focused on the headline litigation or headline settlements amount that you see to the extent it s happening it will ultimately start to make its way up and down the marketplace i don t think there is a geographic difference when you look at our footprint our footprint is concentrated in the eastern half of the us with some of the southwest expansion but for us you also want to look at the hazard levels and we do still right a predominantly low and medium hazard class of business with a low limits profile and i know a lot of companies cite their limits profile and ours is certainly on the lower end for most and that will provide some protection if in fact we do see an acceleration of claims i ll also say that while our own litigation rates haven t really moved as we ve mentioned and we focus in terms of our view of our reserves on our own experience we certainly pay attention to what s being stated and what others are saying in the broader industry and have a keen eye on that relative to what might potentially emerge but to sit here and say with clarity that frequency or severity trends are going to be x or y in future years is just tough to get comfortable with amit kumar buckingham research analyst got it the last question i have is on the gl development i think you were responding to mike and i ll go back and look at the transcript but my understanding was there was adverse of 5 million and did you was that from ay 2018 17 i didn t get the details in terms of the moving parts of that 5 million thanks mark a wilcox executive vice president chief financial officer yeah amit it s mark it was 5 million of adverse development in the quarter but i think it s best to look at the full year which was 5 million of favorable development in the general liability lines so there s obviously always some quarterly volatility it s a relatively small number on a big book of business this reflected a little bit of fine tuning in some respects is going into the new year and then as it related to the current accident year and i mentioned this earlier but just for the sake of clarification it was also 5 million on the 2019 accident year so we had a modest benefit earlier in the year so for the full year it was 3 million so if you net the 3 million in the 5 million it s a bit of a wash against the current and the prior related to gl line it reflects a line of business that we ve had reasonably stable trends amit kumar buckingham research analyst got it and then then was that related to like an account or is that just more fine tuning across the book john j marchioni president chief operating officer director it s more across the book and when you think about that small dollar number across multiple of prior accident years there s not even going to be an individual year you would look at but i would say it would definitely have been more in the more recent accident year 17 18 amit kumar buckingham research analyst got it that s all i have thanks for the answers and good luck in your new roles greg and john thanks gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer thank you john j marchioni president chief operating officer director thank you gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer operator next question operator thank you the next question is coming from mark dwelle from rbc capital markets your line is now open mark dwelle rbc capital markets analyst yeah good morning let me just start by giving my well wishes to greg i ve very much appreciated you valuable insights and you will always be among the ivy league of ceos in my book so good luck to you going forward gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer thank you thank you mark mark dwelle rbc capital markets analyst the first question just something fairly simple the corporate expense line item is much lower than the other quarters i think this was the same as a year ago just is there something is there a credit or some seasonality or something i would have thought the comp expense alone would have been more than 2 6 million in a quarter mark a wilcox executive vice president chief financial officer yeah mark it s mark wilcox and let me jump in and greg and john can follow on as well the corporate expense line item it does have an element of volatility and a little bit of seasonality to it so it was running in the 35 million range a few years back it was 25 million now it s again 31 this year it mainly include it s not all but mainly includes stock based compensation and a portion of that call it 25 is what we call liability based and so the recent volatility it is driven really by a couple of factors one there s a peer group factor and two there s also a total shareholder return back and the reason it was down in the quarter was as you re all well aware in q4 and that drove a benefit or credit in that line item in the quarter just as a reminder as you look ahead to 2020 there is some seasonality typically see a heavier front end load in q1 of the new year related to the corporate expense line item given the retirement eligibility and the full expensing of stock based compensation for those individuals that are retirement eligible and receive an award gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer and i would say just the changes that we made to the plan overall now that you have all the years that are now eligible to be expensed in theory that three year period under the new plan it will reduce the overall amount of volatility in the line mark dwelle rbc capital markets analyst okay that s that s helpful thanks second question john you had provided some pretty good pricing segmentation information with respect to the commercial lines book do you have similar information you can share related to the e s book john j marchioni president chief operating officer director well we haven t traditionally i can tell you that we do a similar segmentation but it s more based on industry classification and our targets our target pricing levels to achieve our target roe we do certainly manage it that way internally it s just not something we ve reported about externally but it s the same very granular approach that we take in managing both new and renewal business in the e s segment mark dwelle rbc capital markets analyst okay staying on the e s book any additional insight you can share related to the reserve addition in that business i mean i know it s kind of gone back and forth over the years but is there anything different about loss trend or litigation or anything there gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer mark it s so small it s not even that large so i would say it s just minor year end adjustments that come through based on slight modifications it s not material really its not significant overall mark a wilcox executive vice president chief financial officer yeah it was 2 million in the current quarter on the prior accident year and 2 million in the current quarter on the current accident year but it s relatively modest again a little bit of fine tuning going as we roll over into new accident year they can show we feel confident in our reserve inventory but nothing i think we d point to trends i think the good news obviously with the e s segment as john highlighted is a strong level of profitability it s best year yet from a profitability perspective in the e s still some work to be done to drive toward the target level of risk adjusted debt profitability in e s but the reserve last year we had a 12 million addition so trending in the right direction and to some fourth quarter minor adjustments gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer yeah i would just add to that mark i mean we ve come a long way us about target surcharges that john i think we track that i mean it could tell you exactly where the new renewal is and we are been in this market we ve for the past several years i have never been totally satisfied with what we have been getting or the amount of increases that we re getting on the renewal side we have seen change in that we have done a lot of work on our renewal inventory to get them closer and closer to where our target surcharges need to be and we have been very happy relative to the new business that we put on the books and where that is relative to target surcharge so that s come a long way and again you know us we put in a lot of discipline in it and we want to make sure that that business is profitable we ve always told you that it will the top line will go up or down more based on market conditions and that i think will happen overtime mark dwelle rbc capital markets analyst okay that s helpful and then one last question and this is i suppose it s more of almost a thought question as anything else but i m trying to gauge the kind of the sense of where the market tone is or the from the customers perspective as you go to customers with renewal rate increase requests whatever level they happen to be 5 2 8 whatever i mean what kind of push back are you getting i mean are people understanding of the need for rate is it more than unusually adversarial how does that conversation go at this stage john j marchioni president chief operating officer director yes mark it s john so obviously the answer is going to be it depends it depends on the size of the rate increase and it depends on the individual producer who owns that relationship at our independent agency and their approach to managing that process i will say for us we have really prided ourselves on maintaining that routine balance between price and trend over a long period of time so we re not in a situation where you ve got a 10 or 15 rate under overall portfolio so that minimizes the impact overall when you think about what we re asking of our agents in terms of selling increases now that said we do have very specific discussions and expect our agency partners to be able to have that specific discussion with that smaller percentage of the inventory that is going to get a higher than average increase based on risk characteristics or experience of that account and i will say that based on our overall retention and our retention by cohorts the customers understand that and our distribution partners do a good job of explaining that so i don t necessarily feel like that s a huge impediment at this point executing on our pricing strategy but i will say if we just took an across the board approach and we re trying to fix a loss ratio problem which we re not it would be a lot harder to execute in this kind of an environment because there are enough companies like we are that are well positioned with their pricing sophistication to go out and take those opportunities that look attractive when a company is taking an across the board rate increase gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer and mark this is greg so the other side to that too it really comes down to more than the general economic conditions so with gdp growing businesses growing top line revenue growing price increases are a little bit easier to take in as a customer versus years ago when gdp was not growing and you re trying to raise rate and everybody s looking through their balance sheet looking through their p l to figure out what expense lines they can cut does make it a little bit easier relative to that and the other point that john made earlier relative to what we re doing in customer experience relative to everything that we re doing to build more customer connectivity whether it s our security mentor product that we recently rolled out or drive product the product recalls that we re offering all of the additional work that we do to build more and more contactability to the end customer we want to make sure that when we do need to sell a larger price increase someone would sit there and say ok this is all the value that i m getting from selective and it s not just the insurance policy it s way more than that and we believe that over time that should help our retention help our net promoter scores help all of our osat scores and everything else that we track internally that will make it make a different long term mark dwelle rbc capital markets analyst well thanks very much for that i appreciate the additional insight thanks operator thank you and the next question is coming from matt carletti from jmp your line is now open matt carletti jmp analyst all right thanks just have a quick one i wanted to ask a question on workers comp growth was up 5 in the quarter that s the strongest number we ve seen in a while actually first positive we ve seen in a while just wanted to ask what s going on there i mean i think you gave us the rates so we know it s not that is it good new business production underlying kind of economic work activity was there some audit premium to catch up just what kind of gave us that growth in the quarter john j marchioni president chief operating officer director yeah matt this is john i would say and again remember we write predominantly account business and very little monoline workers comp so you want to think about workers comp growth in the overall context of the very strong quarter we had in commercial lines commercial lines growth was at 11 and that was driven by both strong retention and a solid new business quarter and i would say when you look at the growth in comp relative to the other lines it s still the lowest growth line at that percent but stronger in the quarter certainly i wouldn t necessarily as you said pricing wasn t that materially different than what we saw in the first three quarters i just think we had a stronger growth quarter overall and that helped a little bit the growth in the workers comp segment we have not seen meaningful change in the competitive landscape in comp i will tell you that continues to be especially for small lower hazard workers comp probably the most aggressive market in any segment that we play in you ve seen a lot of companies continue to be very aggressive and we love our results we love our book of business we feel good about the book of business we have but we also recognize that loss trends in that line can continue the downward trajectory they ve been on for both frequency and severity and we re just being cautious about growing that relative to the overall growth of the commercial lines operation matt carletti jmp analyst got you just to kind of tie in that last comment there together i mean am i right to infer that as you go through the component pieces of obviously you gave us guidance that implies kind of accident year margin improvement 20 versus 19 for the overall book that this might be a component where it might tweak the other way a little bit that rates down a few percent and i mean unless trend continues in that direction in which it sounds like it s not an assumption that you d make off the bat that that might be a component that goes a little bit the other way as we go forward john j marchioni president chief operating officer director we give you overall combined ratio guidance and we will give it to you by line but based on how we talk about rate and trends i think the way you described our view of comp would be a fairly accurate description matt carletti jmp analyst great well greg and john congrats and best of luck going forward john j marchioni president chief operating officer director thanks matt gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and the next question is coming from ron bobman from capital returns your line is open ron bobman capital returns analyst hi thanks a lot and greg you ve been awesome i sure have learned a lot and you ve always pointed us in the smart direction so thanks a ton gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer thank you ron bobman capital returns analyst greg a little while ago in the call you mentioned the commercial auto combined was at 115 and now it s at 106 but i m wondering what sort of date or what window or what quarter or what year you were sort of referencing that if i have those numbers right the movement occurred over gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer yeah so let me just pull that out in a second hold on a second let me just spread the lines here so all right so year to date commercial auto in 18 the cap the combined ratio call 116 was the calendar year trend and the accident year was 1 08 pretty close to that in the underlying combined ratio for that year and now we re running call it for this 2019 year commercial auto the combined ratio was a 1 08 and the underlying combined ratio was like a 107 in that neck of the wood so that gives you a little bit of idea as to the movement and what was happening and that s what i was referring to earlier ron bobman capital returns analyst got you and given how rates have been should i think that q4 19 numbers are marginally better than the 108 and 107 that was booked for the whole year or the rate increase has been pretty consistent gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer yeah ron i think the way we build our plan is let s put it this way the way our planning process works the base year is a four year average and then we re projecting that forward so we look at any liability line we re estimating break it down ultimately through a frequency severity number amount and then that ratio is pretty is consistent in liability throughout the year we re not market weighting or price adjusting quarter to quarter so generally speaking on any liability line you ll see unless we re making modifications to it it would be the same ratio every quarter what you do see as volatility in commercial auto though could be the property side and that could be weather specific so that could come from property whether it comes from property damage frequency on the liability side but it also could come through physical damage on that side and that s what could create a little bit more up and down on that number versus a straight liability line like gl or workers compensation where you d see virtually the same kind of ratio throughout the quarters ron bobman capital returns analyst okay thanks you ve mentioned i think just qualitatively but i could have missed it retention i m curious to know how commercial lines retention was in q4 as compared to q3 sequentially please john j marchioni president chief operating officer director yes so retention for our commercial lines was 84 in the quarter and i d give you the full year number which was 83 i don t have the individual first three quarters but that would suggest that it was relatively gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer relatively stable a year ago in q4 18 it was a little bit lower at 83 and then throughout the year it was 84 83 84 84 and the full year at 83 so relatively stable retention throughout the year ron bobman capital returns analyst got you that s great elasticity as far as that supporting you to push more rate i guess or like you said a baseline i think is what greg said going into 2020 gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer thank you for picking up on that ron bobman capital returns analyst last question putting aside selective s and you highlighted really small e s book as compared to your admitted book from a more general perspective this challenge of increased loss cost a portion of which is driven by attorney representation and the distinction between that and litigated claims do you think that an e s book would be more resilient to that challenge than an admitted book or it s both are going to sort of face the same delta from loss cost inflation being driven by litigation or attorney representation in one form or another john j marchioni president chief operating officer director yeah ron this is john i would say generally speaking i don t think it s going to be that different but it also depends on the segment of the e s market we re talking about i do think if you re writing in the space of the e s market that is really high exposure products higher hazard classes of business you might see a little bit more of an acceleration in terms of claims trends but i would say for us our book is predominantly small contractors small habitational small restaurants and mercantile and service businesses small limits profile not high profile exposures it would be more akin to what we would expect to see in our standard lines book mark a wilcox executive vice president chief financial officer yes and i think greg quoted a number earlier on that limits profile casualty within stated commercial lines 1 million or less 87 of the book and an e s for casualty for the 1 million and below is 98 so a very similar limits profile even perhaps a little bit more conservative gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer and again everybody focuses on the issues that could raise loss cost we do as well and i just want to make sure we get out there is a tremendous amount of effort internally in the organization john touched on the litigation propensity models the escalation models that we have what we re doing in the area of complex claims some of the other work that i know we re starting on relative to robotics in certain areas what we re also doing to find out when we look at losses and sit there and say what is it that we can do to help mitigate some of the losses whether it s notification whether it s education and we ve got a lot of efforts on that and those are things that will pay off on the longer term and normally would not we re not going to see any credit come through in the near term relative to the loss ratios but they are a part of analyzing the loss costs analyzing how you get back to strength analyzing how and some of the things you can do in ensure tech to help mitigate that are all things that we need to be focused on to reduce loss costs so those efforts are under way but will pay off over time ron bobman capital returns analyst thanks and greg thanks for time again you ve been great and you re leaving us i think well protected and well led with john take care gregory e murphy chairman chief executive officer i hear you ron operator

the headlong rush of justin trudeau s minority liberal government to the right was on full display this past week as canada s house of commons met for the first time in 2020 reflecting the fact that canada s ruling class is coming into ever more direct conflict with a resurgent working class at home and is aggressively asserting its predatory interests on the world stage trudeau announced that his government s top priority is adopting the united states mexico canada agreement usmca and welcomed to ottawa juan guaidó the us backed venezuelan coup leader on wednesday the liberals introduced legislation to ratify usmca the agreement signed into law by us president donald trump the same day aims to consolidate a us dominated trade bloc in north america to confront the global commercial and strategic rivals of american and canadian imperialism it strengthens trump s hand in his trade war with china while also accelerating the general breakdown of the global economy into competing trade blocs the deal which effectively prevents canada and mexico from concluding free trade agreements with non market economies a euphemism for china and increases north american production requirements to gain tariff free access to the usmca market was negotiated by the trudeau liberals in close cooperation with the trade unions jerry dias and hassan yussuff respectively the presidents of unifor and the canadian labour congress functioned as close advisers to the government during the talks prompting trudeau to remark that his liberals the canadian bourgeoisie s preferred party of government for over a century enjoy a special partnership with the unions the new democrats voted with the liberals conservatives and greens in favour of considering the usmca legislation leaving the bloc quebecois to cast the only dissenting votes the ndp s pro usmca vote was meant as a clear signal from the social democrats to trudeau that he can rely on them in securing a parliamentary majority on issues critical to the interests of canadian imperialism after failing to win a majority in last october s federal election trudeau s liberals require the support of at least 13 opposition mps for a parliamentary majority one day prior to tabling the usmca bill trudeau took the provocative step of meeting with guaidó whose self proclamation as interim president in january 2019 was orchestrated by washington with ottawa providing ground support guaidó has served as the front man for the north american imperialist powers drive to oust venezuela s democratically elected president nicolás maduro underscoring the crucial role played by canada in the us led campaign of military threats sanctions and bullying against maduro guaidó made a point of thanking trudeau when they met for canada s leading international role canada s international role has been to act as co chair of the lima group which has provided democratic cover for the us regime change operation while regularly offering a platform for leading trump administration officials to deliver bellicose threats of us military action against venezuela in november the trudeau government also backed a coup in bolivia which brought to power far right fascistic forces backing regime change operations like these with hard power is a key motivation for the liberals plan to hike military spending by more than 70 percent by 2026 under conditions of deepening great power conflicts trudeau has also expanded canadian military involvement in us imperialism s major strategic offensives around the world including against nuclear armed russia and china trump s america first agenda has cut across the interests of the canadian bourgeoisie it has found itself the target of us tariffs and threats and increasingly internationally isolated as multilateral institutions crumble all this has only strengthened the resolve of the trudeau government and the entire ruling class to safeguard and enhance canada s military strategic partnership with washington the foundation from which canadian imperialism has advanced its interests around the world for the past eight decades to this end the trudeau government welcomed trump s illegal assassination of iranian general qassem suleimani in early january one month earlier trudeau had emerged as one of the leading defenders of nato s continued relevance after french president emmanuel macron described the us led military alliance as brain dead on the domestic front trudeau responded to ruling class demands following the oct 21 election that he conciliate the hard right premiers of alberta and saskatchewan by proclaiming his commitment to national unity and by appointing the war hawk chrystia freeland as deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs minister the liberals embrace of alberta s jason kenney saskatchewan s scott moe and ontario s right wing populist premier doug ford with whom trudeau had an early post election kiss and make up session is bound up with the fact that they intend to pursue similar pro business policies at the federal level finance minister bill morneau has warned that canada must prepare for a possible global downturn by reining in government spending meanwhile the trudeau government has pushed through an income tax cut similar to that advocated by andrew scheer and his conservatives in the fall election campaign the liberals have touted their tax cut as a boon for those with low incomes but the poorest canadians will get nothing and much of the tax savings will go to the upper middle class and rich moreover the cut which will cost more than 6 billion annually when fully implemented will soon be cited by the government and opposition alike as a further argument for public spending austerity the trudeau government has also again displayed its readiness to enforce anti worker measures directly when 3 000 cn rail workers went on strike in late november in protest at intolerable working conditions the liberals made clear that if the teamsters didn t soon call off the strike they would intervene with back to work legislation that this was no idle threat is shown by the liberals outlawing in november 2018 of a campaign of rotating strikes by 50 000 postal workers in the end the teamsters shut down the strike without informing their members as to the details of the proposed contract settlement let alone allowing them to vote on it and thanked the trudeau government for helping broker the deal workers must be warned under conditions of a resurgence of the class struggle in canada and internationally the unions and ndp are deepening their collaboration with the pro austerity pro war liberal government recent weeks have seen close to 200 000 ontario teachers stage walkouts to fight the ford government s education cuts a bitter two month lockout of oil refinery workers in regina saskatchewan and protests in alberta against kenney s spending cuts and demands for wage rollbacks leaders of unions that suppressed the class struggle for decades have begun voicing the fear that mounting worker militancy could escape their control and result in a challenge to bourgeois rule this was summed up recently by alberta union of public employees president guy smith who warned kenney the anger that has built up is now in danger of spilling out into the streets this makes the role of the nominally left ndp all the more vital for the canadian bourgeoisie like social democracy and the trade unions the world over the ndp acts as the most loyal defender of the capitalist order using progressive bluster to defuse working class opposition and harness it to parliament and the political establishment the ndp s latest initiatives in this regard are a pledge to introduce a national pharmacare bill that is tailored to the liberals own proposal and a proposed anti scab bill that the social democrats know has no chance of being adopted much more significant than this posturing was ndp leader jagmeet singh s statement that the ndp was prepared to proceed in the right manner on usmca a promise they swiftly fulfilled by voting with the government to initiate debate on adopting the protectionist anti china trade deal and the social democrats support for other key elements in canadian imperialism s agenda these include the ndp s full throated backing of the liberal government s plans to spend tens of billions on purchasing new fleets of warships and fighter jets and their rallying behind the canadian elite s increasingly bellicose anti china campaign the author also recommends ndp props up trudeau joins conservatives in demanding tougher anti china stance

bloomberg markets viewed from a desk on wall street trade can look like an inaccessible agglomeration of breathless headlines about escalating economic wars and sterile data yet up close the buying and selling of goods and services is an astonishing organism here geopolitical decisions and the markets responses to them have daily physical consequences to capture an ordinary day during this extraordinary period in the history of the global economy bloomberg markets deployed reporters across the world to see the inner workings of trade up close from storefronts in seoul and tokyo to border crossings in africa and the middle east wednesday dec 4 was ostensibly a day like any other what the reporters saw were the nuts and bolts of a global economy that whether because of the march of technology or the consequences of rising protectionism and shifting trade patterns is confronting an inevitable and possibly irreversible wave of change shawn donnan lock 27 mississippi river it s

motley haul of soybeans steel slag and benzene the linked convoy is 1 140 feet long and 105 feet wide or the equivalent of a quarter mile stretch of interstate that spans nine lanes and holds 870 truckloads of cargo the lock in granite city ill is just 5 feet wider than the barges delicate stuff observing this from lock 27 s control room is quentin pearson a 61 year old u s navy veteran darting back and forth he reaches for his radio to give instructions to a pair of tugs waiting to go north after the donna rushing s load heading south is safely through then he rushes back over to the computers that control the lock s valves and gates from there he ll lower the water level by 7 feet sending the donna rushing on its way to st louis once the tug and its convoy are safely in the

out for work standing between him and the job site is this crossing he ll walk through a chute like passageway pass a security screening and stare into a facial scanner before emerging on the other side it s not quite the ordeal it used to be the biometric identification step is new and it s transformed his daily routine before it came along salahat would set out for work at around 3 30 a m now he doesn t have to leave until 5 30 a m before i used to wait for a long time and people were late for work he says checkpoints between the west bank and israel are a fact of life for tens of thousands of palestinians they were put in place to control the passage of 3 million palestinians between israel and the west bank territory it took in the 1967 middle east war the scanners may speed things up but their surveillance capabilities are controversial they could be used to target some people says issam aruri director of the jerusalem legal aid and human rights center a palestinian research and advocacy organization it is one of our serious concerns that concern has spread beyond the middle east microsoft corp s venture capital fund is an investor in an israeli computer vision and facial recognition startup whose technology is used at checkpoints after news reports said the company anyvision interactive technologies ltd was engaged in mass surveillance of palestinians beyond the checkpoints microsoft announced an audit into anyvision s compliance with its ethical principles on the use of facial recognition anyvision says its technology is used for identification and security at crossings not for surveillance the scanners are part of israel s more than 300 million shekel 87 million investment in the past few years to upgrade crossings nobody is interested in

sows now he has 1 500 females that deliver 800 piglets per week trade wars or not human diets are changing in places such as china last year was very good to fries it was the best year ever he says fries can t be sure of what s going to happen in coming years his healthier profits in 2019 stemmed largely from a disease that ravaged china s hog herd the world s largest the chinese are very smart and fast he says we need to be careful about raising production because they could recover their own production and we ll be left oversupplied so fries keeps to his daily routine feeding and vaccinating the animals inseminating the sows supervising the births and watching over an additional 100 hectare farm where he grows soybeans and corn he sells off the piglets at four weeks old ultimately fries s production is determined by the cooperativa central aurora alimentos brazil s third largest meat producer the cooperative s pork plant in nearby chapeco which slaughters the pigs

trade war as hundreds of staff pour in for their morning shift trucks and cranes creak and bang while ships are loaded and unloaded containers are stacked several stories high like giant lego bricks bearing the names of the world s big shipping companies with few obvious signs of a trade war quayside the impact of the u s china dispute is more apparent inside executive offices where hushed tones and carpeting muffle the noisy backdrop peter levesque a group managing director of modern terminals ltd which owns and operates container facilities says volumes at the port the world s seventh largest are down not all of the decline reflects the barrage of higher tariffs stiffer rivalry from chinese and regional competitors also plays a part but the trade war is leaving a visible mark levesque says the guys in the cranes can see for themselves whether there is a ship underneath or not he says the fewer ships they certainly talk about that they know what the state of the market is for now levesque says the workers on the ground the port employs about 6 000 people appear to be broadly shielded from these developments that s important because the livelihoods of 180 000 hong kongers depend indirectly on the port economy as it is trade tensions china s economic slowdown and the political strife that s engulfed the former colony have taken a toll with the hong kong economy falling into recession in 2019 tweets pertaining to tariffs from trump s phone have continued to fan uncertainty for executives such as levesque who s returning to the u s after living in asia for more than 25 years to become president of ports america group inc the largest marine terminal operator and stevedore in north america time for longer term strategic planning now competes with efforts

robotic assembly line that will turn out electric engine components for bmw cars by the company canteen a forklift operator is getting ready for the early shift s lunch break with 800 employees and 1 8 billion koruna 79 million in annual sales motor jikov is one of more than a hundred auto parts companies scattered across this central european country together with factories owned by the likes of volkswagen ag and hyundai motor co they form the backbone of the czech economy and are often a weather vane of global trade the watchword here caution we haven t seen any slowdown in orders yet says miroslav dvorak motor jikov s general manager and co owner but we always have to be prepared as it can hit us immediately and without warning we have orders for a month and then everything can change some changes are unpredictable such as the u s threat of tariffs on auto imports or the u k s exit from the european union others you can see coming such as the industrywide shift from combustion to electric engines but that doesn t make them easier to deal with the eu s push to curb greenhouse gas emissions will ultimately force motor jikov to replace about half of its current output with greener products that dvorak says is why he s been signing off on investments of as much as 150 million koruna a year for robotic assembly lines and other equipment to make more sophisticated parts used in electric cars and it s still not clear whether such upgrades will be enough to keep up with the pace of change even so employees at dvorak s factory located near the czech border with austria

shopping district it s a cold crisp day and shoppers are snapping up the japanese retailer s popular lightweight winter wear and undergarments something s missing though where are the signboards calling on south korean shoppers to boycott japanese merchandise those admonitions had popped up during the latest standoff in a long trade dispute between the two countries this particular episode was nominally about export controls but it was sparked by a seoul court ruling in 2018 that a number of world war ii korean forced labor victims could claim compensation from japanese companies talks between leaders eventually meant that the boycott could be lifted this signaled a truce in what some see as a classic case of governments wielding trade policy as a weapon in a noneconomic feud japan denies weaponizing trade in this way but underlying century old grievances over japan s treatment of koreans remain an impediment to less contentious relations between the two countries consumers may be more willing to move on than their governments that seems to be the case at uniqlo in seoul and so it is along the colorful streets of the shin okubo shopping district in tokyo where korean hangul

economists generally expect wages to rise significantly at the peak of the business cycle the fact that this is not happening today is seen as something of a paradox according to the u s bureau of labor statistics the u s economy is experiencing an unemployment rate that is currently december 2019 at a fifty year low yet wage growth continues to be weak with continuing wage stagnation even at the peak of the business cycle adjusted for inflation wage rates rose only 1 1 percent in november 2019 from the previous november bureau of labor statistics real earnings november 2019 news release december 11 2019 one explanation for the continuing wage stagnation is that the employment to population ratio remains historically low having partially recovered but currently standing at 80 3 percent where it was in 2007 at the brink of the last recession when similar issues were being raised participation by prime age workers hits 10 year high wall street journal november 1 2019 federal reserve board of st louis employment population ratio november 2019 another factor is the drop in the rate of private sector unionization in the united states which has fallen to 6 4 percent bureau of labor statistics union members summary economic news release january 18 2019 additionally corporate outsourcing of production to the global south facilitated by the north american free trade agreement and other similar trade deals has had the effect of pulling down u s wages as part of a global race to the bottom however a major and largely undertheorized reason for the sluggish wages in a period of seeming full employment is to be found in the fact that the new jobs being created by the economy do not measure up to those of the past in terms of weekly wages and hours or in the degree to which they support households or even individuals in the language of workers they are bullshit jobs not real jobs in november 2019 cornell law school in collaboration with the coalition for a prosperous america the university of missouri kansas city and the global institute for sustainable prosperity introduced the u s private sector job quality index available at with monthly data derived from the current employment survey extending from 1990 to the present and with plans to update the series each month the new job quality index jqi examines the percentage of the private sector jobs of production and nonsupervisory workers 82 percent of all private sector workers that are high quality jobs compared with low quality jobs job quality is measured by weekly wages weekly hours of employment multiplied by hourly wages with high quality jobs associated with weekly wages that are above the mean for full time workers and low quality jobs associated with weekly wages that are below the mean a jqi ratio of less than 100 means that the ratio is skewed toward low quality jobs in 1990 the jqi level was 94 9 percent by july 2019 it had dropped to 79 percent low wage low hour jobs constituted 52 7 percent of all jobs of production and nonsupervisory workers in 1990 while in the last three decades 63 percent of all new production and nonsupervisory jobs have had low wages low hours in short jobs are becoming more and more precarious a category that karl marx utilized to define those employed workers who were part of the stagnant section of the reserve army of labor or relative surplus population characterized by low and static wages low hours and unregulated unstable working conditions karl marx capital vol 1 796 98 according to forbes more than a third 36 percent of u s workers are part of the gig economy amounting to some 57 million people tj mccue 57 million workers are part of the gig economy forbes august 31 2018 forty percent of hourly paid workers in the united states between the ages of 26 and 32 do not know their work schedules a week in advance richard v reeves capitalism is failing people want a job with a decent wage why is that so hard guardian april 24 2019 the november 2019 jqi study indicates the gap between the weekly wages of production and nonsupervisory workers above and below the mean has increased almost fourfold on an inflation adjusted basis over the last three decades the biggest reason for this growing gap between high quality and low quality jobs however is not the hourly wage increases associated with high quality jobs which grew about 10 percent faster adjusted for inflation than that of low quality jobs over the period but rather the discrepancy in the actual hours worked associated with high quality versus low quality jobs the average hours worked in high quality jobs have remained essentially flat at 38 3 hours per week dropping only twenty four minutes since 1997 in contrast low quality jobs as a group have seen a net reduction in hours worked per week by a full hour since 1999 alone and now average about thirty hours a week the shorter hours of low quality jobs are to a considerable extent the result of the efforts by employers to avoid mandated benefit thresholds with the result that most of these jobs are also without benefits needless to say such precarious employment makes it much more difficult for workers to unionize the wider implications of all this in terms of the real slack in the labor market or effective underemployment are enormous as the authors of the jqi report declare if the average p ns worker in a low quality job were working for the same number of average hours as those in high quality jobs that would translate into the unutilized worker hour equivalent of a whopping 12 6 million jobs this suggests that the actual u s reserve army of labor in terms of working hours lost is far beyond what is indicated by the usual data on unemployment and underemployment with the diminishing share of high quality jobs and the rapid growth in the skew toward low quality jobs more and more workers are faced with financial disincentives to working with its added intended costs and are forced to fall back on family members take early social security and so on given the oppressive structure of u s society the highest ratios of workers employed in low quality jobs are to be found among african american latinx immigrant and women workers a related november 2019 study by the brookings institution indicates that 44 percent of all prime age workers between the ages of 18 and 64 are low income workers defined as those who earn less than two thirds of the median wage for full time male workers adjusted for the regional cost of living low income workers currently have an average hourly wage of 10 22 and average annual earnings of 18 000 martha ross and nicole bateman low wage work is more pervasive than you think and there aren t enough good jobs to go around brookings november 21 2019 reade pickert for 53 million americans in low wage jobs a difficult road out bloomberg november 17 2019 thirty percent of low wage workers 16 million people have earnings below 150 percent of the poverty line the localities with shares of low wage workers that are 46 percent or more of all workers are concentrated primarily in the west and the south yet they exist in sizable proportions in all regions there are nearly a million low wage workers in the washington dc area 700 000 in both boston and san francisco and 560 000 in seattle most of these workers live and work under extremely precarious conditions these dire conditions lie behind the decline in life expectancy of the u s population much of it attributed to growing suicides and the opioid crisis julia haskins suicide opioids tied to ongoing fall in us life expectancy nation s health february march 2019 the jqi report indicates that the trend toward low quality jobs reflects a relative devaluation of u s domestic labor constituting a higher rate of exploitation of u s workers through forced reductions in the historically determined value of labor power not only are wages and hours low but many workers such as those employed in expanding goods shipping warehouses are subjected to relentless speedups and evermore sophisticated monitoring systems the rapid degradation of the conditions of u s workers can be seen when comparisons are made with other advanced capitalist economies a 2017 study by economists thomas piketty emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman indicates that while the bottom 50 percent of incomes were 11 percent lower in france than in the us in 1980 they are now 16 percent higher economic growth in the us a tale of two countries vox march 29 2017 in fact the bottom 50 percent of income earners make more in france than in the us even though average income per adult is still 35 percent lower in france than in the us since the welfare state is more generous in france the gap between the bottom 50 percent of income earners in france and the us would be even greater after taxes and transfers similarly canadian workers are significantly better off than their u s counterparts up through the 56th percentile that is encompassing most of the canadian working class see martin hart landsberg the harsh reality of job growth in america reports from the economic front december 17 2019 of course the liberal think tanks who present such data though well intentioned are limited by capitalist ideology they typically end their studies with empty conclusions since any real solution to the trend toward devaluation of u s workers specifically putting the economy in the hands of the workers that create the wealth while ensuring that everyone who wants work has it

americans are feeling better about the economy a trend that if it continues could bolster president trump s prospects for re election in november forty percent of americans say they are better off financially than they were a year ago and just 19 percent say they are worse off according to a january survey conducted for the new york times by the online research firm surveymonkey that s the most positive that respondents have been about the economy in the three years the survey has been conducted other measures of consumer confidence have likewise shown a strong rebound in recent months after falling last summer amid headlines warning of a looming recession views of the economy remain sharply divided along partisan lines as they have throughout mr trump s presidency that could dampen the impact of the economy on the election because many voters may view economic news through the lens of their existing political preferences

release and is available on colgate s website joining me this morning are noel wallace president and chief executive officer and henning jakobsen chief financial officer i will begin with some thoughts on our performance in 2019 before moving to our 2020 guidance we made meaningful progress in 2019 on our path to returning to sustainable profitable growth as we said at the beginning of 2019 we increased investment behind our brands and in the capabilities that are required to deliver growth in our changing global markets we also implemented changes in how we work to streamline our processes and drive empowerment to make us faster those strategic choices have started to pay off as in 2019 we delivered net sales growth in excess of our initial guidance and organic sales growth at the high end of our initial 2019 guidance range of 2 to 4 and within our long term target range of 3 to 5 on a non gaap basis we delivered earnings per share within the guidance range we gave you at the beginning of the year while our gaap earnings per share were in excess of our initial guidance our free cash flow was up 7 in 2019 due to improved working capital performance and discipline on capital spending we delivered this performance despite some headwinds from economic uncertainty in markets like mexico brazil and india and importantly we delivered on our commitment to return to growth in china delivering organic sales growth in both the third and fourth quarters so how do we drive better growth in 2019 our continued focus on innovating around the core of our business driving growth in adjacent segments and expanding our availability in faster growth markets and channels is paying off we successfully relaunched several of our core franchises on colgate total we delivered that brand s fastest organic sales growth in several years led by key markets like the us brazil and mexico hill s continued to deliver strong growth with major contributions coming from the science diet relaunch in north america hill s delivered double digit growth in q4 while cycling a double digit comparison in the year ago period we have more core innovation to come in 2020 especially on key oral care and personal care brands our performance in faster growing adjacencies has been a significant contributor to our improvement in 2019 we delivered growth with new products that appeal to consumers preferences for products that are more natural and sustainable we ve driven sales and market share growth with our charcoal toothpaste and bamboo toothbrush launches around the world and sanex zero continues to grow as well in skin health eltamd and pca skin both achieved double digit sales growth for the year we acquired filorga in q3 and we are excited to announce that earlier today we closed our acquisition of the hello oral care brand these acquisitions should also contribute to growth going forward a quick note on filorga we are currently reporting filorga on a one month lag so the fourth quarter includes filorga results only from the closing of the deal in mid september through the end of november when we transition filorga to sap we will line up our reporting calendars our focus on availability in the faster growth markets and channels has seen us deliver very strong growth in pharmacy club cash and carry and especially e commerce our e commerce organic sales grew 30 in 2019 and we established a new direct to consumer business with hill s to home which provides the fast and easy way for veterinarians to sign patients up for prescription diet it s a new subscription model that increases compliance we are leveraging the learning from hill s new venture into our direct to consumer efforts across the rest of our businesses we also made significant inroads on sustainability during the year we launched the first of its kind recyclable toothpaste tube certified by the association of plastic recyclers which is now available in both europe and north america as of 2019 we have received true zero waste certification on 16 facilities and we earned our highest recognition ever from the dow jones worldwide sustainability index taking the lead in our industry sector for the first time our fourth quarter performance reinforces the progress that i just laid out we delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of sequential acceleration in organic sales growth and we returned to gross margin expansion and delivered leverage on our overhead on a gaap basis our gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was up 100 basis points excluding the impact of charges from our global growth and efficiency program and acquisition related costs our gross profit margin was up 80 basis points for the fourth quarter pricing was favorable to our gross margin by 60 basis points raw materials were unfavorable by 270 basis points almost entirely offset by productivity from our funding the growth initiatives of 260 basis points further primarily mix from filorga was favorable by 30 basis points our advertising spending was up 13 for the fourth quarter finishing up 6 5 for the full year in the fourth quarter excluding the charges from our global growth and efficiency program and advertising our sg a was down 70 basis points year over year as we benefited from operating leverage productivity savings and lower logistics costs so as we close the door on 2019 our focus is to advance on this progress through 2020 for 2020 we expect net sales growth of 4 to 6 driven by organic sales growth in the 3 to 5 range consistent with our long term targets a 1 to 2 benefit from the acquisitions of filorga and hello and a modest negative impact from foreign exchange we expect gross profit margin expansion in 2020 driven by the underlying business as well as the mix benefit from filorga we expect positive pricing and the continued strength of our productivity initiatives to more than offset modest raw materials inflation we will continue to invest behind our brands to maintain organic sales growth not just in terms of advertising which we expect to be up year over year but also in building key growth capabilities in areas like innovation and data and analytics we expect to drive leverage through the rest of our cost base through a combination of top line growth cost discipline productivity and mix these investments are crucial not only to sustain organic sales growth but also to get our market shares growing again our growth in non measured channels is very strong and this is a key part of the strategy we ve talked about all through 2019 so we are focused on improving our overall share performance this is particularly true in north america where we think a share turnaround in track channels is still a few quarters away accelerating our innovation efforts particularly in premium segments will be the key factor in delivering better market shares interest expense should be up slightly in the year due to the increased debt from filorga and the hello transactions we expect our tax rate to be between 24 5 and 25 5 on both the gaap basis and excluding acquisition costs on a gaap basis based on current spot rates we are planning for a mid to high single digit increase in earnings per share excluding charges resulting from the global growth and efficiency program acquisition related costs the benefit from a value added tax matter in brazil and the benefit from swiss income tax reform in 2019 based on current spot rates we are planning for a low to mid single digit increase in earnings per share at this point it seems certain that there will be a negative impact from the coronavirus on our businesses in china and the total company for at least the first quarter while we expect it to be temporary it is still too early to quantify the impact and therefore this is not been included in our guidance we expect to be in a position to provide an update at cagny as well as on our first quarter call we believe our plan for this year appropriately balances our improved performance our need to sustain organic sales growth our focus on driving cost out of our p l and the uncertainties that exist in a fairly volatile world and here to give you his thoughts on 2020 is noel noel wallace president and chief executive officer thanks john and happy new year everyone as john discussed we made meaningful progress in 2019 we grew volume and organic sales in every division we delivered organic sales growth in all four of our categories oral care personal care home care and pet nutrition in our oral care business we grew organic sales mid single digits in the year led by our toothpaste business and we closed out the year with our highest quarterly rate of organic sales growth in more than three years we know we re in 2020 now we have more work to do so here are my thoughts on our top three priorities for this year the first is premium innovation to drive growth we delivered successful innovation last year by focusing on our core adjacencies and new channels but markets categories consumer preferences are changing and premium is winning still a lot of opportunity for us in whitening lifestyle therapeutic new forms in pet like wet and importantly products that are more sustainable and more natural we re deeply excited about the hello acquisition given the potential we see for that brand on top of our core business and obviously skin health is a big area of opportunity for us lastly while we ve improved our speed of innovation we need to get faster we are aggressively cutting the time it takes innovation to reach the market and you ll see that play out over 2020 our second priority is becoming more digital and data driven in everything we do commercially continuing on innovation to get faster we need to use digital tools to replace our traditional testing methods in order to speed up our innovation we re using analytics to more effectively target our digital spending and drive a higher roi we re accelerating our e commerce business by becoming more data driven we re sharing learning across our businesses and geographies and we re co locating colgate and hill s businesses to share best practices and drive efficiencies and finally delivering productivity across the p l to new ways of working digital plays a part here as well projects like our global move to s 4hana will allow us to simplify and standardize processes and move resources toward areas that drive real growth in our supply chain we have opportunities for more automation and robotics to drive more savings and we are enhancing our productivity culture so our colgate employees can continue to deliver our best in class funding the growth program along with tackling other cost opportunities to drive efficiencies so those are our top three priorities we re focused on for 2020 more premium innovation to drive our growth digital and data to make us faster and smarter productivity to drive our margins and now i ll be happy to take any questions questions and answers operator and ladies and gentlemen today s question and answer session will be conducted electronically for the telephone audience we ll take our first question from steve strycula with ubs steve strycula ubs analyst hi good morning so my first question would be is how should we think about with the inclusion of new brands such as hello how do we think about your ability to manage category assortment within oral care as you kind of build it forward i think john mentioned desire to premiumize some of the north american business on his prepared remarks so how do we think about namesake colgate returning to growth in the united states and balancing that with growth platforms such as hello and tom s noel wallace president and chief executive officer yes steve thanks and good morning so clearly as you look at our portfolio around the world we have had a history of managing multiple brands and doing it quite successfully obviously the tom s brand here in the us has been a successful growth driver over the last couple of years and what s so exciting about the hello brand is given its positioning it really complements our entire portfolio extraordinarily well it s obviously on a lifestyle type brand and a feed farm type positioning skews very high among millennials and gen z where some of our other brands don t perform that well so as we look to manage this brand particularly in north america and around the world we think it s uniquely positioned in terms of delivering incremental growth to the core franchise as we you saw in 2019 we continued to accelerate oral care growth across the business and last year was one of the better years we ve had on oral care particularly in toothpaste and so we re very excited about what hello is going to bring to the business we ve shown historically we know how to integrate acquisitions and run brands and portfolios with multiple brands in them and that will be the case for us in 2020 with hello operator we ll go next to lauren lieberman with barclays lauren lieberman barclays analyst thanks good morning so very interesting that you did not give a gross margin target for 2020 so i wanted to know if you could just sort of address that change if we should think about that as maybe being a bit of a different approach at colgate whereas gross margins has always been held up as sort of a must have so if you can just talk a little bit about that that would be great thanks noel wallace president and chief executive officer sure good morning lauren listen there s a lot of unpredictability in the world that we live in today a lot of volatility whether it d be raw and packed materials whether it be foreign exchange a lot of mix play a lot of geographic mix play as well and while we still have laser focused on driving gross margin and as john outlined in his commentary we plan to grow gross margins in 2020 we felt it was important to really focus on the continued priority which is driving top line growth and delivering the eps guidance that we provided to the street this morning as far as gross margins go we believe the mix opportunities that we have obviously bringing brands like hello into the business the skincare focus we have all of those complementing our productivity funding the growth initiatives will allow us to continue to accelerate gross margins operator we ll take our next question from dara mohsenian with morgan stanley dara mohsenian morgan stanley analyst hi good morning guys noel wallace president and chief executive officer good morning dara mohsenian morgan stanley analyst we ve seen a clear rebound in organic sales growth of the company but so far it s been a bit uneven with pet in emerging markets business is accelerating substantially both for the full year but also in q4 but not a strong results in north america and europe so i was just hoping you could compare and contrast the impact from your strategy changes on those two separate areas is there anything you ve learned in emerging markets in pet you can apply it in north america and europe and any green shoots there in north america europe or when should we expect to see improvement particularly in light of the comments that the track channels in north america may take some time to turn thanks noel wallace president and chief executive officer thanks dara so let s take a step back on the overarching strategy that we ve been deploying over the last 12 to 18 months which is obviously focused on our core driving adjacencies and it s exploring and operating differently with our different channels and you ve seen that obviously play out in the acceleration of organic growth and as we said in the upfront statements we accelerated growth across all of our geographies all of our divisions in that regard and obviously all of our categories so we think the underlying strategy on how we re executing there around the world is doing quite well now obviously as you pull out different geographies europe categories are a bit slower different competitive base obviously we ve got a very strong business there with both the colgate franchise and the elmex franchise and the strategy that we just articulated we are executing really well there shares are pretty good across europe on our business and as we talked about earlier total performed very very well particularly in uk which is one of our largest market so overall we re optimistic on where we see europe going relative to some of the strategies we deployed but bear in mind the categories aren t growing nearly as fast in europe as they are in the rest of the world categories in emerging markets are basically in our categories growing at about 2x to the developed part of the world so again you would expect both north america and europe to be at a slower pace in terms of top line growth relative to north america obviously there s a lot of work being done from the team on how we re turning around that business we re clearly now at the potential that we see for that business as we speak we re very very focused on transforming how we think about innovation to be a lot more focused on premium as we go throughout the year most of that will be back half weighted the team under john s leadership is really rethinking on how we look at innovation from a structure standpoint how we look at it from a premium standpoint and we have some good r d technologies coming down the pipeline that we think will continue to accelerate growth but we re going to fix north america the right way obviously we re disappointed with the progress that we made in the fourth quarter but i have to say based on the plans i ve seen we re really encouraged on where they re going we re not going to buy our share back we re going to do things in terms of making sure that we have long term sustainable growth in that business and driving the premium piece of the business is the key focus operator we ll move next to jason english with goldman sachs jason english goldman sachs analyst hi good morning folks and happy belated new year i guess i want to come back to one of the pieces that are highlighted that s performing quite well and that s pet food really impressive growth i guess the key question is one of durability because it s been long time since we ve seen this type of growth we are hearing from tractor supply yesterday and i know they re not the hugest retailer but they re one of the more vocal ones that they re looking to reset their shelves and give some brands that have turned positive more space give us some of the legacy grain free brands less space are you seeing that same shift and do you expect it to benefit you and is there a reason to believe that we can continue to see this type of momentum as we track to 2020 noel wallace president and chief executive officer yes listen we re obviously very pleased as you ve seen in the numbers with hill s and this hearkens back to kind of the cornerstone of our strategy across the company which is focusing on the core which we ve seen terrific growth on science diet as we rolled out across north america we will be rolling the science diet relaunch we started in the late 2019 in europe and that will expand to the rest of the world in 2020 we looked at adjacencies obviously as we re gauging into the core and the channel expansion that we ve had both in farm and feed as well as e commerce really sits well with how confident we are with the strategy that we re executing around the world and specifically on the durability of that business aside from the fact that they continue to have a strong pipeline of innovation coming the science diet rollout will go throughout the rest of the world in 2020 take the us as an example we delivered double digit growth in the fourth quarter on the hill s business last year and we delivered another double digit growth this year in the fourth quarter so given the size of that business i think a clear indication that the durability is there now there s no question the comps will get more difficult as we move forward so we need to continue to focus on the things that we do really well which is the innovation piece of the business executing against new channels and exploring new adjacencies which i mentioned in some of my upfront comments about the opportunities we see in wet moving forward operator we ll move next to andrea teixeira with jpmorgan andrea teixeira jpmorgan analyst hi good morning everyone so i wanted to know if you can explore more you took us through europe and a bit of north america but as embedded in your guidance you re thinking of a more balanced growth in between north america and developing markets and if you can also elaborate a little bit more obviously we ve got the coronavirus impact but the asia pacific volumes have been coming back since last quarter since the third quarter and then the fourth quarter and if you continue to see momentum there and in latam if you can still see a more balanced volume pricing growth as you roll out the more premium products there thank you noel wallace president and chief executive officer thanks so let s talk a little bit about emerging markets as you well know we do 70 more or less 70 of our revenue is outside the us so we re very focused on emerging markets and as i mentioned earlier the emerging market growth rates at least in our core categories are growing at a healthy pace above where we see the developed part of the world moving so organic growth of 5 in emerging on the year versus 3 in developing obviously is consistent with what we like to see the profile of our organic growth moving forward given the strength that we have in emerging markets latin america specifically doing well mexico doing well and brazil categories are in the 4 to 5 rate there we should obviously there s some uncertainty on where mexico is going given the fact that they are technically in a recession and macroeconomics in brazil seem to be improving we ll see how that unfolds over time but the business is quite solid in latin america and the category seem to be holding up pretty well moving on to asia obviously very pleased with another quarter of organic growth and we seem to be getting on track but as we ve said the turnaround in asia is going to be it s going to take some time while we saw good growth in the back half of the year this is a long term strategy that we re executing in asia to get the portfolio right to get the go to market right and get the innovation structure right particularly as we look at how we innovate on the growing e commerce channel the coronavirus there s not much more to add on that first and foremost we re very pleased all of our employees are safe we are very focused on that we have mobilized the supply chain to look at all contingency planning relative to production should the implications of the virus extend beyond the current dates and we re intending to come back to everyone with more information at cagny africa is one we don t talk about a lot obviously we had issues in that business 18 months to 24 months ago you ve seen i think the durability of the strategy play out in the africa numbers where we ve seen consistent growth importantly one of our largest markets south africa had a good back half and so the categories as well as our business in that important geography seem to be performing quite well operator we ll take our next question from steve powers with deutsche bank steve powers deutsche bank analyst great thanks maybe first just a cleanup on north america i know you said you would buy your way back to share strength but the pricing and profitability this quarter just came in below our expectation so maybe you could help unpack what happened in the quarter and whether that will carry over into at least the first half of 2020 my main question more broadly just if you could maybe just the state of play across your skincare businesses in that category has been accelerating just love a little bit more context from you about how your various brands are performing against the expectations and then also just the comment on your appetite to do more in skin care whether prioritizing organic investment maybe expanding brands like tom s or even hello in that direction or obviously pursuing additional m a thanks noel wallace president and chief executive officer sure steve on the pricing bear in mind that in the fourth quarter of last year we were not promoting quite frankly at all across most of our toothpaste franchise given the preparation for the launch of total so the comps were obviously very difficult for us in the fourth quarter of this year versus where they were in the fourth quarter last year we also had a bit of mix both in the category and excuse me and channel mix has impacted the margins in the quarter moving forward as john mentioned in his comments the work that we re doing to prepare for long term sustainable growth in the us consistent with our strategy and very focused particularly in the us around premium innovation most of that will kick in in the back half of 2020 relative to skin care we re very pleased you heard in the upfront comments those businesses are growing double digits and we intend to continue to focus and accelerate our investment in those categories as we move through the balance of 2020 and they ve got a good innovation pipeline and we re obviously very carefully thinking about our expansion into new geographies what we do see is significant upside in geographies in which we currently compete obviously china is a big piece of the skincare business both for elta and for filorga so we ll have to we are on a wait and see in terms of the impact of the coronavirus on our business there filorga specifically has a good travel retail business so we ll see how that unfolds moving forward and as it relates to m a listen we ve got between elta pca and filorga we think the skincare assets right now obviously if something came across that really got our attention and we would consider it and with the acquisition of hello where we re tremendously excited in terms of the growth potential there we think we re right where we need to be in terms of m a but never say never operator we ll take our next question from nik modi with rbc nik modi rbc analyst yes good morning everyone noel i was hoping you can provide some compare and contrast i mean hill s has been doing very well after struggling for a bit and so i just wanted to hear your thoughts on what happened with hill s and kind of how you think about the oral care business in terms of kind of a progression and evolution of some of the strategies that you ve been putting in place john faucher senior vice president of investor relations sure again relative to the strategy that we re deploying across the world which is core adjacencies and channels hill s is hitting on all cylinders in that regard the other important area that we see that they have a unique advantage and it s how they re thinking about the business digitally and how we re focused very much on now embracing analytics to use to drive our e commerce business which was incidentally up almost 40 in the quarter so they re hitting on all of the right things right now and they ve got obviously good growth plans moving forward but as i ve said the comps get more difficult the good news is obviously the prescription diet a business which is an important part of that business we have strong innovation coming down in 2020 and we think we re well positioned obviously given some of the impacts of the recall that we had in 2019 to recover from that moving forward obviously relative to the learnings we have on hill s as i mentioned likewise in my upfront comments we re seeing great benefits by combining our teams particularly around digital and e commerce on the ground to share learnings and really maximize efficiencies in terms of how we look at digital how we buy digital and how we execute against the data that we re learning from that hill s is quite advanced in that and sharing those learnings broadly across the colgate business will pay dividends for us operator we ll go next to rob ottenstein with evercore isi rob ottenstein evercore isi analyst great thank you very much i think you mentioned e commerce overall up 30 hill s almost 40 can you perhaps kind of just give us a sense of what s going on in e commerce on the oral care side and particularly in the us market and in china what kind of growth rates you re seeing what percentage of the business is e commerce kind of initiatives you re doing and then most specifically on china you started to touch on it but love to get a little bit more granularity in terms of whether you have the right brand portfolio the right price points whether it s a question of technology relationships with the large e commerce providers to really get the chinese e commerce business rocking and rolling thank you noel wallace president and chief executive officer sure so pleased with the e commerce overall as john mentioned we were up 30 in the year this is a fluid business that you continually bring new learnings and which is great about the business because it s so data driven you re able to ascertain what s working what s not and act upon that pretty quickly so we re thinking quite differently among how we structure ourselves around e commerce with fully independent teams managing that business so they can take that they re empowered to make decisions and taking those decisions very live rather than having to wait for that so that s certainly benefiting us both on the oral care side the colgate side as well as hill s side the colgate business was up significantly last year in the us our e commerce business was up just shy of 40 our shares picked up again remember we have a very strong tom s of maine business hello will come into the franchise now which is quite strong on e commerce as well and the colgate business is driving nice growth as we look at china specifically we re starting to develop much more strategic relationships with some of the big platforms there whether it d be alibaba or jd we re looking at structuring ourselves differently in order to ensure that we re partnering with them in a very different way not only in terms of the data side of the business but likewise on the innovation side of business where we re going to need to really focus on the premium side which i mentioned and collaborating with some of our big partners and having the flexibility to do things a bit more uniquely we think will bode well for the business moving forward operator we ll take our next question from olivia tong with bank of america olivia tong bank of america analyst thanks first on north america just as you think about the remediation actions you re taking there what s your view on margins because they ve obviously come in pretty dramatically so you talked about the focus on premiumization do you think going forward the margin gets better because of the premiumization or is this sort of a certain level of investment is now here to stay noel wallace president and chief executive officer thanks olivia sure listen the margins improved in the fourth quarter obviously from where they were in the third quarter as i talked about we had some more difficult comparisons given the promotional environment a year ago we have seen a little bit of step up in promotional in the toothpaste category particularly around couponing as we ve seen some of our competitors increased their values in that space but we ll manage that very carefully as i mentioned earlier our focus is getting back to durable sustainable growth and premium innovation is at the heart of that and the premium innovation will obviously be accretive to the margin as we move forward and as we continue to push the mix in that area obviously the move toward naturals and lifestyle brands naturals with tom s of maine which will increase the investment behind that business will help margins the lifestyle brands like hello as we continue to push that business which incidentally today only has a 9 awareness in the us market so as we put more investment behind that and we continue to expand the distribution obviously that will play out nicely for the business as well the advertising is meant to obviously create long term sustainable growth for us and we ve seen that obviously play out holistically and globally on the top line and north america will get its fair share as we continue to rebuild that business moving forward but again we re going to do that the right way focused on innovation and making sure that we re building the brands for the long term operator we ll go next to kevin grundy with jefferies kevin grundy jefferies analyst thanks good morning everyone question for you on the company s ability to drive greater leverage between the top line and earnings as we look beyond 20 so clearly this was an investment year you re getting the top line payback which is encouraging but eps down mid single digits as you look out to next year up low to mid single digits relatively in line with the mid single digit excuse me low single excuse me mid single digit top line that you re guiding to organically understanding fx is a little bit of a component there a little bit of a headwind but will investment levels be adequate for the company as best you can tell as you look at your budget and you look at your guidance now so as you get beyond 20 should the investment community expect a return to high single digit eps growth where you re able to get better leverage once investment levels are adequate thanks noel wallace president and chief executive officer yes thanks kevin we re not going to obviously guide beyond 2020 at this stage but let me talk a little bit about leverage and productivity and how we re thinking about it first and foremost as we ve been very consistent with our strategy around reinvigorating top line growth and driving sustainable organic growth you ve seen now obviously sequentially through the last five quarters and the best leverage we re going to get through the p l is as we deliver the top line obviously we ll see where foreign exchange goes we believe it will be a little less punishing it has been in the past this year but again with the unpredictability of the environment that we compete we shall see as i mentioned in the upfront beyond premium innovation which will obviously drive the top line and the leverage to the p l we are very very focused on productivity across the entire p l we have a list of projects that we re thinking through we re obviously looking at productivity delivered some technology in the discussions i had around s 4hana and how we leverage the simplification efforts that will come from that and the standardization that will come from that so we re very focused on that the supply chain likewise looking as i mentioned to use robotics and automation very differently moving forward we re looking at segmentation of our facilities around the world to drive more efficiencies in the plants so productivity is right in our focus right now and as we drive the top line we ll see that productivity move through the p l most of that productivity particularly for north america we ll see that coming through in the back half of 2020 operator we ll move next to mark astrachan with stifel mark astrachan stifel analyst thanks and good morning everybody wanted to ask about hello kind of specifically in m a strategy broadly so what is hello give you that you couldn t have done with your own brands and i guess just more broadly what s driving the increase in m a over the last year or so as you ve taken over now how do you describe the company s ability to handle digest multiple deals and once i get that they re small but there s a lot more going on here than there has been thoughts on doing more deals can you to take on more at this point potentially even something larger should that materialize and maybe how do you think about the leverage target and are not necessarily specific to m a which is kind of broadly since there s certainly on a lot of leverage on the balance sheet at this point noel wallace president and chief executive officer yes so thanks mark so i mentioned upfront that markets are changing categories are changing consumers are changing and we ve seen that disruption certainly peak out very aggressively in asia and particularly china and we ve seen a lot more of that in north america over the last 18 months and so as we look at our business we re obviously looking to position our brands in areas where they can best compete and as we look at our portfolio strategies we obviously can t be a one brand for all particularly given the disruptions you re seeing in the marketplace and if we see the right opportunity for complementary brands within our portfolio particularly in oral care we will seek to go after those and hello was a perfect perfect fit for us relative to its unique positioning in terms of millennials and gen z which is now the strength of the colgate franchise it obviously complement itself very well with tom s hello is a very lifestyle oriented brand where tom s is a very core natural oriented brand so we think it fits well and we re going to run the business independently we re going to run the business differently and now bring it into the colgate business so we re very fortunate to have craig and lauri coming over to the business i think some of you have met them you know the strength of their leadership you know the strength of their marketing instincts and how they think about brands we fully intend to use both of them across the colgate business around the world to help us think about innovation very very differently and i think craig will be a wonderful ambassador for us as we think about how we re transforming our innovation approach to the market as i mentioned earlier we re very comfortable with the m a that we ve made where we continue to be able to deliver against those we have a track record of delivering successfully against m a and i think the reason is we re very focused we let the businesses run independently we maintain their cultures but we offer them all the opportunities to flex the colgate machine so to speak relative to synergies and best practices training you name it and that we ll continue to do that with hello operator we ll move next to bill chappell with suntrust bill chappell suntrust analyst thanks good morning taking a year to look back on the total relaunch especially in north america but also kind of worldwide i mean what would be your grade of it just from the super bowl commercial to the money spent there and i understand that it was in part done you needed to kind of restage the platform before you rolled out new products this year but just trying to understand especially in light of kind of the fourth quarter north american results how good was this in line with the expectations to the money that s spent elsewhere just kind of your color would be great noel wallace president and chief executive officer yes thanks bill so listen we took a 10 price increase on that business and we held that price increase through the year and if you take a big core franchise like colgate total that s probably the best pricing performance we ve had in the better part of the decade so from a pricing standpoint we re quite excited we ve had the fastest growth on colgate total in over three years so that and its own suggest that the relaunch was successful did we have slightly higher expectations in certain geographies sure but in our big markets like the uk like brazil like mexico where we have high shares we did very well north america perhaps under delivered against our expectation our volume share was ok but recall we downsized that brand and then perhaps we would have done a little bit differently given some of the learnings we have through the launch but overall it drove the brand it drove the equity and we had a good year on oral care operator we ll take our next question from ali dibadj with bernstein ali dibadj bernstein analyst hi guys thanks so regarding your hi regarding your 2020 guidance i d love to better understand kind of the lack of top line growth leveraging into your bottom line and if you back it out it feels like it would suggest something like another up to 100 basis points call it maybe 75 basis points of reinvestment into the business again in 2020 and so in that context i d love to get a sense of how you assess the return on that spend given what you ve seen so far in 2019 particularly on the market share the market share continues to decline as you put it out in your press release not getting better you still have the us brazil mexico france china india kind of your core areas still losing share so love to hear how you think about the returns in that overall context noel wallace president and chief executive officer well let me take the latter part of your question first i think the returns in the results ali obviously a 5 organic in the fourth quarter sequentially up from the fourth and as we met as we ve discussed and you have highlighted it for quite some time the need to continue to invest behind the business we think with that played out relative to the organic performance that we delivered on the 2020 guide obviously just a couple of mechanics through the p l the filorga as a full year on a percent of sales advertising obviously much higher and adding a bit to the overall advertising line but as we mentioned upfront we have a strong focus on premium innovation and we want to continue to accelerate the investment behind our brands in our businesses in order to deliver long term sustainable growth it s early days right now obviously we ve got a lot of work to do with this year it s only january a lot can change relative to the macro as you see lot of uncertainty we ll see where china plays out brazil mexico likewise as i mentioned earlier india a little bit of softness obviously in the real markets we see so we think the guidance from where we are today and where we sit is absolutely appropriate in terms of how we re thinking about the business and as we move throughout the year we ll continue to update that as necessary operator we ll take our final question today from lauren lieberman with barclays lauren lieberman barclays analyst great thank you i just wanted to follow up on asia in general not seeking about outlook for china and coronavirus in particular at all but it when you look back asia had the best volume performance i think since 2015 and the best pricing performance since 2014 so just at a holistic level if you could talk a little bit about sort of again ex coronavirus sustainability and what types of things have really triggered that uptick and if you re thinking about that as being like a new base level for the kind of performance you can have out of the region thanks noel wallace president and chief executive officer thanks lauren there was also an earlier question on our portfolio in china i remind the audience that we obviously have the colgate franchise and the darlie franchise that delivers our leadership market position in china both those businesses continue to perform well particularly the darlie business came back nicely in the fourth quarter was able to launch again focused on our strategy premium innovation particularly around some you d be surprised to hear baking solar products that have now become a very very popular in china and are being sold the premium prices and that certainly helped deliver now in the pricing but the volume on the colgate side as i mentioned earlier we re in the midst of a long term turnaround here we still got a lot of work to do relative to that business we re pleased with where we saw the business perform we had a good 11 11 again behind premium pricing our miracle repair product our volcanic products that we launched in the quarter delivered good volume and good pricing as you look outwards obviously we ll see the impact of corona and what happens in china is going to be very difficult at this point to predict the sustainability of where we are right now given the implications of that but we re certainly structuring ourselves and putting the fundamentals in place to deliver long term sustainable growth in those markets operator and at this time i ll turn it back to management for any additional or closing remarks noel wallace president and chief executive officer so thank you everyone obviously we ll see everyone at cagny i look forward to having more discussions there and for all the colgate people that are listening let me wholeheartedly thank you for your incredible support and work for the last year and we look forward to your continued focus in 2020 thanks everyone operator duration 46 minutes call participants john faucher senior vice president of investor relations noel

by northmantrader in real life you can always tell when someone has something to hide when they get really evasive in their answers and boy was jay powell evasive in his press conference yesterday twice he was asked about the fed s policies causing risk assets to rise twice he skirted with a non answer powell on whether not qe is boosting markets it s very hard to say what is affecting financial markets with any precision or confidence jeanna smialek jeannasmialek january 29 2020 he may as well have said that asset prices work in mysterious ways it was a complete copout and dodge and therefore the non answer was very revealing in itself look i can t believe we still have debates on this issue there are still fed apologists out there in apparent denial beating the drum that nothing the fed does causes risk assets to rise directly the fed just manages the economy via interest rates and liquidity does not go directly into stocks it s just the underlying economic conditions and earnings growth that causes stocks to rise please just stop who are you going to believe the fed or your own lying eyes and of course we can point to 2019 when earnings dropped and stocks flew higher on nothing but a constant fed jawboning and policy operation with jay powell personally marking the lows during each correction i don t want to rehash the debate arguing why the earth is not flat with flat earthers and i don t need to jay powell s non answer was the answer if the fed s policy wasn t causing asset prices to rise he could ve just flat out denied it instead he muddled in generalities which tells me one thing he didn t want to go on the record because he knows it s true but he can t admit it hence my point yesterday bottomline powell dodged the most important question are the fed s policies causing risk asset prices to rise above where they otherwise would be he knows they are but can t admit it and that makes the fed an inherent dishonest organization sven henrich northmantrader january 29 2020 the fed is a dishonest organization i can go further and call it the big fed lie the lie that asset prices are not directly on the fed s mind when managing policy go no further then watch bill dudley in its vehement denial that repo impacts asset prices directly we already discussed this here repo lightning admitting the very point the fed is indeed watching asset prices in determining policy the fed s balance sheet expansion is not fueling the stock market says former new york fed president bill dudley he speaks to ferrotv ahead of the fed s first 2020 policy meeting t co f2n4jsjgjs pic twitter com ywbyawywhi bloomberg tv bloombergtv january 29 2020 he literally said they the fed certainly have to consider the financial asset prices when making their monetary policy decisions and there it is and they do does the fed think we re stupid or are they in self denial we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us in yesterday s press conference powell listed every possible reason for a slowing of global growth in 2018 except of course the real reason that central banks reduced liquidity and stocks tanked as a result which slumped confidence and spending the linkage between stock market direction and economic growth was even acknowledged by bill dudley in the interview above the effect is obvious stocks drop hard and confidence takes a hit spending slows the economy slows stocks rise confidence goes up spending increases the economy grows nothing magical about that and hence the real incentive for the fed is to manage the economy via the stock market and put in the conditions for the market to rise and liquidity easy financial conditions do the job what you think it s a coincidence that the fed is running the loosest financial conditions in 27 years right now the fed with 3 rates cuts qe and repo has now brought about the loosest financial conditions in the entire cycle and the loosest financial conditions in 27 years pic twitter com g89zxqkjgt sven henrich northmantrader january 23 2020 of course not here s the truth the fed can t and won t admit the near 20 drop in stocks in q4 2018 scared them their effort to normalize rates and the balance sheet ended in failure and a sustained drop in stocks would ve brought a further slow down in economic activity and have risked a recession so they flipped and they flopped and went full easy again and kicked the can further down the road exacerbating asset prices in the process and when the repo crisis happened out of the blue they panicked and flushed the system with liquidity and it s brought about a massive further acceleration in asset prices let s even stipulate for argument s sake that the liquidity does not make it into stocks directly i think this is very debatable but if money is chasing stocks because the perception is that the fed is supporting markets that s then a learned behavior producing the same effect in short they have created a market monster that demands constant feeding driving the very behavior that they are unwilling to admit some call it a communication problem i call it a policy failure a market and economy made permanently dependent on central bank intervention with central banks unable to extract themselves while the world is ever more drowning in debt but worse for the fed now hardly anybody believes them not on liquidity not on repo not on inflation guy adami brought up a very good point yesterday fed wants 2 inflation 1 be careful what you wish for 2 if they measured inflation with actual things that impact our lives they would realize we are well north of that 3 they re screwed and they know it or they re screwed and they re too arrogant to see it guy adami guyadami january 29 2020 the fed may publicly pretend to not target asset prices they may claim inflation not to exit when every consumer experiences it they may pretend ignorance and imply that stock prices move in mysterious ways they may even pretend that valuations are not at extremes powell valuations are high but not at extremes t co orl9qlhtyt pic twitter com windokv9x9 sven henrich northmantrader january 29 2020 they may pretend ignorance on all these things but we know better and the market knows better for every wall street firm with a bullish outlook cites the fed s policy actions as a primary reason to buy stocks there is of course a reason why the fed can t and won t admit to any of it and that is they have been largely responsible for the last 2 stock market busts and are setting everyone up here for the next one future history books the fed s loose money policies contributed to the year 2000 market bubble the fed s loose money policies contributed to the year 2007 housing bubble the fed s loose money policies contributed to the year 2020 market credit debt bubble sven henrich northmantrader january 29 2020 and that makes them the villain i will say again for emphasis amongst the many villains of the 21st century central bankers specifically our federal reserve will go down as some of the most destructive guy adami guyadami january 30 2020 instead of coming clean they are unwilling to admit it to themselves and or to the public instead they keep peddling the big fed lie it s very hard to say what is affecting financial markets with any precision or confidence bullshit
new york over the last decade the world economy has experienced a steady build up of debt now amounting to 230 per cent of global gdp the last three waves of debt caused massive downturns in economies across the world the first of these happened in the early 1980s after a decade of low borrowing costs which enabled governments to expand their balance sheets considerably interest rates began to rise making debt service increasingly unsustainable mexico fell first informing the united states government and the international monetary fund in 1982 that it could no longer repay this had a domino effect with 16 latin american countries and 11 least developed countries outside the region ultimately rescheduling their debts in the 1990s interest rates were again low and global debt surged once more the crash came in 1997 when fast growing but financially vulnerable east asian economies including indonesia malaysia south korea and thailand experienced sharp growth slowdowns and plummeting exchange rates the effects reverberated worldwide but it is not only emerging economies that are vulnerable to such crashes as america s 2008 subprime mortgage crisis proved by the time people figured out what subprime meant the us investment bank lehman brothers had collapsed triggering the most severe crisis and recession since the great depression the world bank has just warned us that a fourth debt wave could dwarf the first three emerging economies which have amassed a record debt to gdp ratio of 170 per cent are particularly vulnerable as in the previous cases the debt wave has been facilitated by low interest rates there is reason for alarm once interest rates begin to rise and premia inevitably spike the mechanics of such crises are not well understood but a 1998 paper by stephen morris and hyun song shin on the mysterious origins of currency crises and how they are transmitted to other economies shows that a financial tsunami can make landfall far from its source how the source of financial trouble can vanish leaving others stranded was illustrated in the delightful short story rnam krttva by the celebrated twentieth century indian writer shibram chakraborty in the story which i translated into english and included in my book an economist s miscellany the desperate shibram asks an old school friend harsha to lend him 500 rupees 7 on a wednesday to be repaid the following saturday but shibram squanders the money so on saturday he has little choice but to ask another school friend gobar for a loan of 500 rupees to be repaid the next wednesday he uses the money to repay harsha but when wednesday rolls around he has no way of repaying gobar so reminding harsha of his excellent repayment record he borrows from him again this becomes a routine with shibram repeatedly borrowing from one friend to repay the other then shibram runs into both harsha and gobar one day at a crosswalk after a moment of anxiety he has an idea every wednesday he suggests harsha should give gobar 500 rupees and every saturday gobar should give the same amount to harsha shibram assures his former school friends that this will save him a lot of time and change nothing for them and he vanishes into kolkata s milling crowds so who are the likely harshas and gobars in today s debt wave according to the world bank they could be any country with domestic vulnerabilities a stretched fiscal balance sheet and a heavily indebted population there are several countries that fit this description and run the risk of being the conduit that carries the fourth debt wave to the world economy among advanced economies the united kingdom is an obvious candidate in 2019 the uk narrowly avoided a recession with a growth rate a shade above zero the weakest growth in a non recession period since 1945 the country is also about to undertake brexit conservatives in britain have promised that a tidal wave of business investment will follow this is unlikely if there is a tidal wave it will probably be one of debt instead among emerging economies india is especially vulnerable in the 1980s india s economy was fairly sheltered so the debt wave back then had little impact at the time of the east asian crisis in 1997 india had just begun to open up and it experienced some slowdown in growth by the time of the debt wave in 2008 the country had become globally integrated and was severely affected but its economy was strong and growing at nearly 10 per cent annually and it recovered within a year today india s economy is facing one of its deepest crises in the last 30 years with growth slowing sharply unemployment at a 45 year high close to zero export growth over the last six years and per capita consumption in the agricultural sector decreasing over the last five years add to this a deeply polarised political environment and it is little wonder that investor confidence is rapidly declining it is not too late for countries to build seawalls to protect against debt tsunamis while india s political problems will take time to solve the union budget is an opportunity for preemptive action the fiscal deficit needs to be controlled in the medium term but the government would be wise to adopt expansionary fiscal policy now with money channeled into shoring up infrastructure and investment managed properly this can boost demand without increasing inflationary pressures and strengthen the economy in order to withstand a debt wave the country s leaders must seize this opportunity the alternative is to adopt the brace position kaushik

the associated contractors of america agc is optimistic about residential and commercial construction expecting modest increases in both residential construction spending 2 to 7 and nonresidential private and public spending 0 to 4 each in 2020 predicting the future is not an exact science and with all of the variables surrounding 2020 it can be downright challenging to plan for the upcoming year equipment today turned to four industry insiders to share their view of market conditions while they may have different takes on how the overall industry segments may perform their insights can help you formulate your own action plan for the coming months two of the industry insiders are confident in continued strength in the commercial and housing construction market while the other two predict small declines not all of the segments in this market category will perform equally with retail space and hotels ranking among the weaker segments power energy and warehouses may have more upside potential let s look at the economic fundamentals there are two major factors at work says anirban basu chief economist associated builders and contractors abc the first is the strength of america s consumer spending led economy now in its 11th year of economic expansion much of the strength in the economy can be observed in the behavior of the labor market which continues to churn out net new jobs in large numbers this has the effect of expanding demand for space of various types whether in the form of fulfillment centers or office buildings the other major source of impact is the shockingly low cost of capital previous forecasts regarding interest rates have missed the mark economists had predicted that interest rates would be much higher by now but rather than rising in 2019 interest rates declined for the most part basu explains this helped produce a recent surge in single family building permits and the highest home builder confidence in about 20 years construction industry stakeholders remain upbeat about the first half of 2020 according to abc s construction confidence index more than 60 of contractors expect sales to rise over the next six months the implication is that there should be plenty of spending in both residential and commercial construction segments this year says basu ken simon son chief economist associated contractors of america agc is also optimistic about residential and commercial construction i expect modest increases in both residential construction spending 2 to 7 and nonresidential private and public spending 0 to 4 each in 2020 the most promising markets are single family housing and power and energy especially wind and solar projects and pipelines each of these markets should increase by 5 to 10 but not all segments of commercial construction look bright the outlook remains bleak for retail construction 15 or more following a 25 decline in 2019 and fragile for manufacturing projects many of which have been put on hold because of uncertainty over trade policy says simonson richard branch chief economist for dodge data analytics expects starts in both the residential and commercial building markets to settle back in 2020 on the residential side single family units will slip 5 while multifamily units are expected to fall 15 he states despite strong demand single family construction continues to suffer from weak affordability and a significant lack of supply of entry level affordable units that will persist into 2020 multifamily construction meanwhile has seen aggressive growth over the past several years fueled by high value projects in major urban areas such as new york miami and los angeles he continues however slowing economic growth in 2020 will lead to less hiring and downward pressure on multifamily starts branch forecasts commercial starts will decline 6 in 2020 to 119 5 billion hotel and warehouse starts will show the largest pullbacks down 11 and 10 respectively as real estate fundamentals in both markets show signs of bottoming out the office market meanwhile will post the mildest drop down just 2 next year as growth in data center construction somewhat offsets weakness in the traditional office market ihs markit expects commercial construction spending to finish 2019 substantially lower following double digit average annual growth from 2011 to 2018 the pullback in construction activity for 2019 has been most notable in the retail and warehouse segments which fell 28 and 7 respectively says katherine smith director of public relations construction of retail buildings has plummeted largely because the retail industry is scaling back the development of brick and mortar retail spaces as the industry undergoes changes and shifts toward e commerce activity she adds the rise of e commerce had been a boon to warehouse construction which rose an average of 22 annually from 2010 through 2018 however warehouse construction spending declines in 2019 can partially be attributed to weak business investment related to uncertainty around trade related tariff concerns looking to 2020 ihs markit expects commercial construction to fall further with spending forecast to be 6 5 lower than in 2019 the decline is expected to be widespread but most notably in office and lodging segments which account for 60 of all commercial construction spending says smith spending on office building construction is expected to decline 4 and lodging construction spending is expected to fall 7 like 2019 anemic business investment is expected to be the drag on commercial construction ihs markit also expects residential construction to finish 2019 lower with spending falling an estimated 9 for the year despite declining mortgage rates single family construction spending has been the biggest drag on residential construction activity falling 10 for the year says smith one significant headwind to single family construction in 2019 and into 2020 is the un affordability of housing to many potential home buyers rising prices as well as the rising cost of building a home has caused home builders to construct larger homes that fall outside of most potential home buyers price point she continues in 2020 residential construction spending is expected to be relatively flat with a decline in single family construction offsetting 5 growth in improvement spending according to ihs markit public construction spending in the u s experienced healthy growth in 2019 despite a decline in private construction spending during the year the rise in public construction spending can be largely attributed to a number of infrastructure projects that state and local governments initiated during the year that they had put off while waiting for an infrastructure plan from the trump administration and congress says smith because a plan never came to fruition states and localities started a number of projects specifically highways and streets projects that caused public infrastructure construction spending to rise during the year going into 2020 ihs markit expects overall public construction spending to be relatively flat for the year while state and local entities are leading the charge there is some uncertainty over federal funding in 2020 the fast act expires in september and as of this time there is no new legislation to extend surface transportation funding the bright spots for the year will be public healthcare building spending forecast to rise 7 and state and local spending on highways and streets construction and water and sewer construction with expected increases of 2 and 8 respectively predicts smith it is notable that in 2019 the state of illinois passed a 45 billion infrastructure plan which is expected to result in public construction in these segments beginning in 2020 in contrast spending on public transportation and government buildings is forecast to pull down growth for 2020 basu remains optimistic about infrastructure spending there is little reason to believe that infrastructure spending will soften in 2020 he says according to abc s construction backlog indicator the infrastructure category has improved more than any other construction segment during the first 10 months of 2019 state and local government finances continue to be in solid shape driven by a combination of higher income retail and property tax collections notes basu that leaves more money available for infrastructure investment moreover low interest rates make it advantageous for governments to float bonds to finance substantial infrastructure outlays among the categories of infrastructure expected to experience the fastest rate of growth in construction spending are water systems public safety and roads and bridges presuming that congress manages to address the impending insolvency of the nation s highway trust fund he adds simonson believes the strongest public categories are likely to be highway and street construction and transportation especially transit and airports the cumulative impact of several years of state fuel tax increases wider use of tolling voter and legislative approval of transit bond issues and growing air travel should ensure sufficient funding to boost spending on these categories even though congress is unlikely to approve new federal funds for infrastructure he says branch predicts public construction will benefit in 2020 from the stability of government funding for projects institutional building construction starts which include projects such as schools hospitals and airline terminals will remain essentially flat at 142 5 billion he forecasts the strength in the institutional market will be in education buildings and healthcare starts will rise 2 and 3 respectively education activity will benefit from moderate demographic growth in the k 12 population while aging baby boomers provide strength to the healthcare market he adds public works starts streets highways bridges water sewer etc will increase 4 in 2020 to 164 3 billion as federal funding for transportation and water projects moves slightly higher trade agreements could ease material pricing pressure pricing pressure is usually linked to supply and demand with construction starts only expected to post a mild pullback in 2020 material pricing pressure should remain a significant issue says branch that however will be offset somewhat by an easing in trade uncertainty due to the agreement on the usmca united states mexico canada agreement and the phase one trade deal between the u s and china wage pressures will also remain acute next year due to the significant shortage of skilled labor in the construction industry there are geopolitical risks as well as always volatility in the middle east can cause abrupt price increases for oil affecting diesel fuel and asphalt purchased directly by contractors as well as the fuel cost they pay in freight bills for delivering materials and equipment and for debris removal says simonson at the moment there appears to be reasonable supply demand balance for most materials but agreements that remove tariffs or the imposition of higher tariffs could cause sudden significant price changes for steel aluminum copper and lumber a recovering global market could drive up demand after a rather weak 2019 the global economy appears to be firming says basu this is due in large measure to stimuli being offered by policymakers in china europe the united states and elsewhere the implication is that commodity prices are likely to rise in 2020 producing higher construction materials prices the first phase trade deal with china and the new usmca agreement further support this narrative since each stand to reduce the level of economic uncertainty facing various decision makers thereby supporting more rapid and stable global economic growth he continues issues between the united states and iran as well as commitments by opec nations to cut oil output have helped to push oil prices in north america past the 60 mark as 2020 begins the pricing and purchasing group at ihs markit anticipates construction material prices to increase slightly in aggregate for 2020 while some raw material prices are still searching for bottom others are beginning to see moderate price increases says smith we have characterized the environment in supply chains as clearly favoring buyers for the past six months however we believe a subtle shift is beginning manufacturing activity is stabilizing after slowing globally for the past 18 months she adds improvement in physical demand will be accompanied by a degree of inventory restocking providing a modest boost to apparent consumption the slow tightening in markets will become apparent during the next four quarters with pricing leverage between buyers and goods producers becoming more balanced by the second half of 2020 recent trade policy developments have proven favorable relieving some uncertainties and supporting ihs markit s view of moderate price growth the mexican senate approved the amended usmca and following congressional ratification the agreement was recently signed into law by president trump the next step is ratification in the canadian parliament which should occur in 2020 the primary upside risk to the forecast is the reversal of the phase one trade deal between the u s and china defined as china excluding taiwan hong kong sar and macao sar this agreement rolls back not only some of the tariffs between the two countries but lays the framework for a broader phase two agreement that would lower or eliminate them entirely smith points out most important perhaps even a phase one agreement removes some of the guesswork that has been inhibiting business planning and thereby slowing growth a risk going forward is a collapse in phase two negotiations over some of the contentious issues such as chinese state subsidies avoided in the phase one deal she comments such an outcome that reimposes tariffs or brings new higher tariffs rates would mean higher costs and in turn prices for construction raw materials

rough estimate puts cost of 25 year whitmer road debt well above 1 billion state has money to fix roads now without borrowing the michigan state transportation commission wasted no time in voting to approve a first installment on gov gretchen whitmer s plan to borrow 3 5 billion for road repairs news stories cited officials estimating that the borrowing will take place over four years with loans extending some 25 years at interest rates between 2 5 and 3 5 a highly simplified analysis gives a rough idea of what this will mean for taxpayers if 3 5 billion were borrowed all at once at 3 0 and paid off gradually over 25 years the state would incur total interest expenses of around 1 45 billion if the state used transportation tax revenue to make monthly payments on the debt borrowing this year would subtract nearly 200 million per year from the amount available for road fixes and other transportation spending over the next quarter century the actual cost will be different and likely lower but this gives an idea of the magnitude two weeks before whitmer announced she would go to the bond market for road dollars sen roger victory r hudsonville introduced senate bill 716 that put a limit on state borrowing it would prohibit the transportation commission from issuing more than 100 million in bond debt unless it gives legislators a 30 days notice if the bill were enacted it would also allow the legislature to halt the debt issuance with a majority vote in the house and senate the bill was referred to the senate appropriations committee on jan 14 given this week s events and the fact that the governor would have to sign the bill it will not become law the media meanwhile continues to report that without some type of new revenue the state is doing nothing to fix the roads the detroit free press reported commission chairman todd wyett citing studies that show that without action some highways will be beyond repair said if we do not do something about our major trunk lines they will go over a cliff and it s not recoverable but taxpayers have already been doing an increased amount of something about roads for the past several years at the end of 2015 lawmakers increased vehicle registration taxes and motor fuel taxes both taking effect in 2017 projections showed that the registration tax increase would bring in at least 226 million more for roads in 2020 and the gas tax increase another 298 million faster than expected economic growth means the actual revenue increases are probably higher the senate fiscal agency projects that when the 2019 20 fiscal year ends on sept 30 the state will have an unspent balance of 897 million with simple majority votes in the state house and senate and the governor s approval all or some of this could be spent on road repairs this year with a new infusion of debt funded cash however that is unlikely most of the state revenue that goes to road repairs is allocated to the state transportation fund the fund s revenue in the 2011 12 fiscal was the equivalent of 2 3 billion in 2019 dollars projections for the current fiscal year say that the fund will receive a total of 3 6 billion in taxes a 57 increase rise over eight years when adjusted for inflation
despite thailand having the largest amount of novel coronavirus cases outside of china the thai economy was sick even before the virus outbreak unfortunately the export reliant 500 billion thai economy has been plagued by a strong baht and us china trade war now add in beijing s newly imposed restrictions on chinese travelers who account for the lion s share of arrivals plus the knock on effect on other tourists and a recession begins to look imminent thailand has lagged its southeast asian neighbors for some time while political upheaval has been a major drag there are others too an aging population poor productivity flat lining consumption and hefty household debt the central bank now expects gdp growth of 2 5 for 2019 that s considerably worse than even lackluster peers like malaysia and indonesia and the country s weakest pace since 2014 the year a military junta took power exports also shrank in 2019 with shipments in the key car making industry declining thailand is a regional hub for vehicle manufacturers like nissan motor co which have been affected by poor demand in major markets such as china bloomberg reports the high baht hurt thai economy the thai currency outperformed last year despite policymakers efforts on the back of a yawning current account surplus weak inflation and near record foreign exchange reserves the baht s recent weakening has been one of the few positive side effects of the coronavirus epidemic in november thailand relaxed rules on capital outflows to ease upward pressure but central bank officials know that too much tinkering in the market could prompt washington to label it a currency manipulator meanwhile fiscal stimulus including an infrastructure drive was held up by wrangling around the 2020 government budget an interest rate cut this coming week to a record low of 1 looks likely which will also affect the thai economy so the year had already started poorly now with 19 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus most of them chinese travelers and the illness spreading fast it looks a whole lot worse in the third quarter the economy expanded only 0 1 compared to the previous three months analysts say fourth quarter numbers reported this month could show a slip into negative territory a further contraction in the first three months of 2020 would put thailand into a technical recession the first and most direct factor is tourism depending on how you measure it the industry accounts for roughly a fifth of thailand s gdp visitor numbers were already depressed by the strong baht which made other tropical destinations cheaper chinese tourists who were supposed to flock back as the impact of a 2018 boat disaster waned were trickling in only slowly china s tour ban that makes china s restrictions to contain the pandemic all the more painful on jan 24 travel agencies were ordered to stop selling tour packages overseas while many more chinese now venture abroad alone roughly half still go with groups thailand s finance ministry warned last wednesday that the virus and related bans could have a three month impact meaning 400 000 fewer visitors tourism authorities have forecast an even steeper chinese drop for thailand that s more than a peak season blow china accounts for the largest number of visitors some 11 million traveled last year according to thai authorities they also splurge more per head than any other nationality amounting to an estimated total of almost 18 billion in 2019 that s just over a quarter of spending by overseas visitors as reported by thailand s tourism authority consider the knock on effect on other nationalities and it becomes clear why citigroup inc analysts have cut their expected increase in tourist numbers for 2020 to 0 5 from 6 5 there are also harder to measure second order impacts like the impact of slower chinese growth on the wider region on global growth and on trade consumption will suffer thai economy reliant on chinese tourism the experience of severe acute respiratory syndrome which brought the region to its knees in 2003 offers some consolation back then the most affected economies including hong kong bounced back quickly by august 2003 hong kong arrivals were back at pre sars levels thanks to rules that made it easier for mainland travelers to cross the border china appears to have moved more swiftly this time its also better equipped and this virus appears less deadly but the scale of the epidemic is still hard to measure both china and tourism account for a far larger slice of thailand s economy than ever before add in a crippling drought and budget troubles have delayed much needed fiscal stimulus to go with lower interest rates thai stocks marked their steepest drop since 2016 last monday it s hard to argue that pessimism is overdone source bloomberg

chief executive officer thanks beth good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today this morning weyerhaeuser reported a full year net loss of 76 million or 0 10 per diluted share driven by a previously reported 0 47 non cash pension settlement charge excluding special items our full year 2019 earnings totaled 285 million or 0 39 per share for the fourth quarter we reported a gaap loss of 14 million or 0 02 per diluted share excluding net charges of 37 million for special items we earned 23 million or 0 03 per diluted share for the quarter throughout 2019 all of our businesses executed well despite significant headwinds from sluggish housing activity in the first half of the year persistently challenged commodity prices and continued global trade uncertainty i m extremely proud of our accomplishments in 2019 which included achieving record low controllable manufacturing costs in our lumber and oriented strand board operations capturing over 100 million of operational excellence improvements delivering the highest ebitda ever from our real estate energy and natural resources business to delivering a 61 premium to timber value from real estate sales strategically optimizing portions of our northern timberlands portfolio for total proceeds of nearly 450 million reducing our pension obligations by 1 5 billion and returning over 1 billion of cash to shareholders before i dive into our fourth quarter business results let me set the stage with some brief remarks on the housing market the improved pace of us housing activity that emerged during the third quarter continued steadily through year end building activity in december was particularly strong for the year us housing starts totaled 1 29 million a 3 improvement compared with the year ago looking forward economic fundamentals support continued growth in us housing activity real wages and household incomes are increasing the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low household formations are at levels well above the historical average mortgage rates remained extremely favorable at 3 6 homebuilder sentiment is at the highest level since 1999 the inventory of new and existing homes for sale is low and builders continue to shift more product to serve the significant demand for affordable housing however notwithstanding these positive demand fundamentals we do expect the upside on housing will continue to be governed by many of the same supply side challenges that we faced for a number of years these include labor availability lot availability and regulatory burdens that make it more difficult to bring affordable housing to market as we enter 2020 unadjusted housing starts have exceeded 1 3 million on a run rate basis for eight of the last nine months a sign that supply side infrastructure can support this level of increased activity our outlook is for continued modest growth in us housing for 2020 we anticipate just over 1 3 million starts with the improvement driven primarily by additional single family activity turning now to our fourth quarter business results i ll begin the discussion with timberlands charts 5 through 7 timberlands contributed 85 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items and 158 million to adjusted ebitda western timberlands ebitda increased 14 million compared with the third quarter average sales realizations for domestic and japanese export logs increased and road and forestry expenses were seasonally lower in the west fourth quarter weather was milder than normal and log supply remained above average due to favorable logging conditions domestic demand remained steady through the quarter as western lumber pricing improved and mills took limited holiday downtime in our export markets our average log sales realizations to japan increased slightly compared with the third quarter while log sales volumes were slightly lower although japanese housing starts have moderated somewhat following the recent increase in the consumption tax the effect on our key post and beam end market has been minimal post and beam starts were down only 1 5 year to date through november and demand for our logs remained solid in addition a reduction in canadian log exports to japan is driving some japanese saw millers to seek additional us log supply in china the market for us logs weakened in the fourth quarter as abundant competition from salvaged european spruce logs continued to pressure pricing downward to total log inventories at chinese ports increased 6 during the quarter and ended the year at a relatively balanced 3 7 million cubic meters however the share of european spruce has continued to grow through november european logs comprised about 17 of china s year to date softwood log imports compared with only 3 in 2018 our fourth quarter china export realizations decreased compared with the third quarter and sales volumes declined although demand for our china export logs continues to hold up fairly well we are choosing the flex volume to the domestic market to capture higher margin opportunities compared with the year ago quarter our total western log export revenue decreased significantly due to lower sales realizations and volumes in china and japan moving to the south southern timberlands ebitda decreased 6 million compared with the third quarter southern log supply is tightened briefly in october due to wet weather but normalized quickly thereafter with more favorable operating conditions mill inventories remained well supplied through the fourth quarter and our average log realizations decreased 1 fee harvest volumes declined 3 compared with the third quarter although we had hoped to fully catch up on thinning activity postponed during the unusually wet conditions in early 2019 we were unable to complete all of the activity during the fourth quarter on the export side we continue to operate our southern log export business at minimal volumes due to the ongoing 25 chinese tariff on southern yellow pine logs comparing overall southern timberlands fourth quarter results with the year ago quarter ebitda decreased by 4 million due to lower fee harvest volumes and higher road costs this was partially offset by higher average southern sawlog realizations northern timberlands ebitda decreased 1 million compared with the third quarter and 3 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 fee harvest volumes decreased due to the sale of our michigan timberlands which closed in november average realizations decreased slightly real estate energy and natural resources charts 8 and 9 real estate and enr contributed 22 million to fourth quarter earnings and 37 million to adjusted ebitda for the full year the segment generated 274 million of ebitda an increase of 10 million from 2018 fourth quarter ebitda was 23 million lower than the third quarter and 53 million lower than the year ago period due to the timing of real estate sales construction materials and energy royalties also decreased slightly as expected the number of acres sold in the fourth quarter decreased significantly compared with the third quarter and the fourth quarter of 2018 during 2019 our real estate sales activity was heavily weighted toward the first half of the year whereas in 2018 most of our sales occurred in the third and fourth quarters average price per acre was comparable to the third quarter in the year ago quarter an average land basis as a percentage of real estate sales was lower due to transaction mix wood products charts 10 and 11 wood products contributed 60 million to fourth quarter earnings and 110 million to adjusted ebitda i m very pleased with our fourth quarter wood products performance as our teams continue to display an unwavering focus on achieving operational excellence and an industry leading cost structure our results include meaningful operating performance records in each of our four wood products businesses for both the fourth quarter and full year 2019 our lumber and osb businesses delivered the lowest controllable unit manufacturing costs in our history engineered wood products reduce controllable spending by over 11 million on a full year basis and distribution delivered its highest fourth quarter ebitda ever compared with fourth quarter 2018 wood products ebitda increased 44 million or over 65 despite flat lumber realizations and significantly lower pricing for osb compared with the third quarter ebitda decreased 13 million as seasonally lower sales volumes were partially offset by record fourth quarter cost performance in lumber and oriented strand board ebitda for lumber decreased 6 million compared with the third quarter seasonally lower sales volumes and slightly higher cost for western and canadian logs were partially offset by lower controllable manufacturing costs although lumber prices continue to trade in a narrow range during the fourth quarter pricing for many products did recover slightly as stronger housing activity generated incremental demand and channel inventories remained generally low on average the framing lumber composite increased 3 in the fourth quarter compared with the third our average lumber realizations were comparable to the third quarter our production mix is more heavily weighted to wide with southern yellow pine which saw a 9 decrease in published pricing our lumber sales volumes decreased 4 compared with the third quarter and our production volume decreased slightly as we took some additional downtime for maintenance and capital projects fourth quarter ebitda includes 4 million of charges for countervailing and antidumping duties on canadian softwood lumber compared with the year ago quarter lumber ebitda improved by 37 million due to lower unit manufacturing costs lower western log cost and modestly higher sales volumes osb ebitda improved 6 million compared with the third quarter slightly improved realizations and slightly lower unit manufacturing cost and fiber cost more than offset a 2 decrease in sales volumes fourth quarter osb pricing generally mirrored that of lumber the benchmark osb composite price increased 6 compared with the third quarter our average realizations increased 1 as the length of our order files creates a lag between published and realized pricing comparing our fourth quarter results to the year ago quarter osb ebitda decreased by 12 million average sales realizations for osb decreased by 14 but this was significantly offset by lower unit manufacturing costs higher sales volumes and slightly lower fiber costs engineered wood products ebitda decreased 14 million compared with the third quarter sales volumes for both solid section and i joists decreased seasonally and dealers and builders sought to minimize the year end inventories although our overall operating rate decreased unit manufacturing costs improved slightly average sales realizations for i joists increased by 1 average realizations for solid section products decreased by 1 due to seasonal mix compared with the year ago quarter ebitda improved by 15 million due primarily to lower fiber and unit manufacturing costs distribution ebitda totaled 8 million for the fourth quarter this is 2 million lower than the third quarter as seasonally lower sales volumes were partially offset by lower warehouse and delivery costs compared with the year ago quarter ebitda increased by 6 million due to higher sales volumes this improvement is partially attributable to an operational excellence initiative to upgrade the businesses product mix i d like to turn now to operational excellence as a company we achieved over 100 million of operational excellence improvements in 2019 i m very proud of the hard work creativity and cross business collaboration that drove these results timberland s did a remarkable job in capturing 48 million of improvements primarily from initiatives to further optimize silviculture forestry and road activities reduce costs and improve log merchandising and marketing to maximize the revenue from every log we harvest wood products captured 52 million of improvements and has now achieved black at the bottom as we defined it six years ago our 2019 improvements in wood products came from initiatives in three primary areas reducing unit manufacturing cost for lumber and oriented strand board improving product mix in lumber and distribution and increasing log recovery across our mill system beyond each businesses individual efforts we also captured value through initiatives to generate cross business opex historically our opex focus has been on improved performance within the business segment but we have also begun to identify opportunities to drive integrated opex by increasing collaboration between our timberlands and wood products operations the most obvious is further optimizing deliveries of our own logs to our own mills this year through cross business collaboration we delivered 7 million of opex that improve the margin of both segments our operational excellence program has delivered well over 0 5 billion of companywide margin improvement since 2014 this is an incredible achievement but over time this level of success also means the traditional margin improvement opportunities of this magnitude become harder to capture so we are taking a fresh look at opex and what it means for our company as we enter 2020 we are evolving how we define and measure operational excellence at weyerhaeuser operational excellence has been and will continue to be focused on disciplined cost management and margin improvements but we are also expanding opex to include activities to drive future value and improve efficiencies across businesses and functions our opex 2 0 as we are calling it will include four main components to drive continued improvements across our company first is margin improvement these are the familiar opex initiatives focused on improving margin by capturing value at both the top and bottom line second is future value these initiatives recognize activities that drive improved value in the future a good example is working to execute on our targeted thinning reforestation and fertilization programs at the highest levels of quality and completeness we know this improves the value of our timberlands over time third is cost avoidance this category is aimed at avoiding future cost or cost increases examples might include reducing employee turnover and optimize procurement initiatives and fourth is efficiency these initiatives will focus on improvements that enable higher value use of our resources examples would include things such as automating manual work or simplifying business processes together these four categories expand the breadth of opex to include every business and function across our company i m really excited about the opportunities that opex 2 0 creates and the potential it has to further drive our working together culture in 2020 we re targeting 50 million to 70 million of additional opex improvements from these areas and i look forward to sharing more about our key initiatives as the year progresses i will now turn it over to russell to discuss some financial items and our first quarter outlook russell s hagen senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks devin and good morning key outlook items for the first quarter and the full year 2020 are presented on charts 14 and 15 of the earnings slides in our timberlands business we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted ebitda will be slightly higher than the fourth quarter aand our western timberland s operations demand remained stable throughout the fourth quarter mills took advantage of steady product takeaway into january log supply is adequate and log inventories remain at reasonable levels we expect our first quarter domestic log sales volumes will be higher than the fourth quarter the seasonally improved demand we expect average sales realizations will be modestly higher western road costs will be lower compared to the fourth quarter as our road work activity slows as we progressed through the winter months we expect our first quarter japanese export log sales volumes will increase compared to the fourth quarter and average log sales realizations will be comparable demand for our logs remains solid with additional support from continued disruption of the supply competing logs coming out of western canada our chinese export log sales volumes will decline in the first quarter and average log sales realizations are expected to be modestly lower in the fourth quarter on softer demand due to the lunar new year and continued competition from salvage european spruce logs in the south we anticipate our first quarter fee harvest volumes will be seasonally lower and average log sales realizations are expected to be similar to fourth quarter levels in the north first quarter harvest volumes will be lower following the november close of the sale of our michigan timberland s fourth quarter special items include a 48 million pre tax gain related to that transaction in december we announced an agreement to sell our montana timberlands for 145 million and recorded an 80 million pre tax non cash impairment charge in connection with the agreement which is also included as a special item in our fourth quarter results the montana transaction is expected to close in the second quarter and those assets are now listed on our balance sheet as held for sale turning to the full year 2020 we expect total company harvest volume to be slightly over 36 million tons we expect our southern harvest volumes will be comparable to 2019 now harvest volume in the west will be down slightly in the north our harvest volumes will approximately be 40 lower than 2019 due to the divestitures of our michigan and montana timberlands collectively our michigan and montana properties do not generate a meaningful ebitda contribution to our overall timberland segment in our real estate energy and natural resources segment we continue to see strong interest in real estate across our markets and the pacific northwest is particularly active for the full year 2020 we expect adjusted ebitda of approximately 255 million this guidance incorporates the effects of fewer available real estate acres following the divestitures of montana and michigan we expect the cadence of our 2020 real estate activity be similar to 2019 we anticipate land basis as a percentage of real estate sales will be between 55 and 65 for the year for the first quarter we expect adjusted ebitda for the segment will be nearly comparable to the year ago quarter while earnings will be approximately 15 million lower we expect first quarter land basis as a percentage of real estate sales we near the high end of the full year guidance range across our wood products business our customers expects optimism for the year ahead buyers continue to purchase for specific needs and channel inventories are moderate we anticipate sales volumes for lumber and oriented strand board will be slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter for engineered wood products we expect seasonally improved operating rates and lower per unit manufacturing costs in the first quarter we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted ebitda for wood products segment will be slightly higher than the fourth quarter before any benefit from improvement in average sales realizations for lumber first quarter to date average sales realizations are 20 higher than the fourth quarter average and current realizations are 25 above the fourth quarter average oriented strand board first quarter to date and current average sales realizations are comparable with the fourth quarter average as a reminder for lumber every 10 change in realizations is approximately 11 million of ebitda on a quarterly basis for osb every 10 change in realizations is approximately 8 million of ebitda on a quarterly basis chart 12 outlines the major components of our fourth quarter unallocated items unallocated corporate function and variable compensation expense increased compared to the third quarter due to seasonally higher spending and a year to date adjustment for incentive compensation fourth quarter results also include a small non cash expense from elimination of profit in inventory and lifo compared with an income from this item in the third quarter special items in fourth quarter consists of 6 million non cash settlement charge related to transfers of canadian pension assets and liabilities in our pension and post retirement plans in 2019 we made significant progress against the series of actions we announced in 2018 to reduce the liabilities associated with those plans while maintaining benefits security for our plan participants in the last 18 months we ve reduced our future obligations by over 2 billion the year end 2019 funded status for our pension and post retirement plans decreased by approximately 200 million compared to 2018 as a result of a reduction in discount rates discount rates declined by approximately 100 basis points for the us plans and 60 basis points for the canadian plans into 2019 we did not make any cash contributions to the us qualified pension plan and we are not required to make any cash contributions in 2020 cash paid for all other pension and post retirement plans in 2019 was 45 million required cash payments for these plans will be approximately 30 million for 2020 excluding pension settlement charges our non cash non operating pension and post retirement expense was 61 million in 2019 we expect to record approximately 40 million of expense in 2020 the decrease is a reduction is a result of the reduction at discount rates turning to our key financial items which is summarized on chart 13 we entered 2019 with a cash balance of 139 million cash from operations during the fourth quarter was 292 million for the full year 2019 cash from operations was 966 million our capital expenditures for the fourth quarter totaled 143 million and for the full year 2019 were 384 million looking ahead to 2020 we anticipate total capex will be approximately 360 million a 120 million for timberlands inclusive of reforestation costs 235 million for wood products and approximately 5 million for corporate it system upgrades investing cash flows for the fourth quarter also included 297 million of net proceeds from the sale of our michigan timberlands you ll also recall that in the third quarter 2019 we paid 302 million to extinguish the debt of a variable interest entity that was established as part of a timber installment sale in the early 2000 earlier this month we received 362 million of cash from the maturity of the related financial instrument this is the last of these variable interest entities moving on to financing we ended the quarter with approximately 6 4 billion of total debt outstanding this included 230 million balance on our line of credit which was used to bridge the temporary cash outflow associated with the variable interest entity debt maturity we have no debt maturities until 2021 as you may have seen in the 8 k that we filed earlier this week we refinanced our 1 5 billion revolving line of credit to capture more attractive pricing the new credit facility has a five year term that will expire in 2025 in the fourth quarter interest expense was 89 million bringing our full year expense to 366 million excluding special items we expect interest expense will be 345 million for the full year 2020 i ll close my comments with taxes excluding special items in the fourth quarter we recorded 2 million of income tax expense for the full year 2019 our effective tax rate before special items was a benefit of 13 for first quarter and full year 2020 we expect a tax expense of 10 to 15 based on the forecasted mix of earnings for our reit and taxable reit subsidiary turning to cash taxes we received 2 million net tax refund for the full year 2019 inclusive of a 43 million federal tax refund in the fourth quarter as previously discussed we have filed a claim for a 90 million refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution that claim remains in process now i ll turn the call back to devin and look forward to your questions devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer thanks russell one year ago in my first earnings call as ceo i talked about four near term priorities to drive value for shareholders i m pleased with our execution to date and our focus on generating superior and sustainable value will continue in 2020 and beyond the first priority i highlighted was driving opex with a focus on cost and reliability i m incredibly proud of our work in opex in 2019 and i m excited about what lies ahead in opex 2 0 second was continuing to drive lasting culture change we remain focused on the key behaviors to drive success including accountability and urgency and increasing our focus on innovation across the company third was people development in 2019 we continued our intense focus on people development and worked to increasingly build our bench of future leaders and key personnel across the organization and fourth was disciplined capital allocation we re committed to our balanced capital allocation philosophy of returning cash to shareholders investing in our businesses and maintaining an appropriate capital structure in 2019 we continued to deliver on each of these capital allocation priorities we returned over 1 billion of cash to shareholders we invested over 380 million in disciplined capital expenditures to sustain and further improve our businesses and we took steps to maintain an appropriate capital structure and support our investment grade credit ratings by reducing our future pension liabilities entering 2020 i m encouraged that the us housing market continues to show signs of stronger activity although pricing for many of our commodity products remains soft we re optimistic that we will see continued improvement as we head into the 2020 building season going forward i m excited about the opportunities in front of us and we remain focused on driving superior long term value for shareholders by improving performance through operational excellence fostering a winning an innovative culture that positions us to capitalize on a range of market conditions and demonstrating disciplined capital allocation and with that i d like to open the floor for questions questions and answers operator our first question will come from the line of brian maguire with goldman sachs derrick laton goldman sachs analyst hey good morning this is derrick laton sitting in for brian russell s hagen senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning derrick laton goldman sachs analyst thanks for taking my questions yeah if we could just go back for a second devin to the comments that you had mentioned around lumber and osb i think you ve mentioned a little bit of a lag coming through on some of the osb pricing can we expect that even holding everything equal to accelerate a little bit as we go through the first quarter just based on some of the gains that we saw exiting 4q devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer yeah we saw pricing come up a little bit in 4q there was a little bit of a dip now it started to come back up so as russell mentioned quarter to date our osb realizations are flat relative to the fourth quarter that being said certainly i think the market sentiment is that the housing activity is going to continue to improve we re seeing a lot of optimism out there and so we would anticipate that as we get closer to the 2020 building season and that gets in full swing we re going to see some uplift on osb pricing as we get into the quarter derrick laton goldman sachs analyst okay that s helpful thank you and then just on the lumber side russell like you called out is going to be about 20 higher on average i think current price is about 25 above the fourth quarter average it s actually a little bit better than i would have expected just looking at the composite is that a function of a little bit of a lag as well coming through the income statement or is that more just a function of some of the mix shift within the product rates that you guys produce russell s hagen senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah that would be more attributable to the mix shift of what we produce in our lumber operations derrick laton goldman sachs analyst okay i think that s it from me thanks guys devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mark wilde with bank of montreal mark wilde bank of montreal analyst good morning devin good morning russell devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer good morning mark russell s hagen senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning mark mark wilde bank of montreal analyst devin i wondered is it possible to get some sense for where you see land sales per year over the next three to five years that we exclude kind of northern timberlands russell s hagen senior vice president and chief financial officer sure mark this is russell so as we noted we re going to bring down the real estate ebitda a little bit from this year from 2019 there s really two things that are happening in there the first is on the energy natural resources side we had a couple of one time type transactions we had a small asset sale and then we had some recoveries on a royalty audit and then we re also factoring in less hbu sales coming out of that montana and michigan properties the michigan properties are sold montana we re expecting to close in the second quarter of this year and so that gives us that 255 million number for 2020 kind of on a run rate basis i think that 250 million to 255 million is a reasonable number for the run rate for that business as we stated in the past our goal is to structure that total avo program and the pipeline so that we have a sustainable business over time so mark wilde bank of montreal analyst okay and then just as a follow on i d like to just kind of step back and think about sort of leveraging your franchise with the global focus on sustainability and carbon capture only going up any thoughts on ways to kind of both leverage your expertise but also the strong kind of social and environmental reputation that weyerhaeuser has devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer yeah absolutely mark i would tell you that s top of mind for us as you know there has been a lot of momentum around wood based building for one but also as we see more and more companies talking about becoming carbon neutral or carbon negative our view is practically speaking that s going to be very hard to do without looking to the forest and our ability to sequester carbon and so i think that is getting a lot of discussion a lot of talk in the industry it s something that we re very focused on candidly it s in the early stages of figuring out what the mechanics for that market are going to look like there is a private market piece to that there is a regulatory piece to that but we re staying very focused on it clearly i feel pretty comfortable in saying no organization in the history of america has planted more trees than weyerhaeuser company so that is an area where we have deep expertise and i think there may be a role for us to play so we re keeping a very close watch on that and we ll look for an opportunity to participate in a profitable ways that as that develops mark wilde bank of montreal analyst would that include kind of structures beyond just outright ownership of timberland devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer i think we re at a stage right now mark where we re really looking at all different kinds of opportunities so i think at this juncture i wouldn t foreclose any of those options mark wilde bank of montreal analyst okay very good i ll turn it over devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer thanks mark operator your next question comes from the line of collin mings with raymond james collin mings raymond james analyst thanks good morning everyone devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer good morning collin collin mings raymond james analyst first for me just can you elaborate on your full year outlook for the export markets and harvest plans in the west how much of the downtick in harvest this year represents just a continued normalization of volume versus a response to some of the headwinds that you alluded to in the prepared remarks about the european sourced wood and other things impacting the asian markets devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer yeah let me start with the western harvest levels now really to understand what s going on in the west you have to go back to our longview timber acquisition and you recall that when we did that deal one of the benefits of that transaction was that they had a significant amount over matured timber in their portfolio and so for several years after that acquisition we were intentionally bringing that harvest level harvest age down which increased our harvest levels in the west over the last couple of years we ve really been on the tail end of that and so as we roll into 2020 that volume that we re anticipating in the west which is down around 3 versus 2019 that s what i would expect all else being equal to be the harvest levels for the next several years before it starts coming up again and so that s really the answer on the harvest now frankly you can flex up or flex down a little bit depending on market conditions and we do that from time to time but the 2020 harvest schedule really is kind of that normalized harvest level in the west for the next several years speaking to the export markets i ll start with china really last year for most of the year even though there was more european salvage wood coming into the market i would say for the first three quarters it wasn t having a material impact on our export volumes to that china market out of the northwest we really did see in the fourth quarter that european salvage wood started to have an impact in the china market and we really started to see that impact our pricing certainly as we got deeper into the fourth quarter as we think about the magnitude of that european salvage wood going into the market and you combine that with what is traditionally a pretty slow time of the year with the lunar new year holiday in that market and you also have the dynamic of the corona virus and so i would expect the china market for us out of the pacific northwest is going to be choppy for a little while the japan market frankly remained solid for us you ve seen housing starts dip down just a little bit but the key market for us as i mentioned earlier is that post and beam market and that s held up pretty well and you combine that with some of the challenges from the canadian log exports we re still seeing good volume and sales activity into the japan market this year collin mings raymond james analyst thank you for all the detail there devin just switching gears to kind of opex 2 0 can you maybe just elaborate a little bit on where you re targeting the 50 million to 70 million just across the four different buckets you outlined specifically how much would maybe fall into that margin bucket and that efficiency bucket devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer yeah i think we re still in the early stages of rolling this out to the organization but what i would say is going into the year i would still anticipate the majority of that is going to come from that margin bucket the future value efficiency and cost avoidance are new pieces of that program and so we do think that that will pick up steam as we roll it out to the organization but i would say sitting here right now most of that 50 million to 70 million for year one is going to come out of the margin bucket collin mings raymond james analyst okay and then switching to russell can you just maybe touch a little bit more on the avo process and where that stands again recognizing that is fluid but there was obviously a number of large sales in 2019 are there any other large transactions that you re going to be pursuing and kind of the foreseeable future or you feel like a lot of the heavy lifting as far as the non core asset sales is complete for at least for now russell s hagen senior vice president and chief financial officer so i ll talk to the avo and i ll talk to kind of your second question on large transactions the avo process as you re aware that s really an evergreen process so we re constantly evaluating our timberlands to determine if we are the best owner of that particular tract or if we can capture a higher value by selling it through our avo process so as we ve noted we have about at the beginning of the year we had 1 6 million acres identified in the avo process that we would take to market over the next 10 to 15 years as i stated earlier our goal is to have a sustainable business over time so as far as large transactions i m not going to comment on our on kind of our future expectations related to large transactions but i ll reiterate even on the avo process we still look even on a broader basis across the portfolio and make sure that the timberlands that we own are returning the highest value and we get a good return on assets and so as we demonstrated in the past we have sold out of markets that are not strategic to us for the long term but i think as we look at our portfolio today we have no immediate plans collin mings raymond james analyst thank you both i ll turn it over russell s hagen senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator your next question comes from the line of mark weintraub with seaport mark weintraub seaport analyst thank you two follow ups really the first thank you for the information on the western harvest by the way that s completely consistent with presentation you did it back in december 2016 where you show exactly as you laid out that same presentation it shows that the southern harvest would likely be increasing during that 17 through 26 time horizon and then i realize maybe there are some sales of acreage etc perhaps but what s the outlook for the southern harvest relative to the levels we saw in 19 and what you seem to be suggesting for 2020 devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer yeah mark and those are always fluid through the real estate programs you get puts and takes here and there we are not in a position right now i think to give public guidance on the long term other than to say in 2020 for the south we re looking at comparable we do have a little bit heavier mix to fiber for 2020 but it s going to be pretty consistent within the range that we have in 2020 mark weintraub seaport analyst and maybe it s not a fair question on this on a spot moment but is the type is there any reason why the general direction you would have been expecting a couple of years ago wouldn t still be applicable today devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer yeah i think over time certainly as we have new generations of seedlings come ready for harvest you d expect the volumes to go up over time so directionally i don t think anything has changed the timing of it you have a little bit of up and down on any particular a year or two basis but directionally over time i don t think anything s changed mark weintraub seaport analyst okay and on the european spruce salvage wood any intelligence at this point as to how long this issue is likely to be with us devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer yes so i ll tell you what i do know and then what i don t know and i ll start with what we think we know which is unlike what we saw with the mountain pine beetle in british columbia the spruce beetle in europe seems to leave that wood salvageable for a much lower period and i think the general consensus that s building is one to three years on the stump is really as long as it s viable after you see that damage the question that s harder to answer frankly is when is the infestation going to abate and so i don t know that we have a definitive view or if anyone has a definitive view on when that damage spruce beetle wood is going to stop growing across europe and so i do think our view is we ve seen the geographies where you have that impacted wood acting speedily to try to get out in front of it and salvage as much of that timber as they can but as a practical matter there are limits on how much you can do that so it s hard to say how long it s going to last when you really start seeing the spruce beetle die off i think it will be a limited time period after that when you should see the volume start to slow down mark weintraub seaport analyst and so is it fair to surmise recognizing lots of uncertainty here that it s probably going to be with us for a couple of years but then at some point in time you end up having less wood coming from europe than even prior to the infestation beginning is that how to think about it devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer that s correct and that s how we re viewing it we re going to i think this is going to be with us for a year or two but as you say it s important to remember when that volume goes away it s going to have to be filled in from somewhere else and so when you have that significant amount of wood that goes out of the system it is going to change kind of the global supply chains for log supply mark weintraub seaport analyst thank you devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer yep thanks operator your next question comes from the line of steve chercover with d a davidson steve chercover d a davidson analyst thanks good morning everyone devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer good morning russell s hagen senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning steve chercover d a davidson analyst so first question on your website montana is included in the western us acreage but the volume is evidently coming out of the northern fee harvest so is that because the log prices in montana are closer to northeast values russell s hagen senior vice president and chief financial officer steve when we actually put together the regions at the time of the merger we had put we had put that montana property in that northern region and so we ve always reported that montana property in the northern region and then washington and oregon in the western region it is a different product a little different pricing so that s just how we set it up at the time of the merger steve chercover d a davidson analyst okay so from a financial standpoint both of the all that land is northern so i wanted to get a sense on the impact then of the financial impact on the sales would it be fair to say that given the aggregate sales price of 445 million the ebitda was around 20 million is that russell s hagen senior vice president and chief financial officer no i think in the last call what we had mentioned is full year 2018 was about 19 million and you ll see full year 2019 at about 15 million so we would expect that montana and michigan to be about half of that number steve chercover d a davidson analyst okay thanks for that and just one other quick one can you elaborate what you mean by innovation is it new product development in wood products or is it along the lines of log optimizations by end market devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer yeah i d say the majority of that is operational innovation so that s things like leveraging technology within the mills or out in the woods to drive down log and haul cost to optimize how we build roads to mechanized things in the mills that s the majority of it at this point we do in our wood products business we do product innovation as well but when we talk about the majority of the innovation work that we ve done here over the last year or two has really been more around operational innovation steve chercover d a davidson analyst got it okay thank you both devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of paul quinn with rbc capital markets paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst yeah thanks very much good morning guys devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer good morning russell s hagen senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst hey just had a question around capex and thanks for the detailed break down into the buckets but that 235 million you re spending on wood products maybe you could highlight some of the bigger project and is there any volume gains that you expect to get over time on some of these projects going forward devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer yeah with the 235 million which is down about 15 million from 2019 and partially that s just a reflection of the fact that as we finish up on the dierks and millport capital projects were which were much larger in scale we just have a larger number of smaller activity in the capex bucket across wood products and so i don t have anything significant to highlight of the millport or dierks magnitude it s really just a lot of smaller capex projects that are really focused on driving down cost improving reliability and really driving efficiencies in the mill set you ll get some incremental around the margins volume pick up with some of those but the volume increase really is the primary focus of our capital programs at present paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks for that and then just maybe i just trying to understand what s going on in timberland transactions i haven t seen that many transactions we ve had interest rates go up in 18 and then come down 19 and 20 i suspect that had some kind of effect on valuations maybe you could just help me understand what s going on in the market russell s hagen senior vice president and chief financial officer sure this is russell on 2019 based on kind of our listing of all the transactions we re expecting to hit about 1 8 billion and we really didn t see any big deals like we saw in 2018 we saw probably four deals in 2019 over 100 million and then remainder were small and medium deals so about 3 million acres looks like it s going to trade in 2019 so that s about 2 2 5 of the investable market that seems kind of on par with what we ve seen over the last few years i think as we look into 2020 i would expect we would break that 2 billion transaction value number and when you take the poke deal and then the recent announcement we made on the montana deal you are at about 800 million and so it s pretty strong start of the year given we re in january as far as timber values i would say they remained strong even with the soft product pricing in 2019 we really didn t see big value swings in the timberland values and i think that reflects more of the longer term nature that the investors have in this space and companies have in this space so we re still seeing a strong flow of capital to good deals and the right deals and quality timberlands remain in high demand and as we ve said in the past we re in a pretty advantage position we have timberlands in every major wood basket in the united states and we have the opportunity to see every transaction and so we re active but we re also very disciplined in our acquisition strategy paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst thanks for the help good luck devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer thanks russell s hagen senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes in the line of chip dillon with vertical research chip dillon vertical research partners analyst hi good morning thanks for all the details as you look at the long term future japan s population obviously is shrinking and obviously there are other parts of asia where demand could certainly get better for your timber how do you think about those long term trends i mean have you done some work on where you think five 10 years from now you ll see both japan and other asian markets especially as it really has a big impact on your western timberland profitability devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer yeah absolutely we do spend a lot of time doing analytics around that with respect to japan you re absolutely right the demographics are such that the population is declining and that is clearly going to have an impact on housing over time i think couple things that may mitigate the impact on us however or again our focus is primarily that post and beam market and i think that is going to hold share and pick up share of overall housing starts in japan over time and so i think the impact on us will be less than on kind of the stick frame the second thing i would say is just like in the united states and europe japan is looking for opportunities to do more commercial and multi story buildings out of wood and so i think there s an opportunity to pick up share on that front as well to mitigate some of the impacts from population decline on housing but you re right in a broader sense japan s population is not growing there are other economies across asia where we do see growing populations and so whether you re thinking china or india or some of the other southeast asian markets that are experiencing growth we ve spent a lifetime on the ground in all of those markets we have in china in particular a pretty strong customer base and so one of our focus areas is to continue to grow market in china and ultimately other markets for some of those higher end douglas fir products and we think over time we ll make good progress on that operator your next question will come from the line of mark connelly with stephens inc mark connelly stephens inc analyst thank you if we assume that the labor issues in construction persists do you think we re going to start seeing builders more aggressively embrace either prefab components or some other labor reduction or is there enough other issues like lot availability that they just don t have enough incentive to change the way they operate yet devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer well i do you think that you re starting to see some of the builders particularly the larger builders embrace panelization off site construction activities and i do think that trend will continue there are limits on how high that can go but i do think we ve reached a point where the labor constraints have caused many of the builders to really start to look for other options to mitigate that challenge so i do you think you re going to see that grow the labor availability i think still remains one of the biggest challenges for the builders in both just meeting the construction needs but also with the affordability pace and so i do think they re going to continue to look for ways to mitigate those labor challenges mark connelly stephens inc analyst so is there an opportunity for weyerhaeuser in that to get involved in more of that process devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer i think in the near term the biggest opportunity for us is to stay close to those in customers and the builders and various folks throughout the channel that are doing that work i think our biggest opportunity short term is just to be a key supplier making sure we understand what the needs are in those panelized construction activities and be a good solid partner for them i don t anticipate us getting into panelized manufacturing here in the near term longer term obviously we ll continue to watch the market and if our view changes on the ability to create value in that space we wouldn t necessarily rule that out but i don t think that s a short term priority for us mark connelly stephens inc analyst okay that makes a lot of sense just one other question with all the supply distortions and issues we had in the south last year do you think private landowners are caught up on the land they wanted to sell or is there still a backlog there russell s hagen senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah this is russell pardon me mark connelly stephens inc analyst sorry i said land i meant stumpage russell s hagen senior vice president and chief financial officer on the stumpage side i would say that probably the markets were a little slower last year as far as getting contractors and broker dealers out onto those non industrial private lands i think that s what you re referring to mark connelly stephens inc analyst yes devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer so we don t have a real clean gauge on what those volumes are but i would expect that that will still be an area of focus for the non industrial privates probably coming into this year and maybe the following years mark connelly stephens inc analyst okay very helpful thank you operator our last question will come from the line of george staphos with bank of america john babcock bank of america analyst hi good morning this is actually john babcock on for george just wanted to thank you for taking my questions just starting out i was wondering if you could talk about which products are likely to see the incremental benefit from kind of this new opex set up and also if you could kind of give some weighting as to which product lines that might be helpful too devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer yeah i think just at a high level we would anticipate it s kind of going to be evenly split between wood products and timberlands i think one of the differences that we re looking at from opex 2 0 is we re really looking to expand it and how we measure it beyond just the businesses defined opportunities even at a functional level increase the level of cross business opex that we re trying to drive so that may change how the buckets are allocated a little bit around the margins but going in we would anticipate that would be kind of half and half wood products and timberlands john babcock bank of america analyst thank you and then can you review the key point as to why the montana timberland sales made sense from both the strategic and valuation standpoint russell s hagen senior vice president and chief financial officer sure this is russell there s two things i guess i would point out on that transaction the first is over the last number years we ve been very active in capturing value on those lands we ve done conservation sales higher and better use sales we ve also done some timber transactions so we really have a lot of opportunities to understand the market and kind of with the future value that land would be to us so the second is when we go through our evaluation process it s very detailed and robust so we look at a number of things when coming to evaluation on a particular property and we look at the markets we look at stocking levels age class growing cycles pc mix cost inputs those are all taken into consideration when we assess the value but also when we assessed fit for our broader portfolio strategy so based on our experience in these markets and in our expectations and what we ve achieved as far as capturing value on the portfolio today we are very comfortable with how that sale fits into our broader strategy and we re very pleased with the price we re receiving for the timberlands john babcock bank of america analyst yeah thank you that s all i have devin w stockfish president and chief executive officer all right well i believe that was the final question so thank you to everyone for joining us this morning and thank you for your continued interest in weyerhaeuser company operator

they would be known to each other only by their noms de guerre mecky mr xu julie mr li richard jenny and big sis when the seven eb 5 investors gathered at the eddington house cafe in shanghai known as a favorite haunt of the essayist eileen chang during the pre revolutionary era it was the first time any of them had met in person although they had been in contact on wechat for months for privacy they swore one another to secrecy some were concerned about the political atmosphere in china expressing a desire to emigrate could be problematic especially for those with high level government connections the urbane chinese citizens were all members of a group that called itself eb5 association of investors or eb5ai which formed last spring to represent the interests of investors lobbying for eb 5 reform on a saturday afternoon in late october the real deal met with seven of them in shanghai to learn about their experiences with the federal program and their thoughts on what was to come each had invested 500 000 with that money going into a wide variety of projects across the united states and they all faced a common dilemma a decade long backlog following a few boom years in the mid 2010s the expected wait time for a chinese investor who applies for an immigration visa through the eb 5 program today has ballooned to 16 years according to the latest statistics from the u s state department this situation has been damaging for all segments of the eb 5 food chain including real estate developers and intermediaries in the states who are now facing additional pressure from federal rule changes introduced late last year upping the minimum investment required and restricting areas where that minimum applies the business has really declined substantially as a result of the situation with the backlog because chinese investors are not coming forward and they always provided the bulk of the people said ira kurzban of miami based immigration law firm kurzban kurzban tetzeli and pratt who filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of eb 5 investors against the department of state in 2018 challenging federal policies that have contributed to the backlog eb 5 industry insiders in the u s have been able to find powerful allies such as sen lindsey graham who is co sponsoring a bill to ease some of the new restrictions but the tens of thousands of backlogged investors in china the ultimate source of billions of dollars for the u s real estate industry each year have found themselves in a dreadful position half a world away and with few options at their disposal so when trd proposed meeting with some of them in person many were eager to take the opportunity but with some reservations for this reason the investors are referred to here by either their surnames or western first names they ve adopted and some information that might lead to the identification of individual investors has been omitted this is their story we re the elite while other eb 5 focused interest groups have been formed by regional centers in the u s the members of eb5ai saw their group s role as representing investor interests in particular which might not always be in line with the intermediaries who invested their money on their behalf for the investors the first order of business was to dispel what they saw as likely misconceptions about chinese participants in the eb 5 program we re not tuhao the investor who called herself jenny said on behalf of the group using the chinese term for a type of extravagant nouveau riche that had emerged during the country s economic reform often through unscrupulous business practices or government ties we re the elite jenny added pointing to the fact that all investors present had received a university education she herself was a retired engineer more importantly the majority of us identify with american values and would like to establish roots there said xu who works as an executive at a multinational corporation in shanghai why else would we choose to leave our homes for such a distant foreign land a win win chinese interest in the eb 5 program began to skyrocket in 2014 the same year the canadian government put an end to its own decades old immigrant investor program canada s ministry of finance had found that the program significantly undervalued permanent residence in the country without generating economic returns emigration agencies in china for whom the canadian program had long been a cash cow it had its own six year backlog of 65 000 pending applications at the time of its cancellation quickly pivoted south to the united states just as american real estate developers were facing a financing crunch in the wake of the great recession the program became a way to help builders get money which became very tight after 2008 said kurzban the immigration lawyer it was kind of a perfect situation in which all three sides benefited the investors who spoke with trd in shanghai were all part of this wave which lasted from 2014 through 2017 xu recalled first hearing about the eb 5 program around 2008 but had no interest in pursuing it at the time only in 2015 amid fluctuations in his work situation did he consider a move to the u s where he had studied in the late 1990s jenny who decided to invest in eb 5 in 2014 and spent a year choosing the right project had heard stories about really rich chinese investors who had gone the eb 5 route before it was cool but she said most have since given up u s residency to avoid being taxed on their worldwide income for several of these investors obtaining u s residency for their children was a key consideration jenny s son had stayed with a host family in virginia during high school and had become very attached to the american lifestyle they were a korean american family jenny recalled very nice people they fed him so well julie an architect and mother of two who traveled from hangzhou for the meeting had a similar motive her elder son stayed first with a family in chicago for a year and then with a family in oregon and li a small business owner has a daughter who is studying film in los angeles not far from the project that he invested in compared to other means of obtaining residency in the u s the eb 5 route appeared to present a number of advantages first of all investors could apply for residency without already being in the u s not a bad arrangement for someone with a well paying urban white collar job or private business in china secondly in contrast to the lottery system that is used to select h 1b visa applicants the eb 5 program appeared to offer greater certainty for a price chinese investors in particular were drawn to the eb 5 program because it enabled them to obtain green cards in an expedited manner for their families said pierre debbas a partner and founding member of real estate law firm romer debbas llp many of these investors wanted their children to attend college in the u s thus making the program more appealing compared to perhaps similar programs in other countries he added for comparison the u k s investor visa program requires a minimum investment of 2 million pounds while its australian counterpart costs 5 million australian dollars about 3 4 million and while canada s national investor visa program has been abolished the province of quebec offers a similar deal for an investment of 1 2 million canadian dollars compared with these options the eb 5 program s 500 000 threshold seemed like a real bargain and a much more attainable goal for upper middle class chinese investors from boom to boom in retrospect a large chunk of the eb 5 driven real estate development boom in the u s was driven by an even more dramatic real estate boom or bubble some might say in china specifically the market for residential real estate in china s major cities apartment prices in cities like shanghai and beijing have more than doubled over the past decade and urban homeownership rates in china are among the highest in the world at around 90 percent faced with limited investment alternatives ownership of second or even third homes often left empty has also become increasingly common emigration minded urban middle class chinese were in the perfect position to benefit from this boom and the relatively low investment threshold of half a million dollars unchanged since 1990 meant that many investors were able to secure the necessary eb 5 funds just by cashing out of their apartments with the exception of one investor who sourced funds from his family business the group that met with trd all funded the bulk of their investments by either selling or taking out mortgages on their homes while sourcing funds the investors also set out to find a migration agent and select a project to invest in most went with one of the big franchises in the business huijia wailian and shimaotong to name a few but mecky an engineer turned housewife relied on the services of an acquaintance a former journalist who changed careers to become one of the hundreds of mom and pop eb 5 migration agents operating in china at the time migration consulting had become a very lucrative business with agencies pulling in as much as 40 percent of each investment s value in fees the investors took varied approaches to selecting their projects richard a small business owner with many relatives in the u s and xu both became investors in the poster child of the eb 5 boom the related companies hudson yards megadevelopment richard was able to secure a 4 percent interest rate for his investment and he made a point of inspecting the site in person on a visit to new york city xu meanwhile agreed to make a no interest investment jenny who spent a full year searching for a project to invest in even sent her son to examine a site in new jersey she eventually settled on a hotel development in a different part of the country altogether sign up for the undefined newsletter sign up big sis chose an infrastructure project the construction of a connection between the pennsylvania turnpike and i 95 and said the fact that it was a government project with what was at times portrayed as a government guarantee contributed to the decision it seemed a bit too good to be true she noted with their investment funds secured and deployed all the investors had to do was wait but none expected to wait so long a spokesperson for the regional center behind the pennsylvania turnpike project said every investor received a private memorandum and limited partnership agreement that clearly explained the nature of the investment the delaware valley regional center spokesperson also noted that the pennsylvania turnpike commission borrowed a total of 383 million and that the project s senior debt is rated a by s p moment of truth jenny the retired engineer first heard about the eb 5 visa backlog in fall 2017 at a mid autumn festival gala hosted by her migration agency shimaotong the young lady at the agency office called me several times to remind me to attend she recalled looking back i feel like there was something she really wanted me to know something that she couldn t tell me directly after meeting with fellow eb 5 investors at the event she realized the severity of the situation i had looked at how long people who invested before me had had to wait and just assumed that that would be my wait time as well she said other investors said that they had a similar mindset in fact the pipeline of chinese investors waiting to apply for immigration visas had already been clogged up for years by that point the final action date for mainland chinese eb 5 investors was nov 22 2014 as of this january according to the u s state department s latest monthly visa bulletin that means someone who invested on that date just a few months into the boom might have become eligible to apply for an immigration visa only recently more than five years down the line data disclosed by u s citizenship and immigration services in 2018 in response to a freedom of information request shows that 109 visa applications submitted by mainland chinese citizens in 2014 were still pending four years later that number ballooned to 710 in 2015 2 444 in 2016 and 3 621 in 2017 but in 2017 people still held out hope a lot of investors were looking for signs of reform richard said noting many people were confident that new legislation would resolve the backlog before it got out of hand american promoters of eb 5 projects warned hesitant investors that the cost of investment would go up soon as did eventually happen in late 2019 and argued that it was better to secure a spot in the line now than to wait for the backlog to be cleared later at this point chinese investors had already sunk an estimated 16 billion into the eb 5 program much of which will eventually need to be redeployed into other ventures in order to keep the investments at risk there were a lot of silly people with money to spare who fell victim to a fallacious way of thinking xu said including himself in this criticism and some people got lazy and decided they d just wait in line and see what happened by 2018 i realized the backlog was a serious issue and by 2019 i started to think it might be an unsolvable problem he added the way migration agencies handled the slow brewing crisis exacerbated matters xu observed that the agencies were clearly trying to split investors up and prevent them from organizing while things were going well many agencies had set up groups on wechat to share project updates with investors some u s developers also set up chinese language wechat accounts and arranged face to face meetings with investors but the transparency started to slip as more and more investors began asking questions about the backlog big sis the investor in the pennsylvania turnpike project was added to a wechat group with more than 500 people which had been set up by the agency handling her investment people kept asking for more information about what was going on and the agency kept saying it s too soon to tell for sure she recalled then one day they finally admitted that there was a serious problem and they deleted the group the next day the eb 5 endgame making significant changes to 30 year old immigration legislation from the other side of the world is a tall task but the members of eb5ai have identified a few courses of action the first is lobbying for legislative changes a cause that individual investors can contribute to either by donating funds or by taking the fight to social media as trd has previously documented large numbers of investors have taken to tweeting memes at u s politicians in an effort to draw attention to their plight the chinese government s censorship of the internet makes this slightly trickier but motivated investors can easily learn to circumvent it with a vpn and if they happen to work for a foreign company that has unfettered access to the world wide web they can simply tweet on the job the second approach is as american as apple pie suing xu for example has thrown his support behind kurzban s class action lawsuit against the u s state department which if successful would achieve some of the main goals of legislative reform we re hoping that one way or the other we ll get rid of counting derivatives which is kind of a ridiculous practice that s made up by the state department kurzban said referring to the department s practice of counting family members toward the annual visa quota instead of just the primary applicant investors themselves i don t think the statute says what the government is saying it says the class action has already faced one setback as a judge denied the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order against the state department in december 2018 the court has yet to make a decision on the department s motion to dismiss the case outright it s difficult to predict but it doesn t look completely positive kurzban said but if we don t prevail we ll appeal it meanwhile the investors said they expect many more eb 5 lawsuits to surface in the coming year given the five year term typical of eb 5 investments 2020 is a year in which large numbers of investors will likely begin demanding their money back if it s no longer possible for us to get residency then my bottom line is that i absolutely want my investment back said li emigrating to america was a dream of mine but if that can t happen i might just go back to my home village in southern zhejiang province he added investors noted that the uncertainty around the backlog had made career and family planning impossible as parents faced the possibility of receiving u s residency while their children had already aged out there s no clear way forward and no way back either li said at the same time eb 5 intermediaries and chinese migration agencies have both moved on to newer easier targets while regional centers are increasingly sourcing funds from vietnam india and latin america chinese migration agencies are now trying to sell prospective emigrants on other golden visa programs around the world everywhere from st kitts and nevis to vanuatu greece which established an investor visa program in 2013 was recently one of the top destinations for chinese investors looking for european residency and following the recent economic crash in neighboring turkey agencies have begun touting that country as a cheaper alternative as far as i can remember this is the first time chinese migration agencies have tried convincing people to move to a country with an active war raging on its borders said eb 5 industry observer connor chen who runs the widely read eb5sir blog for their part however the eb5ai investors who met with trd said they had never considered emigrating anywhere besides the u s canada new zealand and australia all just seem too small richard quipped others in the group echoed that sentiment when we chose to invest in the eb 5 program we were assured by the fact that this was a federal program operated by a well run government whose values we admired julie said for many of us the mismanagement of eb 5 has led to a lot of disappointment and disillusionment with the united states
with great fanfare and without the presence of the democratic congressional contingent that pushed for ratification president donald trump signed the u s mexico canada agreement on the south lawn of the white house on wednesday morning with some 400 guests including farmers ceos and workers in attendance the deal is a reboot of the north american free trade agreement that has governed trade between the united states and its neighbors since 1994 although trump has promoted usmca as a wholesale overhaul that replaced the nafta nightmare as he called it in his remarks wednesday trade experts said this characterization was inaccurate usmca is 95 percent the existing nafta agreement said jacob kirkegaard a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics there are provisions in there that cover things like e commerce and digital services but with regard to the manufacturing sector for instance there s very little change trump claimed the deal will cost u s economic growth by 1 2 percent but economists voiced skepticism white house officials had previously estimated the economic boost at nearly 0 5 percent which some also viewed as overblown mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics described the new north american deal as a tweak to the original it s more marketing there he said trade economists say a few economic sectors will see an incremental boost higher automotive rules of origin requirements will increase the percentage of car parts that need to come from north america and enhanced labor and environmental standards cut down on the financial incentives automakers have to make cars and car parts in mexico where labor costs are lower and environmental regulation more lax the deal expanded intellectual property protections and provisions for digital trade a sector that has burgeoned since nafta was originally negotiated usmca also opens up the canadian market to american dairy products an element on which trump focused when touting how the deal will benefit farm states he didn t get much he got to rename it zandi said the deal could provide a lift at the margins to the automotive and dairy industries but would not generate the kinds of figures the white house has pushed like 68 billion in new economic activity and 176 000 jobs he didn t get much he got to rename it kirkegaard said to the extent that trump can claim credit for an economic lift provided by the usmca economists said that was more a function of the white house keeping most of the existing agreement in place after initially threatening to pull out of nafta entirely without a replacement in place i would think of this more in terms of what would ve happened if this agreement didn t go back into place that would ve been disastrous for the economy said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america exiting nafta without replacing it would have forced the three nations to revert to wto rules around trade which would have upended supply chains and disrupted production throughout the continent we have to view it as a bullet dodged because the alternative would have been trump pulling out of the whole thing which would have been far worse kirkegaard said he was threatening to overturn over the table in this regard trade experts drew parallels between wednesday s signing ceremony and the white house s phase one china deal signed in washington this month the phase one trade deal with china will also have no macroeconomic impact except forestall an escalation in the u s trade war with china which would have likely pushed the global economy into recession zandi said according to the nonpartisan tax foundation the china tariffs already imposed shaved roughly a quarter of a percentage point off gdp growth reduced wages and cost nearly 200 000 jobs the threatened tariffs that were avoided when the china trade deal was struck would have doubled the hit to gdp the key achievement of the usmca was to keep the north american trade system intact much as it was under nafta and ending a very destructive period of uncertainty said peter petri a professor of international finance at the brandeis international business school we are better off with these trade agreements than without them because we ended costly uncertainties but we are worse off in trade policy than three years ago he said

share we generated 1 7 billion of operating cash flow for the year adjusted earnings were 3 7 billion or 8 05 per share during the fourth quarter we continue to progress our major growth projects we achieved a major milestone with the initial start up the gray oak pipeline midstream performed well delivering another record quarter in the transportation business refining and chemicals ran at 97 utilization our turnaround activity and weak product and petrochemical margins impacted our financial results during 2019 we made significant progress on executing our growth strategy in midstream and chemicals operating excellence remains a top priority for us and we maintain our industry leading performance we can always do better we believe that zero incidents zero accident workplace is achievable and it s a goal we work hard for daily midstream completed a number of growth projects and delivered strong operating performance contributing to another year of record adjusted earnings for that segment for the year refining ran at 94 utilization while cpchem operated at 97 o p utilization in 2019 we delivered a 34 total shareholder return for phillips 66 shareholders phillips 66 partners is integral to our midstream strategy psxp delivered strong operating performance eliminated incentive distribution rights achieved a 56 total unitholder return in 2019 phillips 66 partners continues to be a leading master limited partnership with a strong financial position attractive growth opportunities and disciplined capital allocation we announced our advantedge66 business transformation program in late 2019 advantedge66 is leveraging technology to transform the way we run our operations execute projects and make decisions due to this program we expect to deliver 1 2 billion of enhancements by the end of 2021 we re committed to strong shareholder distributions during the year we returned 3 2 billion through dividends and share repurchases in 2019 we increased the quarterly dividend 12 5 and announced a 3 billion increase to our share repurchase program since 2012 we ve returned 26 billion to shareholders and reduced our initial shares outstanding by 33 we made significant progress on our key projects these projects will contribute to future cash generation and create shareholder value phillips 66 partners commenced initial operations on the gray oak pipeline in november and we anticipate full service in the second quarter of 2020 the 900 000 barrel per day pipeline will transport crude oil from the permian and the eagle ford to the texas gulf coast including our sweeny refinery phillips 66 partners owns a 42 25 interest in the pipeline gray oak will connect to multiple refineries and export facilities in the corpus christi area including the south texas gateway terminal in which psxp has 25 ownership the terminal will have two deepwater marine docks 8 5 million barrels of storage capacity and up 800 000 barrels per day of throughput capacity the terminal is expected to start up in the third quarter of 2020 the liberty pipeline will provide transportation with the growing rockies and bakken production areas to cushing oklahoma we own a 50 interest and will construct and operate liberty the red oak pipeline system will connect cushing and the permian basin to multiple locations along the gulf coast including corpus christi ingleside houston and beaumont we own a 50 interest and will operate red oak the liberty and red oak pipelines are backed by long term commitments and we are targeting initial service in the first half of 2021 we re adding three 150 000 barrel per day fractionators at the sweeny hub fracs 2 and 3 are on track to start up in the fourth quarter of 2020 frac 4 is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021 the fracs are backed by long term customer commitments upon completion of frac 4 sweeny hub will have 550 000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity we re adding 2 2 million barrels of crude oil storage at our beaumont terminal to meet the increased need for gulf coast export infrastructure upon completion in the first quarter of 2020 the terminal will have 16 8 million barrels of crude and product storage capacity in addition we are constructing a new 200 000 barrel per day dock this project is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2020 resulting in a total dock capacity of 800 000 barrels per day at our beaumont terminal in chemicals cpchem is expanding its strategic partnership with qatar petroleum to develop petrochemical assets in the us gulf coast and in qatar pending final investment decisions these world scale projects will add ethylene and high density polyethylene capacity and advantaged feedstock locations this further enhances cpchem s leading polyethylene position despite the world s growing demand for polymers in refining we re upgrading one of the fccs at the sweeny refinery to increase production of higher value petrochemical products and higher octane gasoline the project is on track to be completed in the second quarter of 2020 the ponca city refinery we re upgrading fcc to increase yields of higher value products and to process more advantaged feedstocks this project expect to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2020 we recently canceled the renewable diesel project at our ferndale refinery permitting uncertainties were leading to project delays and increased costs impacting the viability of this project our renewable diesel strategy has not changed we continue to pursue renewable diesel opportunities that leverage our existing infrastructure supply network and capabilities in marketing during the fourth quarter we entered into a retail marketing joint venture with operations primarily on the us west coast the joint venture currently operates 580 retail sites in addition the joint venture is expected to close on an acquisition of approximately 100 additional sites in the first half of this year the joint venture enables increased long term placement of our refinery production and increases our exposure to retail margins our strategy and commitment to capital discipline remains steadfast we re focused on operating excellence project execution maintaining financial strength while providing strong returns to our shareholders so with that i ll turn the call over to kevin to review the financials kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you greg hello everyone starting with an overview on slide 4 we summarize our financial results for the year 2019 adjusted earnings were 3 7 billion or 8 05 per share we generated 5 6 billion of operating cash flow excluding working capital distributions from equity affiliates totaled 2 1 billion including 831 million from cpchem at the end of the fourth quarter the net debt to capital ratio was 27 our adjusted after tax return on capital employed for the year was 11 slide 5 shows the change in cash during the year we started the year with 3 billion in cash on our balance sheet cash from operations was 5 6 billion excluding working capital there was a working capital use of 830 million mainly related to an increase in receivables associated with the timing of crude oil sales at year end consolidated debt increased by 500 million due to issuances at psxp during the year we funded 3 5 billion of adjusted capital spending and returned 3 2 billion to shareholders including 1 7 billion of share repurchases our ending cash balance was 1 6 billion slide 6 summarizes our fourth quarter results adjusted earnings were 689 million or 1 54 per share operating cash flow was 1 7 billion including a working capital benefit of approximately 500 million capital spending for the quarter was 1 3 billion we invested 880 million in growth projects including 260 million of capital associated with the retail marketing joint venture we returned 810 million to shareholders through 398 million of dividends and 412 million of share repurchases we ended the year with 441 million shares outstanding moving to slide 7 this slide highlights change in pre tax income by segment from the third quarter to the fourth quarter during the period adjusted earnings decreased 713 million driven by lower results in all segments the fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 24 driven by adjustments to our tax liabilities to reflect a full year adjusted effective tax rate of 21 slide 8 shows our midstream results fourth quarter adjusted pre tax income was 405 million a decrease of 35 million from the previous quarter transportation delivered another record quarter with adjusted pre tax income of 250 million up 2 million from the previous quarter the increase was due to higher pipeline and terminal volumes that were mostly offset by increased planned maintenance costs ngl and other adjusted pre tax income decreased 49 million driven by lower propane and butane trading results following a strong third quarter as well as inventory impacts at the sweeny hub the export facility averaged a record 13 cargoes per month and the fractionator ran at 107 utilization dcp midstream adjusted pre tax income of 35 million was up 12 million from the previous quarter the increase reflects the effect of lower depreciation and amortization following the third quarter impairments as well as our increased ownership of lp units following the elimination of idrs turning to chemicals on slide 9 fourth quarter adjusted pre tax income was 173 million down 96 million from the third quarter olefins and polyolefins adjusted pre tax income was 154 million the 97 million decrease from the previous quarter is due to lower polyethylene margins and seasonally lower volumes as well as higher turnaround and maintenance costs global o p utilization was 97 adjusted pre tax income for sa s decreased 1 million during the fourth quarter we received 143 million in cash distributions from cpchem next on slide 10 we will cover refining the fourth quarter crude utilization rate was 97 and clean product yield was 84 both are consistent with the prior quarter this was a heavy turnaround quarter with 232 million of costs up from 120 million in the third quarter in addition our share of wrb turnaround expenses amounted to 41 million this quarter refining fourth quarter adjusted pre tax income was 345 million down 494 million from last quarter the chart provides a regional view of the change from the prior period the atlantic basin adjusted pre tax income decreased 218 million due to lower gasoline cracks as well as premium coke inventory and margin impacts in the gulf coast the 108 million decrease was driven by lower product margins and the lake charles refinery turnaround this was partially offset by widening gulf coast crude differentials in the central corridor the decrease was due to a decline in the gasoline market crack that was partially offset by widening wcs crude differentials in the west coast the decrease was driven by turnaround activity at the san francisco refinery slide 11 covers market capture the 3 2 1 market crack for the fourth quarter was 12 45 per barrel compared to 14 60 per barrel in the third quarter our realized margin was 9 50 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 76 market capture in the previous quarter was 77 market capture was impacted by the configuration of our refineries we make less gasoline and more distillate than premise in the 3 2 1 market crack during the quarter the distillate crack increased approximately 1 per barrel and the gasoline crack declined by almost 4 per barrel losses from secondary products of 2 35 per barrel increased 1 28 per barrel from the previous quarter due to premium coke impacts partially offset by increased butane blending into gasoline our feedstock advantage of 1 02 per barrel was improved by 0 99 per barrel from the prior quarter as we benefited from widening wcs and gulf coast crude differentials the other category mainly includes costs associated with rins outgoing freight product differentials and inventory impacts the other category reduced realized margins by 0 54 per barrel moving to marketing and specialties on slide 12 adjusted fourth quarter pre tax income was 287 million 211 million lower than the third quarter marketing and other decreased 203 million from lower margins driven by less favorable market conditions and seasonality as well as higher costs associated with a one time true up to a branded marketing agreement the marketing results included a 62 million benefit from 2019 biodiesel blender tax credits specialties decreased 8 million due to lower finished lubricant margins we reimaged 532 domestic branded sites during the fourth quarter bringing the total to approximately 4 200 since the start of the program in our international marketing business we reimaged 82 european sites since the start of the program in early 2019 refined product exports in the fourth quarter were 157 000 barrels per day compared with 220 000 barrels per day in the third quarter on slide 13 the corporate and other segment had adjusted pre tax costs of 211 million an increase of 33 million from the prior quarter the increase is primarily due to higher environmental net interest and employee related expenses this concludes my review of the financial and operating results next i ll cover a few outlook items for the first quarter and the full year in chemicals we expect the first quarter global o p utilization rate to be in the mid 90s in refining we expect the first quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be about 90 and pre tax turnaround expenses to be between 280 million and 330 million we anticipate first quarter corporate and other costs to come in between 200 million and 220 million pre tax for 2020 we plan full year turnaround expenses to be between 630 million and 680 million pre tax we expect corporate and other costs to be in the range of 800 million to 850 million pre tax for the year we anticipate full year d a of about 1 4 billion and finally we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the low 20 range with that we ll now open the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session phil gresh with jpmorgan phil gresh jpmorgan analyst yeah good morning greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer hi phil phil gresh jpmorgan analyst hi good morning can you hear me greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer yes phil gresh jpmorgan analyst okay so first question just looking at the quarter here i mean i think several of your peers particularly in refining put up stronger results relative to expectations and this is obviously a tougher quarter for you guys so i was hoping it might be possible you could disaggregate that for us or help us understand what you think the differences there were obviously the turnarounds were called out as a factor but i m also looking at secondary products here as a pretty big headwind in the atlantic basin so i m wondering if needle coke was the factor there as well so just if you could help us think through some of the moving pieces thanks jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah so i think as you look at the quarter the turnaround activity was heavily focused in october and october was actually one of the better margin environments that we had last year and so our turnarounds were focused in that period margin softened substantially kind of in the back half of november and in december the turnaround expense 232 million was more than our guidance and up substantially from the 120 million in the third quarter i think as you look at our premium coke products there are two primary markets there the steel industry and ev sales for batteries both were weak with weaker gdp and manufacturing activity impacting steel as well as lower sales volume or disappointing sales volumes in evs both china and india had declining sales in 2019 relative to 2018 as you know we ve extended our coke product line to serve the battery market which is has a substantially faster growth profile and the car manufacturers are investing significantly to increase manufacturing capability so we expect that growth to return and balance that market phil gresh jpmorgan analyst okay thanks the second question would just be on the chemical side of things obviously it seems like everybody has been getting a lot of questions here on the fundamental picture so greg would love to get your latest thoughts about how you re viewing this cycle and the pace of potential recovery and as you look ahead at the investment opportunities that you outlined in your prepared remarks does the cycle situation right now concern you at all with respect to those possible investments moving forward thank you greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer so hey phil i think first of all we re constructive chemicals in medium long term there is no question that margins today are cyclical trough at least they feel like it any way at this point in time yeah i think there s a couple of tailwinds we saw some economic slowdown globally as we came in in the back half of 19 certainly the tariffs have had some depressing effect on global margins whether it s 0 05 or 0 10 or somewhere in between but certainly it has had an impact it s quite a bit of capacity coming on in 19 and also in 20 and 21 so i suspect that there is going to be some headwinds on margins as we move into 20 and 21 just from the new capacity coming on globally as i think about how cpchem is positioned i like their hand and how they re going to play their hand first of all assets in the middle east and in the us gulf coast are going to be an advantage from a feedstock location and today an lpg cracker on the gulf coast is probably 400 to 500 a ton advantage over a naphtha cracker in asia or in europe so i think that s good and then as we look and kind of dissect the product portfolio cpchem s exposure is really on the high density polyethylene side and so that s not going to be quite as impacted as some of the other ethylene derivatives as we look out in 2021 now in terms of the fids for the new projects these are five year projects to build we can t call the cycle that that closely we probably don t hit an fid until late 2020 or early 21 on the first project so we ve got some time certainly to look at it but i would say today that we would be on track to improve those projects and move forward with those projects just given what we see around the supply and demand balances for high density polyethylene where cpchem sits in kind of that ranking of assets kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer phil i would say when we look at the ihs full chain margin it averaged 0 165 in the fourth quarter december was down slightly below 0 15 per pound and we ve seen that rally back year to date about 0 165 back flat with the fourth quarter average operator doug terreson from evercore isi please go ahead your line is open doug terreson evercore isi analyst good morning everybody jeff dietert vice president investor relations hi doug doug terreson evercore isi analyst so greg over the past several years phillips 66 has consistently posted better results than peers and especially better than the super majors and especially in the downstream and it seems like advantedge66 is going to sustain that performance over the medium term so my question regards this outlook and specifically whether you feel that there are advantages that you have or disadvantages that you don t have that help explain performance and also how the advantedge66 plan is progressing and then second what role does stronger corporate governance play into it in your view meaning since you re one of only a few energy companies that benchmarks performance against diversified peers which is obviously a higher bar for return on capital than other energy companies and reasons that disciplined capital management would be pretty high emphasis so i ve got two questions one insight into competitive advantages progress on advantedge66 and also the role that corporate governance plays into capital management at phillips 66 greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer okay well thanks for the question doug so working backwards may be i think strong governance starts with a strong board of directors and we have a strong board of directors they re fully engaged in strategy discussions we don t have a board of directors meeting at phillips 66 where we don t talk about the strategy of the company we don t talk about the capital allocation so those are two topics we cover every board meeting i think that as we think about our methodology and our criteria and the 60 40 60 reinvested back in our company 40 return back to shareholders and some flexibility around that given where we the opportunities that are in front of us to invest and where shares are trading but over a long period of time that s where we want to be i mean that is all contingent upon having opportunities to invest in that exceed our hurdle rates and if you look at kind of 2017 18 19 so last three year period our return on capital employed is 13 our nearest refining peers are kind of high single digits and by the way that s an after tax return on capital employed so we re always interested in returns and if we can t find good return projects we re simply not going to invest and then you think about in 2019 returning 3 2 billion back to our shareholders through a strong secured growing dividend and buying our shares when they trade below intrinsic value that s just fundamental to our capital allocation strategy and so you ll see us continue to do that to your first question around the portfolio what differentiates us i think there s a couple of things one we do have a strong diversified portfolio we ve got a good portfolio of refining assets we ve built a strong midstream business 2 3 billion 2 4 billion of ebitda in our midstream business now really if you go back to 2012 excluding dcp we were kind of about 450 million of ebitda in our midstream business so we ve built a significantly stronger midstream business at phillips 66 we ve got a great marketing specialties business then you add on top of that the chemicals business so i like the diversification that we have across the portfolio it creates investable opportunities for us it s a portfolio that generate strong returns and i would say that phillips 66 is a great operator we re consistently one of the safest operators in the industry we re generally at or better than the industry average on operating rates and so we operate really well and this organization has demonstrated the ability to execute well on these capital projects we went back to our board and looked at all of our investments from 2012 to 2019 and we re right on the money in terms of what we said we re going to put the assets on the ground for and importantly we re right on the money in terms of what we promised to deliver in terms of the earnings from those assets which is in my 40 years in the business that s probably as good as it gets doug doug terreson evercore isi analyst yeah and then also greg it seems like the advantedge66 plan will help you guys sustain this performance over the medium term is there anything to report there on that project greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer i think consistent with what we said at our investor day we still see that there is 1 2 billion of opportunity for us we hope to drive 60 70 of that to the bottom line in terms of seeing that in ebitda so you ll see that in terms of margin capture you ll see that in terms of cost reduction you ll see that in terms of capital avoidance but also cost avoidance across the enterprise but more importantly from that changing the way of working for our people at the end of the day it s going to be a much better place to work we re going to have better tools to make better decisions we ll work smarter we ll be more agile we ll be more efficient and i think that will differentiate from our peers now everyone is going to move this way doug at some point in time you either go digital or you die in this business but i think we re out at least i think in the lead position here operator neil mehta from goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open neil mehta goldman sachs analyst yeah thanks very much guys so first question is on the crude side and get wanted to get your perspective on how you think about western canadian crude discounts but also some of the barrels that you import from opec or from alaska that are more medium and heavy in nature western canadian differentials are wide right now we re trying to get a sense of the sustainability of that from your perspective and with those medium and sours we re just trying to think about how the upcoming opec meeting could influence the outcomes there kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah i think that s a good question with the some of the production in canada returning from curtailment with the special production allowance rail waivers we ve seen more production coming into the market in canada there s another 150 000 barrels a day or so of new production schedule to start up in 2020 so there s more supply coming in into the market that has supported wider differentials here in the first quarter as you know we have about a 30 day lag on delivery there so the wide discounts in december will really show up in 1q we expect wcs discounts to follow the normal seasonal pattern with wider winter differentials and then they get tighter in the summer as the production companies perform maintenance i think as we look with the new imo environment in the wider high sulfur fuel oil discounts we re expecting to see not only your historical transportation differentials but probably some increased penalty for sulfur content and so we re expecting that to occur on the gulf coast we ve moved away from a lot of imports from many of the opec countries we ve reduced exposure there as you know we don t pull anything in from venezuela and so i think there is less exposure there from a direct perspective but indirectly with more opec barrels eventually coming into the market those will be heavy sour barrels which should widen the heavy sour discount i think also as you look into 2020 there s more canadian heavy barrels coming in the market saudi kuwait are bringing up production in the neutral zone which is heavy sour production we ve got some incremental gulf of mexico barrels which are medium and sour and new production in norway is 28 api and 0 8 sulfur so lower quality than a normal north sea barrel neil mehta goldman sachs analyst thanks kevin just sticking with the macro and we ve got the bull and the bear on imo on the call in jeff versus greg but i just wanted to get both of your perspectives on how that dynamic is changing recognizing there is a lot of there are a lot of other variables that are affecting particularly the distillate side of the equation but love a refresh on the views there jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah i ll start and greg can clarify what i miss i think in isolation imo is a positive factor for complex refiners like ours obviously there are a number of other considerations high sulfur fuel oil has widened to about a 20 discount relative to brent the 10 year average is 12 a barrel so imo has caused some wider discounts there it was 30 a barrel in december so it s come in a little bit but if you look at the 2020 forward curve as of last year it was trading 20 to 25 under brent so we re kind of at the low end of that range to the industry s credit the transition to the low sulfur marine fuel market has gone very smoothly very few compatibility issues or fonar fuel non available reports i think there will be strong enforcement very low sulfur fuel oil has been rapidly adopt adopted with its high energy contact viscosity and lubricating qualities very low sulfur fuel oil is actually trading wider than ulsd in some markets i think the disappointment has been on the diesel side and diesel has been weak following manufacturing activity that s been disappointing recently mild winter weather i think as we look at demand the first quarter is typically the weakest quarter of the year and gasoline diesel demand decline over 1 million barrels a day from 4q to 1q marine fuel if you look at some of the major ports singapore in the us houston la long beach they all have seasonal trends where the first quarter is the lowest demand quarter for marine transportation so as that demand picks up we could see some improvement and then finally i think with the weakness in gasoline cracks that s pulling low sulfur vgo out of the fccs and into the marine fuel market as we move into the summer grade gasoline season that s not likely to be the case so that probably cleaned up the gasoline market faster than otherwise would have been the case in the spring and provide some incremental diesel demand for the marine fuel market in the summer greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer good job jeff operator roger read from wells fargo please go ahead your line is open roger read wells fargo analyst hey thanks good morning maybe just to come back to something that was talked about a little in the fall and probably becomes a bigger issue this spring and ties into that whole description of the gasoline market but on tier 3 is there anything that you ve seen where that s affecting the market or do you have any particular thoughts as we switch from winter grade to summer grade and butane comes out whether or not we ll see any impacts from tier 3 jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah i think it s a good point we re very well positioned for tier 3 the vast majority of our tier spending has already occurred and so we re in good shape there we produce much higher premium gasoline as a percent of total than the industry average we haven t seen octane strengthening yet but i think like you we re looking to the shift in rvp and summer grade and taking cheap butane is a good blend stock for the winter grade we are seeing alkylates prices strengthened in anticipation of the summer as you know we recently completed our lake charles isom unit which will provide high octane material high octane blend stocks as well so i think we re looking to the summer to see evidence of the importance of tier 3 roger read wells fargo analyst okay great thanks and changing gears completely there midstream side of the business greg i was wondering it seems like things have gotten tougher in the outlook for a lot of other companies in the midstream is there anything as you look at it where it might make more sense to be acquisitive rather than build or do you need to see valuations and poroject i shouldn t say project but specific facilities come on the market would have to discount quite a bit from current levels to fit within your return criteria greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer yeah there s nothing today that would we d be interested in just simply from a return criteria part roger i think that but the nice thing that we re really well positioned certainly for 20 and 21 we ve got a great portfolio of projects that we re executing post 21 we ll see and if we can find investable opportunities we ll invest we don t we won t so i we re not concerned at this point in time in terms of the opportunities that we have before us we ll continue to watch what goes on in that space but there is really nothing out there today that we would be interested in doing in the midstream space operator paul cheng from scotiabank please go ahead your line is open paul cheng scotiabank analyst hey guys good morning jeff dietert vice president investor relations hey paul paul cheng scotiabank analyst may we have seen a slowdown in the export to mexico and latam greg wondering that based on your market intelligence that has that slow down is driven by the core demand over there is slowing down or that is i mean every year that we have to fall in houston so yeah we have fall but it doesn t seems like year over year that that should be a incremental factors so i m trying to understand that what is the dynamic we are seeing jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah i think paul with regard to mexico you remember a few quarters back there were pipelines that were shut down as people were stealing product off the pipelines and i m not sure we fully recovered all the demand there i think that may have suppressed some demand in mexico we are seeing that as a continued good market for product exports i think if you look at our exports in the fourth quarter they were down a little bit and that was really driven by some of our export refineries being in maintenance and in some cases finding higher priced domestic markets than what was available in the export market but we expect to see continue to see some growth in the latin american market from an export perspective paul cheng scotiabank analyst and jeff i think you guys are receiving about 300 000 barrel per day of wcs net to you i think another 100 000 maybe going to the jv partner with the increase in the wcs production is there any opportunity for you guys to receive more or that is something that you guys are working on jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah we are constantly assessing the availability of transportation out of canada and our ability to access more barrels there attractively priced both from a mid continent and the gulf coast perspective and so we re constantly assessing those opportunities and our commercial people take advantage of the opportunities when they present themselves but as far as long term commitments for rail or something like that we don t see that at this point operator prashant rao from citigroup please go ahead your line is open prashant rao citigroup analyst thank you for taking the question thank you good morning thanks for taking the question my first one is on renewables and biofuels i was wondering greg if you could talk a bit more about the decision to cancel the ferndale project apart from the permitting and regulatory hurdles i mean what you said in the prepared remarks were there any constraints on feedstock sourcing or developing that network and then maybe taking a bigger picture view on the other projects in the portfolio of san francisco humber and the offtake in marketing in nevada could you help us to understand how these differ from ferndale not only in terms of the regulatory and permitting but maybe also in terms of the feedstock resources greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer i so first of all it wasn t a feedstock sourcing concern that we had at ferndale it was strictly around the ability to permit the project there and so we withdrew when you think about what we re doing in humber what we re doing in san francisco these are existing assets that we re either repurposing or utilizing differently and those are certainly very easy to do easy to feedstock source and we ll continue to look for other opportunities in our portfolio the deal with ryze is essentially we re responsible for securing the feedstock and then we have an offtake agreement there so think of it like a tolling arrangement and we have no concerns there so as we thought about how we re going to approach the renewable strategy for us we want to use existing assets where we could do that we want to partner with people that had existing technology and capabilities and then look at grassroots investments again in a partnership which is where the ferndale one really felt that would have been circa 800 million to a 1 billion investment in cooperation with reg so we ll see i think that we certainly have other places that we could build a grassroots facility and you should expect that our strategy really hasn t changed it may not be at the ferndale location prashant rao citigroup analyst okay thank you that s helpful and then my second question so on esg the discussion seems to be progressing pretty quickly overseas and focus on decarbonization is really stronger than it was even a year ago and it seems the discussion here in the states maybe following a similar path but perhaps at a delay so what s going on overseas p66 has been a leader in positive esg momentum within the us hydrocarbon space so i just want to get your thoughts on looking ahead if there is a greater focus on decarbonization among investors what are some of the strategies to balance this with and still maintaining p66 s strong return on capital and your low cost of capital across the portfolio and particularly if you think about growth capex decisions both of what s currently in the portfolio and maybe overall the longer term opportunities there greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer yeah well i think maybe you want to start with i think the us is a world leader in technology and innovation our economy is the envy of the rest of the world we re a world leader in energy production we re a world leader in emissions reductions including greenhouse gas emissions and so i think that there is a path forward that would say we can develop our energy resources responsibly sustainably we can have a strong growing economy and we can have a better environment so they are not mutually exclusive at all in our way of thinking as we think about the opportunity set in front of us we re investing in next generation technologies for lower carbon economy so things like our opv and organic photovoltaics our solid oxide fuel cells you ve seen us introduced two loops one for heavy duty trucks one for light duty vehicles that increased the mileage by 4 5 as a direct reduction in greenhouse gas emissions so i think that you ll see phillips 66 and many companies frankly approach this problem from many different angles specifically around low carbon investments i think it s a good thing i think we should encourage our companies to invest in low carbon technologies and we should send them to do that but as we look out two and three decades we still see that fossil fuels are going to be a majority part of the energy mix just because you re not going to be able to get there from here with the current technologies that we see operator doug leggate from bank of america please go ahead your line is open doug leggate bank of america analyst hi good morning everybody greg i wonder if i could take you back to midstream again and you did a pretty thorough job of walking us through the assets that you have coming online and your working interest and so i m just curious about what is the thinking in terms of the timing if and when those may be dropped the mlp or do you have different funds for those versus your historical pattern greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer well i maybe we start from the point that i mean all those midstream assets are qualifying income and they could certainly they could certainly go through the mlp we ve resisted and we will continue to resist specific information about timing of drops when those drops could occur i think we ve spoken publicly about our interest in growing our midstream business at psxp it s an efficient way for us to do that giving where psxp trades and the yields that it generates and then you think about the uplift in some of the parts we re still incented to grow psxp as fast as we can and so our view is that you grow it efficiently but it s got to pay its own way too equity markets are closed in our view beyond some dribs and drabs around the atm program but generally great balance sheet at psxp executing 800 million plus capital program this year at psxp so at some point in the future you should expect these assets should logically end up at psxp and but the timing we just don t go through that doug doug leggate bank of america analyst okay just a reminder can you tell me what the ebitda is associated with those assets held at your c corp level kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer we ve got a 800 million to 900 million of ebitda at still at psx and growing is of course is we re bringing on these new projects too doug leggate bank of america analyst that that s the qualifying income right kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer that s right doug leggate bank of america analyst okay thanks my follow up is just very quickly on turnarounds obviously your turnaround expense is up a bit this year just as for phillips specifically but also for the industry i think jeff touched on this a little bit but do you anticipate that we re going to see that contributing to clean up of the overhang we ve seen for gasoline in particular right now and just specific to phillips is there anything unusual this year or is this normal course of business jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah i think that s a good question doug i think there was a lot of speculation that given the high turnaround activity in 2019 that there was a lot of activity that had been moved forward out of 20 into 2019 and a lot of the tunraround activity is on a pretty strict schedule for replacement and so we are seeing 2020 turnaround activity being relatively high for the industry as well you look at the gulf coast pad 3 looks to be a very active turnaround season this spring with a lot of fcc an alkylation units being included in that planned work so i think we re continuing to see turnaround activity in 2020 as well i think that s one of the factors that could help clean up the gasoline market operator paul sankey from mizuho please go ahead your line is open paul sankey mizuho analyst hi everyone sorry for the sort of detailed question but as regards the situation in china i was wondering in reference to your contracts and how it takes time for these things to feed through when do you think you ll be able to say with some degree of certainty what s actually happening to markets over there thanks jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah it s a good question paul i think it s still early i mean we are seeing i think some impact on diesel demand diesel cracks jet jet cracks i think we are starting to see some impact on freight rates it s really early it s a little bit speculative to say that but i think we are getting some indication of impact already it s really hard to measure and i think it s going to be difficult to determine the depth and the duration of this event so i think there s still a huge amount of uncertainty out there as you well know there is about 300 000 barrels a day of impact from sars and in fact you ve included it in one of your reports china s economy is much bigger today than it was at that time but i think paul we re still dealing with a lot of uncertainty as to the impact on the coronavirus greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer paul i was just going to say petrochemical same thing right i think we re concerned we ll continue to watch petrochemicals right now pricing is kind of moving up a little bit in asia when you look at petrochemical inventories they re at five year lows so and so we ll just we ll just have to see and watch this but i agree with jeff it s just almost too early to make a call on this but it certainly has our attention and we re watching it closely paul sankey mizuho analyst yeah understood i mean obviously this thing really only took off in the past week i just wondered how long you thought it would be before you could actually say we now know that this has happened given the time it takes for all this stuff to move around the world greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer yeah jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah it s certainly impacting commodity markets the volumes we ll have to keep an eye on paul sankey mizuho analyst yeah i was thinking more obviously in terms of real volumes if i could switch you had a tough october in many ways because it was a good environment and you had downtime give a sense for what your cost opportunity was or your opportunity cost was there and could you just go over again the outlook for this year in terms of your turnaround i know you ve addressed it somewhat but it s interesting to think how skewed this quarter might have been if it hadn t been for the october turnaround thanks jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah it s a good point we don t typically comment on lpos but i think if you assume most of the downtime occurred in april and adjust and kind of model october versus november versus december and i think it would get you close we have provided guidance on turnaround activity first quarter we do have some turnaround activity planned as well and we ve got the full year guidance there also so i might just lean to that guidance operator manav gupta from credit suisse please go ahead your line is open manav gupta credit suisse analyst hi jeff can you clarify where you are with the permitting process of both the red oak and liberty and liberty specifically because there were some news items out there and i was hoping you could set the record straight over there jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah we are moving forward we re getting some feedback there is that i ll go ahead here we re moving forward we ve ordered the pipe for liberty and taken delivery of pipe the permitting process is moving forward as expected so we re very much moving forward as anticipated there it s a first half 2021 in service date and all systems are go on both liberty as well as red oak manav gupta credit suisse analyst a quick follow up on the marketing and specialties side we saw a slight jump in the capex between 3q and 4q about 264 million i m assuming this is associated with the jv payment of the west coast thing and but the press release is saying you re going to acquire 100 more stores in 1q or in this in the 2020 so i m trying to understand would there be a second payment associated with these 100 stores or all the payment has already been made here kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah manav it s kevin so yeah you re right that the variance in capex for that segment is all attributable to the formation of that joint venture so 260 million went in which is almost the full variance quarter over quarter the additional acquisition that was referred to in the press release does have some additional spend in whenever that timing whenever that acquisition closes there will be some additional spend on that it s not of the same magnitude as the initial upfront jv formation though so you ll see that coming through whenever that closes operator matthew blair from tudor pickering holt please go ahead your line is open matthew blair tudor pickering holt analyst hey good morning everyone given the discounted high sulfur fuel oil prices in the fourth quarter were you able to increase your runs of hsfo as a feedstock of your refineries and if so can you provide any sort of numbers on the incremental volumes or ebitda uplift and i guess if not was the constraint economic or more just like equipment related jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah it s a good question matthew i would highlight one of the things we talked about at the investor day were some refining projects that allow us to upgrade over 30 000 barrels a day a high sulfur fuel oil to very low sulfur sub 0 5 blend stock and we accomplished that late last year and think there is actually some upside to those volumes so we are moving some very low sulfur product into the market we are finding opportunities to take advantage of dislocations associated with imo i think not only on the high sulfur fuel oil side but we ve been able to increase the sales of low sulfur production into the market to capture some of the premiums on low sulfur material we ve also been able to bring high sulfur material in as a feedstock for our processing units as you know we have substantial coking and treating capacity to upgrade heavy sour streams i think you might look in our supplemental information we provide both our crude throughput as well as our total process volumes and the difference there would probably give you a good indication on intermediate feedstocks and a lot of those being heavy sour product matthew blair tudor pickering holt analyst great thanks for the color and then on the chem side greg i was hoping you could share some insights on just the asia pe markets we ve seen margins dip negative for a little bit now haven t really seen shutdowns are those coming in your opinion or i guess do other regions need to cut back first greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer i think our view is that probably asia and europe are probably under the most pressure today and you would expect there could be some cuts there also you re starting to see some price movement in asia though so that s i think that s a sign that people need to do something about the margin environment they find themselves in and then i would just say tariffs are still kind of an overhang particularly to china and so we ll see where all that plays out but yeah i think it s pretty tough margin environment out there right now operator thank you we have now reached the time limit available for questions i will now turn the call back over to jeff jeff dietert vice president investor relations thank you very much for your interest in phillips 66 if you have any follow up

the gray oak pipeline midstream performed well delivering another record quarter in the transportation business refining and chemicals ran at 97 utilization our turnaround activity and weak product and petrochemical margins impacted our financial results during 2019 we made significant progress on executing our growth strategy in midstream and chemicals operating excellence remains a top priority for us and we maintain our industry leading performance we can always do better we believe that zero incidents zero accidents workplace is achievable and it s a goal we work hard for daily midstream completed a number of growth projects and delivered strong operating performance contributing to another year of record adjusted earnings for that segment for the year refining ran at 94 utilization while cpchem operated 97 o p utilization in 2019 we delivered a 34 total shareholder return for phillips 66 shareholders phillips 66 partners is integral to our midstream strategy psxp delivered strong operating performance eliminated incentive distribution rights achieved a 56 total unitholder return in 2019 phillips 66 partners continues to be a leading master limited partnership with a strong financial position attractive growth opportunities and disciplined capital allocation we announced our advantedge66 business transformation program in late 2019 advantedge66 is leveraging technology to transform the way we run our operations execute projects and make decisions due to this program we expect to deliver 1 2 billion of enhancements by the end of 2021 we re committed to strong shareholder distributions during the year we returned 3 2 billion through dividends and share repurchases in 2019 we increased the quarterly dividend 12 5 and announced a 3 billion increase to our share repurchase program since 2012 we ve returned 26 billion to shareholders and reduced our initial shares outstanding by 33 we made significant progress on our key projects these projects will contribute to future cash generation and create shareholder value phillips 66 partners commenced initial operations on the gray oak pipeline in november and we anticipate full service in the second quarter of 2020 the 900 000 barrel per day pipeline will transport crude oil from the permian and the eagle ford to the texas gulf coast including our sweeny refinery phillips 66 partners owns a 42 25 interest in the pipeline gray oak will connect to multiple refineries and export facilities in the corpus christi area including the south texas gateway terminal in which psxp has 25 ownership the terminal will have two deepwater marine docks 8 5 million barrels of storage capacity and up 800 000 barrels per day of throughput capacity the terminal is expected to start up in the third quarter of 2020 the liberty pipeline will provide transportation with the growing rockies and bakken production areas to cushing oklahoma we own a 50 interest and will construct and operate liberty the red oak pipeline system will connect cushing and the permian basin to multiple locations along the gulf coast including corpus christi ingleside houston and beaumont we own a 50 interest and will operate red oak the liberty and red oak pipelines are backed by long term commitments and we are targeting initial service in the first half of 2021 we re adding three 150 000 barrel per day fractionators at the sweeny hub fracs 2 and 3 are on track to start up in the fourth quarter of 2020 frac 4 is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021 the fracs are backed by long term customer commitments upon completion of frac 4 sweeny hub will have 550 000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity we re adding 22 2 million barrels of crude oil storage at our beaumont terminal to meet the increased need for gulf coast export infrastructure upon completion in the first quarter of 2020 the terminal will have 16 8 million barrels of crude and product storage capacity in addition we are constructing a new 200 000 barrel per day dock this project is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2020 resulting in a total dock capacity of 800 000 barrels per day at our beaumont terminal in chemicals cpchem is expanding its strategic partnership with qatar petroleum to develop petrochemical assets in the us gulf coast and in qatar pending final investment decisions these world scale projects will add ethylene and high density polyethylene capacity and advantaged feedstock locations this further enhances cpchem s leading polyethylene position despite the world s growing demand for polymers in refining we re upgrading one of the fcc s at the sweeny refinery to increase production of higher value petrochemical products and higher octane gasoline the project is on track to be completed in the second quarter of 2020 the ponca city refinery we re upgrading fcc to increase yields of higher value products and to process more advantaged feedstocks this project expect to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2020 we recently canceled the renewable diesel project at our ferndale refinery permitting uncertainties were leading to project delays and increased costs impacting the viability of this project our renewable diesel strategy has not changed we continue to pursue renewable diesel opportunities that leverage our existing infrastructure supply network and capabilities in marketing during the fourth quarter we entered into a retail marketing joint venture with operations primarily on the us west coast the joint venture currently operates 580 retail sites in addition the joint venture is expected to close on an acquisition of approximately 100 additional sites in the first half of this year the joint venture enables increased long term placement of our refinery production and increases our exposure to retail margins our strategy and commitment to capital discipline remains steadfast we re focused on operating excellence project execution maintaining financial strength while providing strong returns to our shareholders so with that i ll turn the call over to kevin to review the financials kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you greg hello everyone starting with an overview on slide 4 we summarize our financial results for the year 2019 adjusted earnings were 3 7 billion or 8 05 per share we generated 5 6 billion of operating cash flow excluding working capital distributions from equity affiliates totaled 2 1 billion including 831 million from cpchem at the end of the fourth quarter the net debt to capital ratio was 27 our adjusted after tax return on capital employed for the year was 11 slide 5 shows the change in cash during the year we started the year with 3 billion in cash on our balance sheet cash from operations was 5 6 billion excluding working capital there was a working capital use of 830 million mainly related to an increase in receivables associated with the timing of crude oil sales at year end consolidated debt increased by 500 million due to issuances at psxp during the year we funded 3 5 billion of adjusted capital spending and returned 3 2 billion to shareholders including 1 7 billion of share repurchases our ending cash balance was 1 6 billion slide 6 summarizes our fourth quarter results adjusted earnings were 689 million or 1 54 per share operating cash flow was 1 7 billion including a working capital benefit of approximately 500 million capital spending for the quarter was 1 3 billion we invested 880 million in growth projects including 260 million of capital associated with the retail marketing joint venture we returned 810 million to shareholders through 398 million of dividends and 412 million of share repurchases we ended the year with 441 million shares outstanding moving to slide 7 this slide highlights change in pre tax income by segment from the third quarter to the fourth quarter during the period adjusted earnings decreased 713 million driven by lower results in all segments the fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 24 driven by adjustments to our tax liabilities to reflect a full year adjusted effective tax rate of 21 slide 8 shows our midstream results fourth quarter adjusted pre tax income was 405 million a decrease of 35 million from the previous quarter transportation delivered another record quarter with adjusted pre tax income of 250 million up 2 million from the previous quarter the increase was due to higher pipeline and terminal volumes that were mostly offset by increased planned maintenance costs ngl and other adjusted pre tax income decreased 49 million driven by lower propane and butane trading results following a strong third quarter as well as inventory impacts at the sweeny hub the export facility averaged a record 13 cargoes per month and the fractionator ran at 107 utilization dcp midstream adjusted pre tax income of 35 million was up 12 million from the previous quarter the increase reflects the effect of lower depreciation and amortization following the third quarter impairments as well as our increased ownership of lp units following the elimination of idrs turning to chemicals on slide 9 fourth quarter adjusted pre tax income was 173 million down 96 million from the third quarter olefins and polyolefins adjusted pre tax income was 154 million the 97 million decrease from the previous quarter is due to lower polyethylene margins and seasonally lower volumes as well as higher turnaround and maintenance costs global o p utilization was 97 adjusted pre tax income for sa s decreased 1 million during the fourth quarter we received 143 million in cash distributions from cpchem next on slide 10 we will cover refining the fourth quarter crude utilization rate was 97 clean product yield was 80 both are consistent with the prior quarter this was a heavy turnaround quarter with 232 million of costs up from 120 million in the third quarter in addition our share of wrb turnaround expenses amounted to 41 million this quarter refining fourth quarter adjusted pre tax income was 345 million down 494 million from last quarter the chart provides a regional view of the change from the prior period the atlantic basin adjusted pre tax income decreased 218 million due to lower gasoline cracks as well as premium coke inventory and margin impacts in the gulf coast the 108 million decrease was driven by lower product margins and the lake charles refinery turnaround this was partially offset by widening gulf coast crude differentials in the central corridor the decrease was due to a decline in the gasoline market crack that was partially offset by widening wcs crude differentials in the west coast the decrease was driven by turnaround activity at the san francisco refinery slide 11 covers market capture the 3 2 1 market crack for the fourth quarter was 12 45 per barrel compared to 14 60 per barrel in the third quarter our realized margin was 9 50 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 76 market capture in the previous quarter was 77 market capture was impacted by the configuration of our refineries we make less gasoline and more distillate than premise in the 3 2 1 market crack during the quarter the distillate crack increased approximately 1 per barrel and the gasoline crack declined by almost 4 per barrel losses from secondary products of 2 35 per barrel increased 1 28 per barrel from the previous quarter due to premium coke impacts partially offset by increased butane blending into gasoline our feedstock advantage of 1 02 per barrel was improved by 0 99 per barrel from the prior quarter as we benefited from widening wcs and gulf coast crude differentials the other category mainly includes costs associated with rins outgoing freight product differentials and inventory impacts the other category reduced realized margins by 0 54 per barrel moving to marketing and specialties on slide 12 adjusted fourth quarter pre tax income was 287 million 211 million lower than the third quarter marketing and other decreased 203 million from lower margins driven by less favorable market conditions and seasonality as well as higher costs associated with a one time true up to a branded marketing agreement the marketing results included a 62 million benefit from 2019 biodiesel blender tax credits specialties decreased 8 million due to lower finished lubricant margins we reimaged 532 domestic branded sites during the fourth quarter bringing the total to approximately 4 200 since the start of the program in our international marketing business we reimaged 82 european sites since the start of the program in early 2019 refined product exports in the fourth quarter were 157 000 barrels per day compared with 220 000 barrels per day in the third quarter on slide 13 the corporate and other segment had adjusted pre tax costs of 211 million an increase of 33 million from the prior quarter the increase is primarily due to higher environmental net interest and employee related expenses this concludes my review of the financial and operating results next i ll cover a few outlook items for the first quarter and the full year in chemicals we expect the first quarter global o p utilization rate to be in the mid 90s in refining we expect the first quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be about 90 and pre tax turnaround expenses to be between 280 and 330 million we anticipate first quarter corporate and other costs to come in between 200 million and 220 million pre tax for 2020 we plan full year turnaround expenses to be between 630 and 680 million pre tax we expect corporate and other costs to be in the range of 800 million to 850 million pre tax for the year we anticipate full year d a of about 1 4 billion and finally we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the low 20 range with that we ll now open the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session phil gresh with jpmorgan phil gresh jpmorgan analyst yeah good morning greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer hi phil phil gresh jpmorgan analyst hi good morning can you hear me greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer yes phil gresh jpmorgan analyst okay so first question just looking at the quarter here i mean i think several of your peers particularly in refining put up stronger results relative to expectations and this is obviously a tougher quarter for you guys so i was hoping it might be possible you could disaggregate that for us or help us understand what you think the differences there were obviously the turnarounds were called out as a factor but i m also looking at secondary products here as a pretty big headwind in the atlantic basin so i m wondering if needle coke was the factor there as well so just if you could help us think through some of the moving pieces thanks jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah so i think as you look at the quarter the turnaround activity was heavily focused in october and october was actually one of the better margin environments that we had last year and so our turnarounds were focused in that period margin softened substantially kind of in the back half in november and in december the turnaround expense 232 million was more than our guidance and up substantially from the 120 million in the third quarter i think as you look at our premium coke products there are two primary markets there the steel industry and ev sales for batteries both were weak with weaker gdp and manufacturing activity impacting steel as well as lower sales volume or disappointing sales volumes in evs both china and india had declining sales in 2019 relative to 2018 as you know we ve extended our coke product line to serve the battery market which is has a substantially faster growth profile and the car manufacturers are investing significantly to increase manufacturing capability so we expect that growth to return and balance that market phil gresh jpmorgan analyst okay thanks the second question would just be on the chemical side of things obviously it seems like everybody has been getting a lot of questions here on the fundamental picture so greg would love to get your latest thoughts about how you re viewing this cycle and the pace of potential recovery and as you look ahead at the investment opportunities that you outlined in your prepared remarks does the cycle situation right now concern you at all with respect to those possible investments moving forward thank you greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer so hey phil i think first of all we re constructive chemicals in medium long term there is no question in that margins today are cyclical trough at least they feel like it any way at this point in time yeah i think there s a couple of tailwinds we saw some economic slowdown globally as we came in in the back half of 19 certainly the tariffs have had some depressing effect on global margins whether it s 0 05 or 0 10 or somewhere in between but certainly it has had an impact it s quite a bit of capacity coming on in 19 and also in 20 and 21 so i suspect that there is going to be some headwinds on margins as we move into 20 and 21 just from the new capacity coming on globally i think about how cpchem has positioned i like their hand and how they re going to play their hand first of all assets in the middle east and in the us gulf coast are going to be an advantage from a feedstock location and today an lpg cracker on the gulf coast is probably 400 to 500 a ton advantage over a naphtha cracker in asia or in europe so i think that s good and then as we look and kind of dissect the product portfolio cpchem s exposure is really on the high density polyethylene side and so that s not going to be quite as impacted as some of the other ethylene derivatives as we look out in 2021 now in terms of the fids for the new projects these are five year projects to build we can t call the cycle that that closely we probably don t hit an fid until late 2020 or early 21 on the first project so we ve got some time certainly to look at it but i would say today that we would be on track to improve those projects and move forward with those projects just given what we see around the supply and demand balances for high density polyethylene where cpchem sits in kind of that ranking of assets kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer phil i would say when we look at the ihs full chain margin it averaged 0 165 in the fourth quarter december was down slightly below per pound and we ve seen that rally back year to date about 0 165 back flat with the fourth quarter average operator doug terreson from evercore isi please go ahead your line is open doug terreson evercore isi analyst good morning everybody jeff dietert vice president investor relations hi doug doug terreson evercore isi analyst so greg over the past several years phillips 66 has consistently posted better results than peers and especially better than the super majors and especially in the downstream and it seems like advantedge66 is going to sustain that performance over the medium term so my question regards this outlook and specifically whether you feel that there are advantages that you have or disadvantages that you don t have that help explain performance and also how the advantedge66 plan is progressing and then second what role does stronger corporate governance play into it in your view meaning since you re one of only a few energy companies at benchmarks performance against diversified peers which is obviously a higher bar for return on capital than other energy companies and reasons that disciplined capital management would be pretty high emphasis so i ve got two questions one insight into competitive advantages progress on advantedge66 and also the role that corporate governance plays into capital management at phillips 66 greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer okay well thanks for the question doug so working backwards may be i think strong governance starts with a strong board of directors and we have a strong board of directors they re fully engaged in strategy discussions we don t have a board of directors meeting at phillips 66 where we don t talk about the strategy of the company we don t talk about the capital allocation so those are two topics we cover every board meeting i think that as we think about our methodology and our criteria and the 60 40 60 reinvested back in our company 40 return back to shareholders and some flexibility around that given where we the opportunities that are in front of us to invest and where shares are trading but over a long period of time that s where we want to be i mean that is all contingent upon having opportunities and invest in that exceed our hurdle rates and if you look at kind of 2017 18 19 so last three year period our return on capital employed is 13 our nearest refining peers are kind of high single digits and by the way that s an after tax return on capital employed so we re always interested in returns and if we can t find good return projects we re simply not going to invest and then you think about in 2019 returning 3 2 billion back to our shareholders through a strong secured growing dividend and buying our shares when they trade below intrinsic value that s just fundamental to our capital allocation strategy and so you ll see us continue to do that to your first question around the portfolio what differentiates us i think there s a couple of things one we do have a strong diversified portfolio we ve got a good portfolio of refining assets we ve built a strong midstream business 2 3 billion 2 4 billion of ebitda in our midstream business now really if you go back to 2012 excluding dcp we were kind of about 450 million of ebitda in our midstream business so we ve built a significantly stronger midstream business at phillips 66 we ve got a great marketing specialties business then you add on top of that the chemicals business so i like the diversification that we have across the portfolio it creates investable opportunities for us it s a portfolio that generate strong returns and i would say that phillips 66 is a great operator we re consistently one of the safest operators in the industry we re generally at or better than the industry average on operating rates and so we operate really well and this organization has demonstrated the ability to execute well on these capital projects we went back to our board and looked at all of our investments from 2012 to 2019 and we re right on the money in terms of what we said we re going to put the assets on the ground for and importantly we re right on the money in terms of what we promised to deliver in terms of the earnings from those assets which is in my 40 years in the business that s probably as good as it gets doug doug terreson evercore isi analyst yeah and then also greg it seems like the advantedge66 plan will help you guys sustain this performance over the medium term is there anything to report there on that project greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer i think consistent with what we said at our investor day we still see that there is 1 2 billion of opportunity for us we hope to drive 60 70 of that to the bottom line in terms of seeing that in ebitda so you ll see that in terms of margin capture you ll see that in terms of cost reduction you ll see that in terms of capital avoidance but also cost avoidance across the enterprise but more importantly from that changing the way of working for our people at the end of the day it s going to be a much better place to work we re going to have better tools to make better decisions we ll work smarter we ll be more agile we ll be more efficient and i think that will differentiate from our peers now everyone is going to move this way doug at some point in time you either go digital or you die in this business but i think we re out at least i think in the lead position here operator neil mehta from goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open neil mehta goldman sachs analyst yeah thanks very much guys so first question is on the crude side and get wanted to get your perspective on how you think about western canadian crude discounts but also some of the barrels that you import from opec or from alaska that are more medium and heavy in nature western canadian differentials are wide right now we re trying to get a sense of that sustainability of that from your perspective and with those medium and sours we re just trying to think about how the upcoming opec meeting could influence the outcomes there kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah i think that s a good question with the some of the production in canada returning from curtailment with the special production allowance rail waivers we ve seen more production coming into the market in canada there s another 150 000 barrels a day or so of new production schedule to start up in 2020 so there s more supply coming in into the market that is supported wider differentials here in the first quarter as you know we have about a 30 day lag on delivery there so the wide discounts in december will really show up in 1q we expect wcs discounts to follow the normal seasonal pattern with wider winter differentials and then they get tighter in the summer as the production companies perform maintenance i think as we look with the new imo environment in the wider high sulfur fuel oil discounts we re expecting to see not only your historical transportation differentials but probably some increased penalty for sulfur content and so we re expecting that to occur on the gulf coast we ve moved away from a lot of imports from many of the opec countries we ve reduced exposure there as you know we don t pull anything in from venezuela and so i think there is less exposure there from a direct perspective but indirectly with more opec barrels eventually coming into the market those will be heavy sour barrels which should widen the heavy sour discount i think also as you look into 2020 there s more canadian heavy barrels coming in the market saudi kuwait are bringing up production in the neutral zone which is heavy sour production we ve got some incremental gulf of mexico barrels which are medium and sour and new production in norway is 28 api and 0 8 sulfur so lower quality than a normal north sea barrel neil mehta goldman sachs analyst thanks kevin just sticking with the macro and we ve got the bull and the bear on imo on the call in jeff versus greg but i just wanted to get both of your perspectives on how that dynamic is changing recognizing there is a lot of there are a lot of other variables that are affecting particularly the distillate side of the equation but love a refresh on the views there jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah i ll start and greg can clarify what i miss i think in isolation imo is a positive factor for complex refineries like ours obviously there are a number of other considerations high sulfur fuel oil has widened to about a 20 discount relative to brent the 10 year average is 12 a barrel so imo has caused some wider discounts there it was 30 a barrel in december so it s come in a little bit but if you look at the 2020 forward curve as of last year it was trading 20 to 25 under brent so we re kind of at the low end of that range to the industry s credit the transition to the low sulfur marine fuel market has gone very smoothly very few compatibility issues or fonar fuel non available reports i think there will be strong enforcement very low sulfur fuel oil has been rapidly adopt adopted with its high energy contact viscosity and lubricating qualities very low sulfur fuel oil is actually trading wider than ulsd in some markets i think the disappointment has been on the diesel side and diesel has been weak following manufacturing activity that s been disappointing recently mild winter weather i think as we look at demand the first quarter is typically the weakest quarter of the year and gasoline diesel demand decline over 1 million barrels a day from 4q to 1q marine fuel if you look at some of the major ports singapore in the us houston la long beach they all have seasonal trends where the first quarter is the lowest demand quarter for marine transportation so as that demand picks up we could see some improvement and then finally i think with the weakness in gasoline cracks that s pulling low sulfur vgo out of the fcc s and into the marine fuel market as we move into the summer grade gasoline season that s not likely to be the case so that probably cleaned up the gasoline market faster than otherwise would have been the case in the spring and provide some incremental diesel demand for the marine fuel market in the summer greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer good job jeff operator roger read from wells fargo please go ahead your line is open roger read wells fargo analyst hey thanks good morning maybe just to come back to something that was talked about a little in the fall and probably becomes a bigger issue this spring and ties into that whole description of the gasoline market but on tier 3 is there anything that you ve seen where that s affecting the market or do you have any particular thoughts as we switch from winter grade to summer grade and butane comes out whether or not we ll see any impacts from tier 3 jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah i think it s a good point we re very well positioned for tier 3 the vast majority of our tier spending has already occurred and so we re in good shape there we produce much higher premium gasoline as a percent of total than the industry average we haven t seen octane strengthening yet but i think like you we re looking to the shift in rvp and summer grade and taking cheap butane is a good blend stock for the winter grade we are seeing acolyte prices strengthened in anticipation of the summer as you know we recently completed our lake charles isom unit which will provide high octane material high octane blend stocks as well so i think we re looking to the summer to see evidence of the importance of tier 3 roger read wells fargo analyst okay great thanks and changing gears completely there midstream side of the business greg i was wondering it seems like things have gotten tougher in the outlook for a lot of other companies in the midstream is there anything as you look at it where it might make more sense to be acquisitive rather than build or do you need to see valuations and poroject i shouldn t say project but specific facilities come on the market would have to discount quite a bit from current levels to fit within your return criteria greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer yeah there s nothing today that would we d be interested in just simply from a return criteria part roger i think that but the nice thing that we re really well positioned certainly for 20 and 21 we ve got a great portfolio of projects that we re executing post 21 we ll see and if we can find investable opportunities we ll invest we don t we won t so i we re not concerned at this point in time in terms of the opportunities that we have before us we ll continue to watch what goes on in that space but there is really nothing out there today that we would be interested in doing in the midstream space operator paul cheng from scotiabank please go ahead your line is open paul cheng scotiabank analyst hey guys good morning jeff dietert vice president investor relations hey paul paul cheng scotiabank analyst may we have seen a slowdown in the export to mexico and latam greg wondering that based on your market intelligence that has that slow down is driven by the core demand over there is slowing down or that is i mean every year that we have to fall in houston so yeah we have fall but it doesn t seems like year over year that that should be a incremental factors so i m trying to understand that what is the dynamic we are seeing jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah i think paul with regard to mexico you remember a few quarters back there were pipelines that were shut down as people were stealing product off the pipelines and i m not sure we fully recovered all the demand there i think that may have suppressed some demand in mexico we are seeing that as a continued good market for product exports i think if you look at our exports in the fourth quarter they were down a little bit and that was really driven by some of our export refineries being in maintenance and in some cases finding higher priced domestic markets than what was available in the export market but we expect to see continue to see some growth in the latin american market from an export perspective paul cheng scotiabank analyst and jeff i think you guys receiving about 300 000 barrel per day of wcs net to you i think another 100 000 maybe going to the jv partner with the increase in the wcs production is there any opportunity for you guys to receive more or that is something that you guys are working on jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah we are constantly assessing the availability of transportation out of canada and our ability to access more barrels there attractively priced both from a mid continent and the gulf coast perspective and so we re constantly assessing those opportunities in our commercial people take advantage of the opportunities when they present themselves but as far as long term commitments for rail or something like that we don t see that at this point operator prashant rao from citigroup please go ahead your line is open prashant rao citigroup analyst thank you for taking the question thank you good morning thanks for taking the question my first one is on renewables and biofuels i was wondering greg if you could talk a bit more about the decision to cancel the ferndale project apart from the permitting and regulatory hurdles i mean what you said in the prepared remarks were there any constraints on feedstock sourcing or developing that network and then maybe taking a bigger picture view on the other projects in the portfolio of san francisco humber and the offtake in marketing in nevada could you help us to understand how these differ from ferndale not only in terms of the regulatory and permitting but maybe also in terms of the feedstock resources greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer i so first of all it wasn t a feedstock sourcing concern that we had at ferndale it was strictly around the ability to permit the project there and so we withdrew when you think about what we re doing in humber what we re doing in san francisco these are existing assets that we re either repurposing or utilizing differently and those are certainly very easy to do easy to feedstock source and we ll continue to look for other opportunities in our portfolio the deal with ryze is essentially we re responsible for securing the feedstock and then we have an offtake agreement there so think of it like a tolling arrangement and we have no concerns there so as we thought about how we re going to approach the renewable strategy for us we want to use existing assets where we could do that we want to partner with people that had existing technology and capabilities and then look at grassroots investments again in a partnership which is where the ferndale one really felt that that would have been circa 800 million to a 1 billion investment in cooperation with reg so we ll see i think that we certainly have other places that we could build a grassroots facility and you should expect that our strategy really hasn t changed it may not be at the ferndale location prashant rao citigroup analyst okay thank you that s helpful and then my second question so on esg the discussion seems to be progressing pretty quickly overseas and focus on decarbonization is really stronger than it was even a year ago and it seems discussion here in the states maybe following a similar path but perhaps at a delay so what s going on overseas p66 has been a leader in positive esg momentum within the us hydrocarbon space so i just want to get your thoughts on looking ahead if there is a greater focus on decarbonization among investors what are some of the strategies to balance this with and still maintaining p66 s strong return on capital and you re low cost of capital across the portfolio and particularly if you think about growth capex decisions both of what s currently in the portfolio and maybe overall the longer term opportunities there greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer yeah well i think maybe you want to start with i think the us is a world leader in technology and innovation our economies the envy of the rest of the world we re a world leader in energy production we re world leader in emissions reductions including greenhouse gas emissions and so i think that there is a path forward that would say we can develop our energy resources responsibly sustainably we can have a strong growing economy and we can have a better environment so they are not mutually exclusive at all in our way of thinking as we think about the opportunity set in front of us we re investing in next generation technologies for lower carbon economy so things like our opv and organic photovoltaics our solid oxide fuel cells you ve seen us introduced two groups one for heavy duty trucks one for light duty vehicles that increased the mileage by 4 5 as a direct reduction in greenhouse gas emissions so i think that you ll see phillips 66 and many companies frankly approach this problem from many different angles specifically around low carbon investments i think it s a good thing i think we should encourage our companies to invest in low carbon technologies and we should send them to do that but as we look out two and three decades we still see that fossil fuels are going to be a majority part of the energy mix just because you re not going to be able to get there from here with the current technologies that we see operator doug leggate from bank of america please go ahead your line is open doug leggate bank of america analyst hi good morning everybody greg i wonder if i could take you back to midstream again and you did a pretty thorough job of walking us through the assets that you have coming online and you re working interest and so i m just curious about what is the thinking in terms of the timing if and when those may be dropped the mlp or do you have different funds for those versus your historical pattern greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer well i may be we start from the point that i mean all those midstream assets are qualifying income and they could certainly they could certainly go through the mlp we ve resisted and will continue to resist specific information about timing of drops when those drops could occur i think we ve spoken publicly about our interest in growing our midstream business at psxp it s an efficient way for us to do that giving more psxp trades and the yields that it generates and then you think about the uplift in some of the parts we re still incentive to grow psxp as fast as we can and so our view is that you grow it efficiently but it s going to pay its own way too equity markets are closed in our view beyond some dribs and drabs around the atm program but generally great balance sheet at psxp executing 800 million plus capital program this year at psxp so at some point in the future you should expect these assets should logically end up at psxp and but the timing we just don t go through that doug doug leggate bank of america analyst okay just a reminder can you tell me what the ebitda is associated with those assets held at your c corp level kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer we ve got a 800 million to 900 million of ebitda at still at psx and growing is of course is we re bringing on these new projects too doug leggate bank of america analyst that thus the qualifying income right kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer that s right doug leggate bank of america analyst okay thanks my follow up is just very quickly on turnarounds obviously you re turnaround expense is up a bit this year just as for phillips specifically but also for the industry i think jeff touched on this a little bit but do you anticipate that we re going to see that contributing to clean up of the overhang we ve seen for gasoline in particular right now and just specific to phillips is there anything unusual this year or is this normal course of business jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah i think that s a good question doug i think there was a lot of speculation that given the high turnaround activity in 2019 that there was a lot of activity that had been moved forward out of 20 into 2019 and a lot of the tunraround activity is on a pretty strict schedule for replacement and so we are seeing 2020 turnaround activity being relatively high for the industry as well you look at the gulf coast pad 3 looks to be a very active turnaround season this spring with a lot of fcc an alkylation units being included in that planned work so i think we re continuing to see turnaround activity in 2020 as well i think that s one of the factors that could help clean up the gasoline market operator paul sankey from mizuho please go ahead your line is open paul sankey mizuho analyst hi everyone sorry for the sort of detailed question but as regards the situation in china i was wondering in reference to your contracts and how it takes time for these things to feed through when do you think you ll be able to say with some degree of certainty what s actually happening to markets over there thanks jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah it s a good question paul i think it s still early i mean we are seeing i think some impact on diesel demand diesel cracks jet jet cracks i think we are starting to see some impact on freight rates it s really early it s a little bit speculative to say that but i think we are getting some indication of impact already it s really hard to measure and i think it s going to be difficult to determine the depth and the duration of this event so i think there s still a huge amount of uncertainty out there as you well know there is about 300 000 barrels a day of impact from sars and in fact you ve included it in one of your reports china s economy is much bigger today than it was at that time but i think paul we re still dealing with a lot of uncertainty as to the impact on the coronavirus greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer paul i was just going to say petrochemical same thing right i think we re concerned we ll continue to watch petrochemicals right now pricing is kind of moving up a little bit in asia when you look at petrochemical inventories there at five year lows so and so we ll just we ll just have to see and watch this but i agree with jeff it s just almost too early to make a call on this but it s certainly as our attention and we re watching it closely paul sankey mizuho analyst yeah understood i mean obviously this thing really only took off in the past week i just wondered how long you thought it would be before you could actually say we now know that this has happened given the time it takes for all this stuff to move around the world greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer yeah jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah it s certainly impacting commodity markets the volumes we ll have to keep an eye on paul sankey mizuho analyst yeah i was thinking more obviously in terms of real volumes if i could switch you had a tough october many ways because it was a good environment and you had downtime give a sense for what your cost opportunity was or opportunity cost was there and could you just go over again the outlook for this year in terms of your turnaround i know you ve addressed it somewhat but it s interesting to think how skewed this quarter might have been if it hadn t been for the october turnaround thanks jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah it s a good point we don t typically comment on lpos but i think if you assume most of the downtime occurred in april and adjust and kind of model october versus november versus december and i think it would get you close we have provided guidance on turnaround activity first quarter we do have some turnaround activity planned as well and we ve got the full year guidance there also so i might just lean to that guidance operator manav gupta from credit suisse please go ahead your line is open manav gupta credit suisse analylst hi jeff can you clarify where you are with the permitting process of both the red oak and liberty and liberty specifically because there were some news items out there and i was hoping you could set the record straight over there jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah we are moving forward we re getting some feedback there is that i ll go ahead here we re moving forward we ve ordered the pipe for liberty and taken delivery of pipe the permitting process is moving forward as expected so we re very much moving forward as anticipated there it s a first half 2021 in service date and all systems are go on both liberty as well as red oak manav gupta credit suisse analylst a quick follow up on the marketing and specialties side we saw a slight jump in the capex between 3q and 4q about 264 million i m assuming this is associated with the jv payment of the west coast thing and but the press release is saying you re going to acquire 100 more stores in 1q or in this in the 2020 so i m trying to understand would there be a second payment associated with this 100 stores or all the payment has already been made here kevin j mitchell executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah manav it s kevin so yeah you re right that the variance in capex for that segment is all attributable to the formation of that joint venture so 260 million went in which is almost the full variance quarter over quarter the additional acquisition that was referred to in the press release does have some additional spend in whenever that timing whenever that acquisition closes there will be some additional spend on that it s not of the same magnitude as the initial upfront jv formation though so you ll see that coming through whenever that closes operator matthew blair from tudor pickering holt please go ahead your line is open matthew blair tudor pickering holt analyst hey good morning everyone given the discounted high sulfur fuel oil prices in the fourth quarter were you able to increase your runs of hsfo as you feedstock your refineries and if so can you provide any sort of numbers on the incremental volumes or ebitda uplift and i guess if not was the constraint economic or more just like equipment related jeff dietert vice president investor relations yeah it s a good question matthew i would highlight one of the things we talked about at the investor day with some refining projects that allow us to upgrade over 30 000 barrels a day a high sulfur fuel oil to very low sulfur sub 0 5 blend stock and we accomplished that late last year and think there is actually some upside to those volumes so we are moving some very low sulfur product into the market we are finding opportunities to take advantage of dislocations associated with imo i think not only on the high sulfur fuel oil side but we ve been able to increase the sales of low sulfur production into the market to capture some of the premiums on low sulfur material we ve also been able to bring high sulfur material in as a feedstock for our processing units as you know we have substantial coking and treating capacity to upgrade heavy sour streams i think you might look in our supplemental information we provide both our crude throughput as well as our total process volumes and the difference there would probably give you a good indication on intermediate feedstocks and a lot of those being heavy sour product matthew blair tudor pickering holt analyst great thanks for the color and then on the chem side greg i was hoping you could share some insights on just the asia pe markets we ve seen margins dip negative or a little bit now haven t really seen shutdowns are those coming in your opinion or i guess through other regions need to cut back first greg c garland chairman and chief executive officer i think our view is that probably asia and europe are probably under the most pressure today and you would expect there could be some cuts there also you re starting to see some price movement in asia though so that s i think that s a sign that people need to do something about the margin environment they find themselves in and then i would just say tariffs are still kind of an overhang particularly to china and so we ll see where all that plays out but yeah i think it s pretty tough margin environment out there right now operator thank you we have now reached the time limit available for questions i will now turn the call back over to jeff jeff dietert vice president investor relations thank you very much for your interest in phillips 66 if you have any follow up questions please contact brent or me thank you operator duration 60 minutes call

on wednesday the argentine chamber of deputies the lower house of congress voted 214 2 to allow the entry of foreign troops and the participation of argentine troops in exercises abroad several of the military exercises listed in the bill are being organized and financed by the pentagon most prominently it includes three unitas exercises organized by the us southern command southcom and the brazilian regime of the fascistic former captain president jair bolsonaro and the gringo gaucho exercise which involves receiving a us aircraft carrier with thousands of troops and sailors the bill was introduced by the previous right wing government of mauricio macri which left office last december however the unanimous support by the peronist ruling coalition frente de todos of president alberto fernández and vice president cristina fernández de kirchner provides undeniable evidence of the subordination by all factions of the argentinian ruling class to us imperialism serving as a left front for the ruling coalition all of the peronist trade union leaders voted in favor including hugo yasky facundo moyano vanesa siley and walter correa the affirmative list also includes the frente patria grande a party created by juan grabois a popular economy leader also serving this role within the ruling coalition juan carlos alderete and verónica caliva of the maoist revolutionary communist party pcr voted yes to welcoming us troops the vote is far from an isolated case while alderete and caliva were absent for a second vote the same day their supposedly left allies who frequently denounced the macri administration for selling out the fatherland voted in favor of a bill declaring the sustainability of the foreign debt of the government a priority and allowing for unrestricted debt emissions this constitutes a transparent backing to continuing the enrichment of wall street vultures through ruthless social austerity moreover these forces have remained silent in the face of other alignments of fernández s foreign policy with us imperialism last week the president s first official trip was to israel during the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp an obvious gesture to the trump administration buenos aires also extended the designation and financial sanctions against the terrorist organization hezbollah a ruling party in lebanon and close ally of the iranian government foreign minister felipe solá also threatened the nicolás maduro government in venezuela with international isolation after the blocking of juan guaidó a us sponsored puppet openly seeking a military coup against maduro from entering the national assembly some commentators have pointed to argentina s granting asylum to evo morales who was overthrown in a us backed military coup last november as an exception to the pro us line however morales and his movement toward socialism mas have played an essential role in suppressing opposition to and legitimizing the coup and the elections being organized by the far right regime installed by washington and its bolivian military allies morales himself acknowledged that washington offered to airlift him out of bolivia after the coup the only two legislators who voted against the two bills on wednesday belong to the left workers front unity fit u however this posturing is as hypocritical and frail as that of the left peronists their front includes forces like izquierda socialista which backed the us imperialist interventions in syria and libya while the fit u s international partners in the new anti capitalist party have expressed support for a us war against iran similarly to its role in chaining workers to the peronist trade unions the fit u s anti imperialism is aimed at keeping workers from making the necessary political break from all nationalist and pro capitalist forces recent peronist governments were able to posture as independent of us imperialism thanks to the boom in commodities prices fueled by greater chinese investment and trade the argentine ruling class used this leverage against us and european capital to achieve greater participation in the profits reaped from the exploitation of argentine workers while affording limited increases in social spending this was reflected politically in the so called pink tide governments across latin america the fall of oil mineral and other commodity prices in 2014 however ended these special circumstances leading the argentine bourgeoisie and the upper middle class which became very wealthy during this period to shift to the right and increasingly orient back to us imperialism trade with china quintupled between 2000 and 2007 fueled by the sale of soybeans and copper exports china replaced the united states as argentina s main trade partner after brazil since 2016 however the united states again became the second main buyer of argentine exports in terms of credit argentina received 10 major loans from china amounting to 19 billion between 2005 and 2015 according to the inter american dialogue at below market interest rates and mainly for infrastructure projects macri sought to cut back the scale of these projects seeking to reassure us investors but amid a deepening economic crisis his administration s credit line with china grew to 18 7 billion even as it received the largest imf loan in history of 57 billion last year china approved another 7 9 billion to the macri government for building a nuclear plant the us southern command built a military base in neuquén a project approved since 2012 and temporarily halted in 2018 due to local protests the southern province of neuquén has the vast vaca muerta oil and gas deposits being exploited in a partnership between the argentine state and major us corporations like exxonmobil chevron and other firms the 1976 1983 military dictatorship backed by the united states until washington aided the uk in its imperialist war to retake the malvinas islands in 1982 resulted in mass popular opposition to the military forcing the successor governments to implement defense national security and intelligence acts limiting military involvement in internal affairs ever since and especially after the social upheavals during the 2001 2002 economic crisis in argentina the united states has sought to gradually erode these changes under the administrations of the late néstor kirchner 2003 2007 and his wife cristina fernández de kirchner 2007 2015 gringo gaucho military exercises with us aircraft carriers took place in 2004 2008 and 2010 preserving this route around argentina is crucial for us carriers since they are too large to cross the panama canal in february 2011 a us military cargo plane was retained temporarily by argentina presumably for administrative reasons however it was exploited by the kirchnerists to varnish the government s anti imperialist image the plane and materiel were soon returned and kirchner expressed her approval for future gringo gaucho operations but no other joint exercises were carried out during her term nonetheless fernández de kirchner continued to increase military collaboration agreeing to a new us built military base in the chaco region signing into law anti terrorist legislation demanded by washington and hosting a special us military training program for ministry of defense officials a scathing report by investigative journalist horacio verbitsky found that the e imet program employed in the training aimed at bringing down the barriers that often exist between the armed forces civil officials and legislators recognizing that military operations could be seen as a return to the bad old times the official document cynically claims to oppose the military usurping power during macri s term argentina vowed to carry out more anti drug and anti terrorist operations with us agencies and allowed the pentagon to build another base near the country s strategic northern border with paraguay and brazil and another at the southernmost city of ushuaia when us forces arrived in may 2018 for a military exercise peronist legislators protested that congress had not been consulted a fraudulent ploy exposed by the recent vote at the same time a space station built by china in neuquén and used in the lunar landing in january 2019 has been denounced by the us southern command head maj gen craig s faller who told the us congress last year that it could be used to monitor and aim at us allied or partner targets in space activities preceding this increased collaboration the obama administration agreed to declassify tens of thousands of documents revealing us training at its school of the americas and the arming of death squads under the argentine military dictatorship that kidnapped tortured and murdered tens of thousands of radicalized workers and youth the argentine officials then became key advisers in setting up death squads that served the us backed regimes in central america until the 1990s

quarter outlook following that i ll finish by discussing our priorities and initiatives for 2020 and the current trends we re seeing across our end markets let me start by giving you some takeaways for the fourth quarter from a financial perspective total sales in the quarter were 440 million we generated 53 million of operating income with earnings per share of 0 95 these results reflect the persistent market softness we ve been experiencing over the past few quarters with the most notable impact coming in our metalcasting european refractories and north america paper pcc businesses throughout the quarter we continued to totally control costs drive productivity improvements and implement pricing actions while operating in this challenging market environment we drove growth across several of our product lines our pet care business continued its momentum as we grew our private label portfolio leverage the strength of sivomatic in europe and saw strong sales of our new fragrance boosters higher activity in the construction market as well as the deployment of newer water proofing solutions supported sales in building materials robust customer demand for our latest rheology modifying sealant products led to a strong quarter for specialty pcc it was also a solid quarter for our ground calcium carbonate business we delivered overall growth in asia driven by sales increases in china india and indonesia volumes of our greensand bond products in china increased 19 as we continue to demonstrate the significant value that our engineered products offer to our customers and paper pcc volumes in asia grew 6 over last year led by our new satellite in indonesia 14 volume increase in china our service businesses has performed well energy services had a solid quarter and continued its positive trajectory with higher well testing activity in the gulf of mexico and increased deepwater activity in international offshore basins refractory sales were down sequentially due to continued weakness in europe and several furnace relines in north america however laser equipment sales were very strong in the fourth quarter and segment margins were over 14 cash flows remained robust through the fourth quarter capping off a strong cash flow year for us operating cash flow for the quarter was up 14 compared to last year and free cash flow was up 30 all in all we continued to implement operational measures to manage through the market weakness we ve been experiencing while also maintaining growth momentum across many of our product lines before matt takes you through our fourth quarter financial performance i would like to give you my perspective on 2019 what i was most encouraged by was our team s solid operational and strategic execution against the backdrop of changing conditions in several key end markets and geographies our team s resiliency execution focus and agility were on full display throughout the year our performance reflected our continuous improvement mindset and focus on aggressive cost control as we implemented decisive measures to adjust our operations to align with changing market demand and doing all of this we advanced several strategic initiatives that support our long term growth let me summarize the progress we ve made advancing those initiatives we re focused on growing in more consumer oriented markets through our household personal care and specialty business these are attractive markets with stable long term growth potential and we have unique capability and resources to serve them this product line was up 8 for the year driven by the strength of our global pet care business as well as increased sales from our broad portfolio of high margin specialty applications such as bleaching earth for edible oil clarification and products for the personal care and animal health markets our strategy to shift the environmental products business from base geosynthetic clay liners to a higher value portfolio of specialized technologies gained significant traction with sales up 8 and margins that more than doubled over last year sales of these specialty products grew by more than 40 and we have a robust pipeline of additional opportunities to secure this year we are well positioned to support more complex landfill remediation and water treatment issues and also address these large market opportunities globally we are the world leader in greensand bond systems for the global foundry market and there are significant opportunities to leverage our deep technical expertise and demonstrate our value proposition with customers in large foundry markets such as china and india this year we extended our penetration into the china foundry market as volumes of our tailored blended products increased 7 despite the soft foundry market conditions we experienced we are also the world s largest producer of precipitated calcium carbonate with the most advanced technology portfolio our technologies help customers increase based filler levels in paper address environmental and recycling needs and provide solutions for their premium packaging applications in addition we also offer high performing pcc rheology additives for the automotive and construction sealants our strategy is to expand our pcc volumes globally through each of these initiatives and we made considerable progress in 2019 our 125 000 ton satellite in indonesia came online in the first quarter and helped drive paper pcc sales growth of 7 in asia we also secured the permits for our next satellite in china which will be our largest pcc plant globally when fully operational and in india where our volumes were up 10 in 2019 we signed two new satellite contracts and started the construction on another expansion on the technology front we deployed a new variation of fulfill called fulfill plus which is the most cost effective technology to increase filler levels in paper we also expanded our applications into the packaging market with a contract in europe as well as through the deployment of envirofil a technology which addresses the sustainability challenge of paper recycling last we introduced several new specialty pcc products to the market and supported that demand through capacity expansions innovation and new product development is a core strategy for our company and we made noticable progress strengthening our pipeline this past year specifically we commercialized 55 products and our revenue derived from new products was up 10 over last year we leveraged our operational excellence tools with our r d capabilities to develop higher value products on a faster timeline this year i ve highlighted many of our other new technologies such as fluoro sorb newyield resistex and additrol low emission technologies formulations all of which reflect our enhanced focus on developing products that address broader environmental and recycling issues for both mti and our customers these new products which give us a more comprehensive and differentiated solutions offering are central for supporting our growth strategy into new markets and geographies from an operational standpoint we overcame several obstacles this past year as market conditions noticeably softened in may and june we took decisive actions to align our cost structure with the new demand environment throughout the year we also continued to drive pricing actions to offset the inflationary cost pressures that we ve been facing the engagement of our employees around our culture of continuous improvement enables us to navigate through these types of conditions while also remaining focused on advancing our growth initiatives we conducted 10 800 problem solving kaizen events and received more than 65 000 suggestions from our employees throughout the year put this in context each day on average nearly 30 kaizen events are being held across the company and we re receiving 178 suggestions from our employees on how to do things better this is a tremendous level of involvement in the operations of our company from all 3 630 mti employees demonstrating the power of our culture throughout the year we remain focused on cash flow generation and strengthening our balance sheet we generated 173 million in free cash flow which was 36 higher than last year we use this to pay down 92 million in debt and returned 48 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends lastly sustainability has always been a core value of our company in 2019 we took steps to further advance our sustainability initiatives by establishing environmental reduction targets in six areas which are outlined in our most recent sustainability report these new commitments bring more focus and clarity to the environmental aspects of our sustainability efforts and are fully aligned with our overall corporate strategy and financial goals overall 2019 was a productive year for mti though we faced some distinct market and operating challenges i m proud of what our team accomplished during the year the momentum we generated and growth initiatives that we executed on in 2019 provide a solid foundation for sales and earnings growth in 2020 i ll give you more on my perspectives on the year ahead at the end of the call but let me turn it over to matt who will take you through our fourth quarter results and first quarter outlook matt matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer thanks doug and hello everyone i ll review our fourth quarter results and full year results the performance of our four segments and also provide you with our outlook for the first quarter i ll then turn the call back over to doug for some additional perspective on the year ahead fourth quarter sales were largely as expected with market trends consistent with the third quarter apart from our typically lower seasonal volumes bridge on the left shows the sales change by major driver foreign exchange impacted sales by 3 2 million or 1 percentage point we drove price increases of 5 6 million in the quarter however these increases were partially offset by 4 5 million of lower market based pricing for specialty sands the biggest driver of change in overall sales versus last year was unfavorable volume and mix primarily due to the continued market weakness in metalcasting and european refractories as well as the shutdown of two paper machines in north america the operating income bridge shows that the volume mix and higher raw material costs had the largest impact our pricing actions continued generating 1 1 million in the quarter we also had one time items resulting in an unfavorable comparison to the prior year including corporate mark to market adjustments and a higher provision for bad debt we generated 2 6 million of savings from our restructuring program in the quarter and we are on pace to meet our 12 million annualized savings target operating margin was impacted by volume and mix but the largest impact this quarter came from the unfavorable one time cost comparisons earnings per share excluding special items was 0 95 and our effective tax rate was 17 6 for the quarter now let s review the full year results sales for the full year 1 8 billion was similar to 2018 however there were a number of factors that affected our sales the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange was largely offset by four months of incremental sales from sivomatic which we acquired in may of 2018 we experienced market driven decreases in metalcasting european refractories talc and north american pcc which were partially offset by growth in household and personal care environmental products and energy services as well as pricing gains across many of our businesses in terms of operating income lower volume and product mix had an impact of 17 5 million mostly driven by the sales decrease in our metalcasting business pricing actions totaled 23 1 million for the year and largely offset the raw materials and other input cost increases we experienced operating margin was 13 1 of sales with the lower market driven volume and product mix having the largest impact year on year and 2019 earnings per share excluding special items was 4 23 now let s review the segments in more detail starting with performance materials performance materials sales were 3 lower than the prior year primarily driven by metalcasting which saw continued weak demand in the foundry market and lower volumes and pricing in specialty sands as doug noted metalcasting penetration in china continued with greensand bond sales growing 14 in the country household and personal care and specialty sales increased 4 driven by higher pet care and specialty products building materials sales increased 12 on stable north american construction activity environmental products sales were 9 lower than the prior year due to the timing of projects as doug mentioned full year environmental products sales grew 8 as we continue to drive this product line toward a more profitable mix including our higher value resistex products and water remediation solutions segment operating income was 23 2 million the change from the prior year was largely driven by the lower metalcasting volume and higher raw material costs now looking to the first quarter we see similar market conditions to the fourth quarter in the majority of our product lines we see continued growth in our consumer oriented and specialty businesses in building materials and environmental products we should experience a typical seasonal uptick in march and overall for this segment we expect operating income to be similar to the fourth quarter now let s move to specialty minerals sales for this segment were relatively flat versus the prior year growth in paper pcc in asia driven by the ramp up of the new satellite and capacity additions was offset by lower sales in north america due to paper machine shutdowns specialty pcc products increased 2 due to higher volumes from our demand driven expansions and sales of processed minerals were flat overall as higher gcc offset lower talc cells segment operating income was 19 4 million the year over year change was primarily due to the paper machine shutdowns in north america lower paper pcc volumes in europe and lower talc sales into automotive applications we are focused on growth initiatives in pcc to offset market declines in north american paper as doug highlighted we are in the process of constructing approximately 250 000 tons of additional capacity in asia and europe and we are also expanding capability in specialty pcc now looking to the first quarter we expect the market conditions that we experienced in the fourth quarter to continue for pcc and a typical seasonal uptick in march for processed minerals and overall for this segment we expect operating income to be similar to the fourth quarter now let s turn to refractories refractories segment sales decreased 6 primarily due to the continued soft steel market conditions in europe we also experienced lower us volumes as a result of several furnace relines in the fourth quarter of 2019 these lines had a temporary impact on customer demand for our products as newly relined furnaces require a less monolithic refractory for a period of time laser equipment sales were a highlight of the quarter with december installations the highest on record now looking to the first quarter we expect lower refractory volumes due to the furnace relines as well as unplanned furnace outages at two us integrated mills we also expect fewer laser equipment sales coming off the very strong fourth quarter overall for the refractory segment we expect operating income to be lower by 1 million sequentially now let s look at energy services energy services had a solid quarter with sales up 16 and operating income up 9 sales growth was driven by a higher well testing activity in the gulf of mexico as well as increased demand for our services internationally in addition we are seeing strong pull through from our orca technology offering in the brazil and asia pacific deepwater markets we have a strong pipeline of process equipment sales and we see well testing activity remaining stable overall for the segment we expect operating income similar to the fourth quarter moving to our cash flow and liquidity in the quarter we generated 80 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter bringing the full year total to 238 million and full year free cash flow of 173 million which was up 36 from 2018 and in the fourth quarter we used our free cash flow to make 23 million of debt payments we purchased 20 million of shares under our 75 million share repurchase program our total liquidity is strong with cash and equivalents of 243 million at the end of the fourth quarter and 200 million available on our revolving credit facility our net leverage ratio stands at 2 1 times ebitda and we will continue our balanced approach to capital deployment in 2020 now let me summarize what we are seeing for the first quarter overall we expect generally similar market conditions for the fourth quarter in all segments we see continued growth in our consumer oriented specialty product lines in addition our pipelines and environmental products and energy services are strong however in the first quarter we expect north american refractories volumes to be impacted by furnace relines finally we are closely monitoring the developing situation in china given the events happening in the country we could experience extended downtime which would impact volumes in metalcasting and paper pcc in sum we expect first quarter eps to be between 0 90 and 0 95 per share and now i ll turn it back over to doug to share our perspectives and key priorities for 2020 douglas t dietrich chief executive officer thanks matt before beginning the q a portion of the call let me provide some high level themes in the year ahead and our operational and strategic priorities first off our team is energized aligned behind our culture and objectives and prepared to execute on the attractive opportunities in front of us as well as navigate potential obstacles as we start the year conditions in our key end markets are similar to what we experienced in the second half of 2019 one difference however is our customers have largely adjusted their inventories to these lower demand levels we expect these market conditions to remain through the first quarter and our visibility to any improvement beyond that is a bit limited right now against this backdrop we are well positioned to benefit as these market strengthened positive momentum that we ve generated last year across several of our product lines and geographies will continue and we have a number of projects ramping up throughout the year the combination of which were the foundation for sales and profit growth in 2020 we ll be bringing online more than 250 000 tons of additional pcc capacity in asia and europe driving volume growth later this year and into 2021 in specialty pcc we anticipate another solid year supported by our capacity expansion our metalcasting business will continue to penetrate large global foundry markets with our engineered greensand bond formulations build on the momentum we generated last year in household and personal care specialty and environmental products businesses in energy services we expect another solid year with a strong pipeline of offshore well testing and filtration projects new product development continues to be a priority for us in this year we will further accelerate our product development processes and introduce an increased number of tailored products that address our customer needs we ll also be focused on margin improvement through pricing actions across our product portfolio savings in our supply chain as we ve seen inflationary pressures begin to taper as well as cost control and productivity improvements in addition the cost reduction initiatives we implemented in 2019 will help drive margin growth this year our strong balance sheet with our debt levels debt at target levels gives us the flexibility to deploy capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and also toward acquisitions where we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities that align with our strategic growth initiatives to sum up the year ahead we see a positive 2020 with some uncertainty in the first half of the year giving way to a stronger second half as the growth projects we have in hand take hold ok before turning it to questions given the rapidly changing health situation in china i thought i d take a moment to address how this pertains to mti first and foremost our focus is on the safety and well being of our 500 employees there but we re also maintaining close communication with our customers and suppliers we have 15 locations in the country none of which are in the wuhan province we re closely monitoring this fluid situation and i m in daily contact with our leadership team there with that let s open up the call to questions questions and answers operator and we ll take our first question from dan moore with cjs securities brendan cjs securities analyst good afternoon guys this is brendan on for dan so i want to ask if you go back to what you mentioned at the end with the coronavirus i know it s probably changing by the day but i guess what would you say or maybe i guess potential first second derivatives kind of impacts on the business and you may have mentioned this i maybe didn t catch it but is it does that impact your eps guidance for 1q or are you still unsure of what how it s going to affect you just because it s obviously again changing by the day douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes thanks brendan it is a fluid situation we re certainly on top of it we are contacting daily with our employees there at the moment all of our employees are safe and healthy but we continue to monitor that constantly right now we have 15 locations there right now our say one or seven pcc plants are all operational except for one which will probably be down until about the 10th of february our other five locations primarily metalcasting locations will likely be down until february 10 again we re continuing to monitor both our supply chains and customer activity to make sure that we re in supportive of all of that with where our employees were located many of our facilities are located in areas that are currently affected but that obviously could change and we re monitoring that i guess from your guidance situation your guidance question our guidance in the first quarter we always build in some additional outages that typically happened in some of our customer base normal years around the chinese holiday new year so we did that in that guidance what it doesn t include is any significant extension in what s going on and that we just can t measure that at the moment but we do have some built in there for some extended outages but if it continues on for a longer period of time that s certainly going to affect eps brendan cjs securities analyst great thanks and then another question just with changing gears in capital allocation nearing that two times leverage you said you re more comfortable and obviously you did some buyback this year i guess what you re thinking for 2020 i believe you had a common balanced approach so opportunistic m a and some buybacks is that how you re thinking matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer yes we currently have a 75 million one year program authorized by the board and we ll be executing on that i guess the way we look at it is now that our debt levels are kind of to our targeted levels we look at steering that toward shared purchases with preference but also we continue to look at acquisitions and as they have been slow we might pull back on that those repurchases in share to what we feel are attractive strategic growth acquisitions so i think it s both we ll see how the year plays out on both fronts but right now the priority is executing on that 75 million program brendan cjs securities analyst right douglas t dietrich chief executive officer and through the end of the fourth quarter we had already purchased 20 million under that program brendan cjs securities analyst okay great thank you guys appreciate it matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer brendan let me just go back there there might be another question just to frame up china our sales on a given quarter in china around 35 million the margins are a little bit lower than there on average for the company its because of some of the new developments and start up costs that we have there but that gives you an idea of like a full quarter kind of impact so it has an impact but it s not overall it s about 8 of the sales of the company it s not overall significant to the overall operations in the annual quarter for the company brendan cjs securities analyst okay great i got that thanks operator we ll now take our next question from silke kueck with jpmorgan silke kueck jpmorgan analyst good morning thanks for all the detail on being able to like update the effects of the virus i appreciate that in your guidance what are the price expectations that you have for the first quarter and also for the full year in terms of selling prices douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes silke as we look at the first quarter guidance what you have seen is a very similar market condition moving from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and so the overall volume level and the mix that we have will be fairly consistent from a pricing perspective i think you ve seen us over the course of the last 10 quarters 12 quarters continue to drive pricing against inflationary factors but also to get the value of our products that exist through the value contribution we provide to our customers that s going to continue so you will see us on pace with what we ve experienced over the past couple of quarters in terms of overall pricing deltas on a year over year basis silke kueck jpmorgan analyst okay that s helpful and i was also wondering that you can talk about what was behind the strong growth in the building products division in the fourth quarter which you said was up 12 was that unusual business plan was like the pricing dynamic and how that business fared so far through the month of january jonathan j hastings group president performance materials yes silke this is jon good morning thanks for the question building products like you saw we had a good quarter a lot of that is timing of projects as you know this business is highly dependent on construction markets worldwide we d have a fairly robust portfolio we re introducing new technologies so those certainly are go in our favor as our customers recognize the value proposition that we have and looking forward we re pretty well positioned with our products our sales team our production capability worldwide which has we ve restructured over the course of the past year and a half but the fundamental reason that customers typically buy from us is the technical support that we provide them as well so looking forward we re well positioned to take advantage of the construction markets the portfolio ebbs and flows based on timing and affordability to spend by the building owners or the municipalities that are just another building douglas t dietrich chief executive officer that helps silke silke kueck jpmorgan analyst yes that s helpful thank you for that and if i can ask the last question on metalcasting business did you have a how to view as to whether the automotive markets for the year will be better or flat or lower like i realize the first quarter it was particularly difficult but do you have do you have a concept for what you expect for the year or do you think things will improve or you think they ll be more flattish for the year matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer right now i ve got a couple of different statistics that i ve been looking at we re trying to marry that with it s not just automotive i think automotive is probably about 40 kind of the end market exposure for our foundry customers and that includes north america and china and india heavy truck other agricultural off highway is the other big sectors right now it looks as though the automotive market is going to be down a little bit but i think we re feeling from our customers right now it seems flat and right now we re not seeing anything changed from an upward trajectory or downward through the first quarter it seems to feel a lot like it was in the end of the third quarter fourth quarter and into this first quarter so largely right now it s flat i can t we re in constant contact with our customers it doesn t seem that they re giving us much information on what they see past march it s too hard in terms of the uncertainty out there heavy truck lower than last year that s going to have a smaller impact on the metalcasting volumes so i guess what i d characterize it for the first quarter it s going to be about the same and right now we re looking at relatively a flat market the differences i mentioned in my comments is that what we experienced last through the third and fourth quarter was a lot of destocking we saw that across some of our markets we have seen that many of our customers have adjusted those inventories and so i think that compounding effect is largely over so i think should there be a catalyst that changes things in somewhat positive direction will benefit from that pretty quickly silke kueck jpmorgan analyst thanks so much good luck to q1 matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer thanks operator we ll now take our next question from rosemarie morbelli with g research rosemarie morbelli g research analyst good morning everyone douglas t dietrich chief executive officer good morning rosemarie morbelli g research analyst could you touch on new products you mentioned that new products for the year revenues increased 10 can you talk about the size on which that 10 apply and then can you talk about it in terms of regional success douglas t dietrich chief executive officer sure so our new products let me try and see if i can characterize it for you so the way we talk about growth in new products is anything that we ve kind of commercialized over the past five years we generate revenue from those products those are continued new and ramping up and revenue from those new products has grown 10 over last year so we re seeing some increased traction from those new products they are across our businesses i would say given the size of our performance materials business the majority of them of the majority but more than half of them are in that business there s a lot of innovation going on across the broad product portfolio in our personal care business in metalcasting jon mentioned our building products with new waterproofing products and of course our environmental so with our new remediation and specialty products so they are a broad range and they apply globally in pcc we mentioned our new technologies kind of environmental addressing environmental issues and high filler technologies for paper customers so the majority i think of the new product revenue growth is in paper is in the performance materials business i don t want to leave out refractories we ve got a number of new hybrid technologies that s moving us deeper into the eaf market as production shifts away from over time away from bofs and that s been a big driver so it s really across the company and it is globally we generated about over 100 million from new products this year i tell you a lot of that goes to replacing ourselves so it s probably 50 50 in terms of what s really new growth new avenues and then 50 is upgrading our products for our customer need and replacing an older product to keep things our value proposition fresh so hopefully that characterizes a bit of the new product development we see that growing next year rosemarie morbelli g research analyst that is very helpful thanks and that brings me to my next question you said that more than half of the new products was generated in performance materials performance material is the only one of your segments with a margin lower than what i was expecting as opposed to all of the other businesses which seem to have done better than my expectations which was based on your guidance at the end of the third quarter so can you give us a feel for why you did better in some than you anticipated and then working performance material while you have a lot of new products which i would guess have a higher margin douglas t dietrich chief executive officer they do i guess so the way i ll answer the question is performance materials was when matt showed you the impact on our mix the majority of that mix change was shifted into in performance materials so i would say that the decline in metalcasting globally which has been one of our larger segments and also it has a nice profit margin to it it wasn t fully offset by the environmental products and the other product lines in that segment which right now as you ve mentioned are lower margin right now but we ve been moving them up through that specialty so as those margins expand in those other products that will aid the margin recovery in that segment but the biggest issue in terms of margin in that product line or that segment has been the mix shift from metalcasting to these newer and developing growth segments growth products so the other business is more stable in terms of their mix impacted in paper in terms of volumes this quarter but their mix which means their margins have been much more stable as we ve seen rosemarie morbelli g research analyst okay and you if i just an easy question interest expense was about 9 9 million in the fourth quarter substantially lower as you have paid down debt is this a good number to use for the next four quarters matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer yes so rosemarie two factors in the interest expense that you remember we have a component that s floating right there that s probably about 40 of our overall debt and the rest is fixed and so as interest rates have come down in that market you ve seen our rate move a bit lower but then we ve also been paying down so assuming that that rate stays fairly flat that approximately 10 million is a good estimate to use going forward rosemarie morbelli g research analyst okay and then actually you mentioned in your prepared remarks some bad debt can you touch on that what is the dollar amount and given the environment out there are you expecting a lot more going forward matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer no to the last part of that question on expecting more bad debt going forward this was a singular customer issue where we essentially resolved an ongoing dispute with the customer especially in minerals and so the overall impact of that if you look at the bridge i provided on operating income it was in other bar that was about 6 6 million about half of that is related to the mark to market that sits in corporate and the other half was the provision for bad debt rosemarie morbelli g research analyst okay thank you operator our next question will come from david silver with cl king david silver cl king analyst okay hi thank you so i had a few questions i think the first question i was hoping to get a little clarity on with the related to your pcc business and i personally i kind of consider 2020 a major kind of transition year for that foundational business of yours you have a number of satellite plants queued to start up and i m also kind of wondering if there are any further shutdowns that are that have been announced but maybe not executed so would i be correct if i was to do a waterfall or a cascade or whatever that may be this business will finally turn clearly positive year over year in the second half of this year is that your expectation what are the kind of the moving parts that we should keep in mind as 2020 progresses thank you matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer so thanks david so let me start off i highlighted in my comments what we re building this year and so yes most of that will come on in the second half and i do think that turning point is next year it s in the second half of this year we also have a number of other projects and new technologies that are also again packaging our new filler technologies but not just the base filler that we re building and so we have a number of different fronts that we re working on growth executing on last year but regarding the timing in that waterfall that you mentioned let me turn it over to dj and he will give you more specifics on when these are coming online d j monagle group president specialty minerals and refractories yes thanks for the question there s a couple of dimensions i want to put on it let s first just make sure you re clear on what s coming because you ve asked about other announcements or things and last year international paper had announced that they ll be taking down the machine in the riverdale mill which is in north america the net effect of that is some 50 000 tons that will be lost in that location now they are putting in a packaging line and we are going to be participating in that conversion to the packaging so they ll be making white top liner so it s 50 000 tons that are coming out and then sometime replacing that will be probably will probably get 40 to 50 of that pack and it ll be much more we believe sustainable revenue stream at that location so that s part of our shift to new technologies there the other volume that is coming online doug had mentioned that we started a expansion in india that expansion plus a new satellite will be coming online at the end of the first quarter and that s about 40 000 tons to 45 000 tons in the second quarter we ll be starting up the another opportunity in india which is some 50 000 tons so recognizing the profit impact in that probably in the third quarter we announced a packaging satellite in europe the satellite won t be finished that expansion won t be finished until 2021 but we ve been able to do some deep bottleneck on that and we ll start seeing increased volumes come online for that in the fourth quarter as well so the long winded way of saying that in that second half especially toward the end of that half is substantial volume coming on there s a very big piece of volume that is coming on with within china with chenming is the name of the customer that s 150 000 metric tons that we d expect to start bringing online late in the third quarter early in the fourth but that ll be a slow ramp up given the magnitude of the opportunity on top of that we ve discussed a pretty robust pipeline in the past and let me just affirm that that continues to move along pretty well in the past i expressed some 20 opportunities that still exists 20 opportunities and it s across three sort of technology lanes traditional pcc that goes into printing and writing grades especially in asia and some packaging grades that are in the more developed regions on top of that we ve got doug was highlighting environmental products we ve got some further pursuits and pretty advanced discussions on environmental products products that we call envirofil and newyield and then we ve got some new things that we re trialing out in packaging as well so that s the paper component and then we re very excited about the expansions that are coming online for specialty pcc as well which should show up in that segment as a good element to growth in 2020 as well so david let me just kind of summarize that what we re bringing on in the first half of this year largely fill the hole that was created last year from shutdowns in the second half of this year there s another 200 000 tons coming online that will ramp up through the second half and into 2021 that s going to be the growth in addition to that dj mentioned the number of different technologies that we ve with envirofil that s all incremental smaller volumes but also incremental to that whole story that help david silver cl king analyst yes thank you very much that is great great color and i thanks in particular mentioning the transition at cip mill wasn t aware of that i wanted to maybe circle around to the m a question maybe from a different angle so i think in the refractories area one of your major global competitors announced an acquisition of a us competitor i think yesterday or the day before and to my eyes it was discussed in kind of strategic terms on what they would how they would leverage that investment so just in general i mean were you aware of were you bidding on that or was the refractory area is something of interest to you and how do you think that the entry of a very large global competitor with a strategic focus on that area might help the competitive balance in the us market thank you matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer sure so let me say yes aware of it and of the company i m going to let brett argirakis who runs our refractories business talk more about how that fits or doesn t really fit with what we do but we were aware of it we understand the competitor but i think that s geared toward a different strategy than the ones we are in terms of furnace relines and maintenance brett give a little color on what you know brett argirakis vice president and managing director minteq international inc and mti global supply chain sure sure thanks david yes as doug said we were aware of the acquisition the buying company is already positioned it s a global company and they re well positioned the purchased company is a smaller midwest based company and they serves some of the markets that we do exactly serve the markets they re a bit smaller they re not currently a major competitor of ours their focus is more on the alumina based products castables rammables motors and shades and that s a very small part of our business in some cases it s not even any part of our business at all but our focus is more on the magnesia based refractories a basic refractories as we call them and we focus more on the furnace repairs in the bigger mills in both electric furnaces and integrated so again maybe a good fit for the buying company but yes it s something that isn t a big impact to our business douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes so something we are aware of david but not something that necessarily fits our strategy and where we are in these mills and bof and the hf furnace did that help david david silver cl king analyst i would say thank you for that let me just ask is there time for one or two more or should i get back in the queue douglas t dietrich chief executive officer sure ask another question go ahead david silver cl king analyst okay great so i have one for matt and it would kind of be a variation on the question that what i asked earlier but when you do look at the interest rate structure here i mean this is i don t know to me i never expected to see rates quite this low again so i understand if you just maintain the current capital structure we can kind of pass out the trend in interest expense and it will go down a little bit but from your perspective are there any opportunities here in other words would you refinance either to the meaningfully lower your overall interest average interest rate or maybe change the term structure of what you have out there does the current interest rate environment present an unusually good or a structural opportunity for you matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer so we are benefiting like we said we have a good position in floating rate that s allowed us to take that actual rate difference down as markets have moved down i think as we look longer term for us we have two real big components in our debt structure we have a note that is due in 2021 and then one that s due in 2024 and we ve been paying down the 2021 position it s currently sitting at a position of about 100 million to 200 million and so the way that we ve looked at it in the year ahead and in the cash flow generation that we re expecting for 2020 again we re expecting that 150 million level in play with the capex between 70 million and 80 million that gives us that flexibility and that s why doug and i talk about the balanced approach to our capital deployment yes you re seeing share repurchases go up as we near the two times target level on net leverage but also maintaining flexibility in that capital structure and giving some additional cash flow to debt paid down and taking care of that 2021 will be an opportunity for us looking longer term the maturities themselves don t present a significant risk to us but as you said with which where they are presents an opportunity potentially to term out at a relatively attractive grade and maybe get some of that fixed and so we re looking at all of those options but given the cash flow we have the flexibility we have with that cash flow and the terms that we have in our two major tranches right now there s not a significant amount of urgency and let me just also add given our average rate of debt is about 4 that s very attractive as well david silver cl king analyst okay and if i could just squeeze in one last one this would be maybe more of a philosophical question for doug but you ve been in charge for a number of years and over that time by the way my question is about organic growth but over that time you ve done a tremendous amount of work internally and put out an array of new products and have repositioned your assets geographically significantly but the top line still is hovering around that 1 8 billion area and it remains a tricky macro environment from your position do you think that your company is now positioned to kind of drive top line growth organic growth going forward on an annual basis even if the macro environment in particular autos and steel and paper the macro demand levels don t change so much in other words how much of a cyclical recovery is required for your top line to start to show meaningful growth relative to internally developed new products and applications thank you douglas t dietrich chief executive officer well let me start by saying because as an industrial minerals company we re going to supply a variety of industrial minerals segment or industrial segments that have some cyclicality to them so we are going to see the ups and downs of the automotive and construction and that s going to be a piece of our company and still it s been a i guess what i can tell you is what i ve been working on and what this team has been working on is to start to put ourselves in positions as you had said to develop products to put ourselves in geographies that avail ourselves to much more sustainable and long term growth so pools of opportunity that we have the capability to serve and also that have less cyclical or non cyclical but also more steady growth rates and that s why i talk about today areas big pools of opportunities for things that we do like metal casting but in big pools in china and india basically applying what we do and same with pcc applying what we do more quickly but applying what we do today in north america to other areas but there are things like and i talk a lot about household and personal care and specialty these are products that address more consumer related markets we call them and they are also a larger pools of opportunity for us where we have unique capabilities and vertically integrated supply but they also have more steady growth rates associated with them so there is more work to do no doubt in terms of making sure that our technologies are not just fillers and paper but they apply to a broader range of packaging and environmental issues that these paper makers face moving ourselves into markets such as environmental consumer product oriented markets that are mineral based but that have more stable growth rates and larger opportunities but then also focusing on doing what we do really well around the world in our large positions like metalcasting and applying them to other big pools of profit so yes i think there s more to do but that is the strategy that we ve been under in terms of moving ourselves that way you re going to see over time as you saw this past year that cycle in our mature businesses take away but i will tell you that what we ve delivered in this past year on these new products and what we ll continue to deliver we feel going into 2020 is probably 50 million to 60 million as kind of base run rate growth just from what we have in hand so the satellites we have in hand the new technologies and our run rate that we ve developed over the past few years and the products i mentioned is a 2 to 3 growth rate next year if nothing else happens should markets recover and we come out of that cycle that come out so i ve always stated that this business on a i know it s never natural but on a regular run rate should grow at about five mid single digits percent and as we continue with our operational excellence initiatives and drive margin improvement i think that creates pretty healthy story for earnings growth over the long over the next several quarters that helped david david silver cl king analyst yes no that was a great color i appreciate that thanks very much operator we ll now take our next question is a follow up from silke kueck with jpmorgan silke kueck jpmorgan analyst douglas t dietrich chief executive officer hi silke it s hard to hear you silke kueck jpmorgan analyst is this better sorry about that douglas t dietrich chief executive officer yes silke kueck jpmorgan analyst okay sorry about that in terms of your restructuring savings my memory is that you said you would be at 12 million run rate in the first quarter and so maybe your actual restructuring savings were i don t know 4 million to 5 million in 19 and maybe that is a 12 million in 2020 do you think the majority of that will flow down to the bottom line or what are the offsets to that and i was also wondering whether you can just remind me that where you think the savings might show up in the segment basis douglas t dietrich chief executive officer sorry can you just repeat the last part of that question silke silke kueck jpmorgan analyst i was just wondering whether you could remind me which segment should benefit most from the restructure douglas t dietrich chief executive officer got it absolutely so i think your math is right actually when you look at it you re seeing in the 2019 timeframe capture of about 5 million to 6 million which means incrementally you re going to benefit from the restructuring savings about that amount in 2020 when you look at what it has been some of the offsets though in terms of the overall bridge process in this quarter you saw some of those one time items right which was a relatively big impact so as we look forward not looking to really have a determination on whether we have those one time items or not again because they re really driven by some outside factors but if those don t recur that that should be dropping to the bottom line and the biggest piece of where you are seeing the savings come from is in the performance materials business but really it s been across the portfolio where we ve been taking opportunities to gain efficiencies and to pull some savings out and i think we ve told you a large portion of that has been on the people side so if you look at 2020 we ll be impacting the bottom line offset here in the fourth quarter by some of those one timers and should be coming across the portfolio as we move forward matthew e garth senior vice president finance and treasury and chief financial officer yes silke we re constant we re looking very hard as i mentioned in my comments on cost control given the market environments we have all of our employees are focused on continuous improvements productivity improvements discretionary spending in this kind of environment we re very focused on costs you will see incremental 5 million to 7 million of that restructuring coming through on a year over year basis in 2020 and we re going to continue to look at ways to save money as we continue through this kind of market environment so that s part of our dna and we re going to continue with that in 2020 douglas t dietrich chief executive officer by the way silke sorry i think part of your question was not only what segment but where is it right and i think we ve told you previously that a big piece of this was taken in the cost of goods sold so in the operations in plant administration so not necessarily in sg a silke kueck jpmorgan analyst thanks very much operator at this time i d like to turn the call back to ms buckwalter for any closing

a year or so though its track record isn t perfect concerns over the potential impact the virus could have on the global economy intensified friday after the u s state department warned against travel to china and some u s carriers responded by suspending flights the move by u s airlines helped deepen a slide in oil prices u s crude fell nearly 6 in january a decline that coincides with a sell off on energy stocks the sector is down 11 2 for the year the biggest decliner in the s p 500 industrial stocks which include airlines and other transportation companies also ended the month in the red

high frequency algorithms blamed for flash crashes bangkok specially designed labels on an empty stand for facemasks read china fight and wuhan fight in a store in bangkok yesterday the world health organization declared a global emergency over the new coronavirus as china reported the death toll had climbed to 259 with nearly 10 000 infections afp london widely blamed for volatile flash crashes in currencies and equities high frequency algorithms may also be why shock global events including the current coronavirus seem to have lost their power to spook markets for any length of time whether stocks bonds currencies or commodities asset prices seem less prone to any selloff for very long the us killing of an iranian general and iran s retaliatory missile attack are among potential catastrophes that triggered violent but surprisingly shortlived reactions just since the start of 2020 in both cases knee jerk yen buying and selling of equities faded within hours allowing stocks to scale new record peaks now even as china s coronavirus threatens to throttle economic growth global stocks are not far off all time highs certainly many factors are shaping the resilience not least central bank money printing and rising global savings which boosted the value of world stocks by 25 trillion in the past decade yet it is hard not to link the shift in reaction by financial markets to the rise of automated trading strategies in the past six years the share of algo trading in the 6 6 trillion a day fx market has more than doubled to 27 among fund managers a survey by greenwich associates found there is some reason to believe algos cause volatility especially when trading thins and the humans overseeing them vanish for instance during public holidays that s what likely happened during the wall street flash crash of 2010 and dramatic but fleeting yen moves in jan 2019 but they also offer the advantage of being able to transact at lightening speed at any hour of the day or night with razor sharp accuracy and lower overall costs being machines they are also alien to the common human impulses of fear and greed that tend to take over algorithmic trading is dispassionate said scott wacker global head of fixed income currency and commodity e sales at jpmorgan one bank at the forefront of the algo revolution as a result the reaction function in currency markets to even major geopolitical news has considerably shortened which enables stability to return more quickly in short when left field events hit not only can algos scan and react swiftly to newsfeed many now can gauge the potential asset price impact the most sophisticated can be trained to learn from the experience before the next shock one currency trader familiar with algo use said a machine reading coronavirus cases would typically buy stocks if informed of 500 new cases 10 deaths if it s 3000 new cases 200 deaths they might sell the point being that as soon as a headline is out the machine led market is trading on it the trader said speaking on condition of anonymity but the machines had vol triggers he said meaning they can stop trading when the market moves beyond specified limits how it works simple first and second generation programs merely broke down large buy sell orders into chunks to minimize market impact now algos can be hooked up to sophisticated language processing technology to read and analyse news feeds then react accordingly all in the space of seconds said antony foster head of g10 fx trading at nomura however this can lead to overreaction in the first instance foster warned the impact in fast moving markets can be outsized if the models rapidly push prices towards existing buy sell order levels trip them and trigger other orders that s what happened when news broke of iran s jan 8 attack according to a quant fund manager who said algos had bought yen with the aim of triggering larger buy orders once a key option barrier was tripped a plausible comparison may be the 0 6 plunge in the s p 500 within the space of half an hour on jan 29 the move came after american airlines and lufthansa said they were suspending their china flights but an hour later the losses had been recouped stephane malrait ing bank s head of market structure and innovation says in such instances algos are programmed to check if moves are in line with price trends if the swings are in response to the an incident human traders can step in to smooth out the trade malrait added next the algos may gauge the seriousness of the incident based on patterns of investor behaviour and economic consequences that followed previous such episodes after the iran missile attacks the message from the specialized data crunchers to the algos was stand down one was geoquant a us firm which monitors geopolitical events and models the asset price impact we modeled our iranian geopolitical indicator back to seven years and put the current tensions against that backdrop said geoquant ceo mark rosenberg who concluded the risk would subside with minimal oil price impact another firm predata applied its machine reading algorithm to last september s attacks on saudi oil facilities which had raised fears of a regional war to predict what might happen next the program compares interested parties online attention to a subject with the media coverage it receives predata ceo hazem dawani said the saudi event elicited little reaction from military officials and policymakers the amount of news was far more than the amount of attention being devoted on the particular subject by investors politicians companies directly impacted by them dawani said he concluded rightly that there would be no escalation virus unknowns executives at half a dozen firms providing risk analysis for algo strategies told reuters their services were increasingly in demand but declined to give figures but they acknowledged limitations reactions to the coronavirus for instance could be hobbled because the only meaningful precedent is the 2003 sars epidemic which also coincided with the us invasion of iraq second the pathogen and its dangers are relatively unknown rosenberg said geoquant s china health risk index was at record highs that has pushed up the firm s social instability risk index for china pressuring chinese markets however he said this correlation breaks down beyond short periods the longer term relationship between chinese health risk and equities chinese or global is basically zero he said reuters
the express tribune opinion by inam ul haque published january 30 2020 it was the 2018 election and we did what we had never done before vote many like us had come in droves to vote for tabdeeli change from poor to good governance from corruption to honesty from loot and plunder to a system that is transparent and corruption free from the law at discretion to a rule based system from under the sway of elite the ashhrafiyya to a greater sensitivity for the have nots and from privilege to the lack of privilege but sadly more than seventeen months down the highway of hope the direction of tabdeeli seems less clear the charismatic kaptaan less convincing the dream of a vibrant pakistan waning and hope turning into hopelessness with internal fissures becoming noisier and national challenges unresolved the perception is getting traction far and wide in cities and in villages among old and young and among the haves and have nots that pti is also more of the same this column was avoided for long but being a bystander is not an option raising the right noise with required decibels is a civic responsibility and that civic responsibility needs to be performed who voted for tabdeeli the middle class the upper middle class the salaried cadre the womenfolk the have nots the hopefuls and those who wanted to try a third option away from the tainted pml n and ppp who supported tabdeeli since most of the above cadre is well represented in the establishment there was finger pointing in that direction hence the title of a selected pm what was the perception of tabdeeli the common man just wanted life to be easier with food on his table and his country ruled by incorruptible leaders who could make a difference the urbanite middle class voted for dignity transparency and a rule based system with clear national direction intelligent consensus and none of the dirt and filth attached to the erstwhile governments this educated cadre rightly did not expect quick results and ill thought fixes but they expected borrowing from the military phraseology a political grand strategy nobody expected fumbling u turns lack of confidence ineptitude knee jerk reactions and utter lack of sensitivity to the problems of the poor it was not to be more of the same the politics of agitation under the pti that climaxed with the 2014 islamabad dharna continues to this day if the party spends half as much time improving its governance delivery and performance as it spends defending itself in tv talk shows and on social media things will be different if energies spent by imran khan pursuing the crusade of getting corrupt to the gallows and then compromising by releasing those very accused are spent in improving pti s subpar performance the country will be in a different mood if some of the wise honest but unflatteringly upright counsel that is available to any leader in this country unless he or she sees him herself as aql e kul epitome of ultimate wisdom had been heeded to in picking the right man for the right job rather than petty likes and dislikes and preference for jiyala style faithfulness the much trumpeted tabdeeli would have been visible yes people were patient they wanted to give the inexperienced cabal the opportunity and time to steer the country in right direction but time is limited and patience runs thin if tabdeeli was discernible people even the less privileged were willing to endure hardships for some time but when direction is not clear and there is no hope of such clarity with the government devoting more time and all energies towards political point scoring and making noises louder than the opposition the result is a sad loss of honest narrative both among the rulers and the ruled a colleague recently interacted with university students and came out worried the youth he said see no future and no hope leaders inspire and instill hope rather than deflecting blame all the time if and when they are unable to inspire hope dies and the society is adrift and that is the beginning of a catastrophic unraveling much has been said about the poor state of the economy and its handlers who are reportedly more interested in returning the installments of loans with interest to the lending organisations rather than any social consequences it does not take an einstein to see the pitfalls of this approach the world bank was not dupe to appoint a political economist of the calibre of late dr mahbubul haque to study and advise the bank on social ramifications of their loaning policies the callousness of the imf programme and the total surrender of government s economic team to some does smack of an ulterior motive that may not be the case but in crises perceptions matter more than realities every now and then stories are churned out by the government media and financial teams about improvements in this or that economic indicators with no visible improvement on the ground what the street sees is runaway inflation soaring prices of food in all categories and continuous increase in the rates of fuel and utilities with no end in sight the rupee was depreciated on the advice and urging of these economic wizards by a swooping 30 to 40 per cent in the hope of boosting exports which has not happened even elementary teachers of economics know that pakistan has an import driven economy like korea japan etc who import raw material to export finished goods stagflation partially caused by strangulation of imports cannot be hidden behind the economic jargon of pti s economic experts the once mighty real estate sector is in ruins with no hope of early resurrection the 50 million homes the flagship project of the pti so far remains a pipe dream people are holding on to money as any sizeable potential transaction would invite scrutiny by the fbr in the frenzy to meet economic targets all relevant government departments especially in punjab are resorting to blatant harassment and blackmail sometimes for services they never deliver small businesses are closing with companies laying off and failing all apparently going unnoticed or uncared for by the wizards of the pti yes the mantra of being on one page with the establishment is good to feel good but so was the case with nawaz sharif when he hand picked the then military leadership from down the seniority list it starts like this the popular disaffection gleaned by the military is conveyed to civilian leadership through sincere advices for course correction by the way the military has no clue of the economy when the discontent becomes a noise and the noise a crescendo the die is cast for tabdeeli military support is neither unlimited nor unconditional and almost always sensitive to the deafening crescendo one earnestly hopes the dying pangs don t become the death of a dream that once upon a time not long ago was pti and its kaptaan published in the express tribune january 30th 2020 source share this twitter facebook

morning i will discuss the high level results for the fourth quarter and provide an update on our strategy to grow the bank before turning the call back over to drew to discuss our financial results in more detail to start there are six key highlights of the fourth quarter and the full year of 2019 that i would like to focus on today first i am thrilled with the performance of the entire amalgamated team in achieving the best financial results in a 97 year history of this great institution and propelling the bank past the 5 billion asset mark in 2019 i m also very happy with our quarterly and full year earnings which show the earnings potential of the bank going forward these are historic achievements and have motivated our entire organization to do even more in the coming year second i m thrilled with the success that our team achieved in growing our loan portfolio in 2019 i would note that we made the decision in the fourth quarter to move our pace assets to securities given their structure but no change has been made to the assets that we hold as a result we delivered 7 annual loan growth on top of the addition of 264 million in pace assets taken together our portfolio grew 15 for the full year 2019 which exceeded our expectations especially when you consider the substantial runoff that we achieved in our indirect c i portfolio as we continued to derisk our balance sheet amalgamated s mission and values remain a critical differentiator in the market and have positioned us for growth in the sustainable lending sector which was the key driver to our success in this past year more importantly we are poised for continued growth as we enter 2020 third our deposit franchise has again proved to be a competitive advantage that amalgamated enjoys as we continue to experience healthy growth through the fourth quarter and full year of 2019 this success was broad based having achieved strong political deposit growth and expansion in our core relationships in the nonprofit labor and philanthropic sectors the percentage of noninterest bearing deposits expanded nicely in the quarter and the full year and our cost of fund positioning remains a long term strategic differentiator for us fourth our noninterest expense was slightly elevated in the quarter primarily associated with sox readiness and we started to invest in new business initiatives in the trust department which represent exciting growth opportunities for the bank that we expect to accelerate in 2020 given the opportunity that we see ahead we will discuss these initiatives in more detail in a moment fifth credit remains very stable with the exception of one previously modified indirect c i credit that we moved to nonaccrual over the course of 2019 we reduced the indirect c i portfolio by approximately 177 million and only 60 million remains in the portfolio and lastly we continue to work hard every day to build upon our reputation as america s socially responsible bank and are proud to announce our recent esg accomplishments this quarter including the launch of our cross departmental corporate social responsibility committee with board oversight making additional esg related disclosures and continued support of policy advocacy efforts that help build a more inclusive and sustainable world we believe that our long term positioning as a socially responsible company and a solid esg investment will be especially important in this era where more and more consumers are demanding that the companies they do business with hold themselves accountable to a broad set of stakeholders turning to the quarter we witnessed nice growth in our residential portfolio as well as continued strengthening of our position in the renewable energy and energy efficiency space towards the end of the quarter we added approximately 177 5 million in pace assessments a category that we like for its mission alignment its relatively favorable returns and the credit strength of the assets in the portfolio we have provided more details on these assets on slide 9 of the presentation we also saw additional activity in commercial solar and commercial pace again categories of assets that we like for their returns and safety as well as mission alignment with our overall business positioning as america s most socially responsible bank we are also pleased to announce that post our acquisition of new resource bank we doubled our commitment to impact lending and investing to 700 million this initiative a two year goal was achieved this past december delivering upon our goal eight months ahead of schedule our unique deposit franchise continues to deliver achieving 29 5 annualized growth during the quarter and 13 for the full year or 23 after adjusting for the 327 million of short term deposits at year end 2018 at quarter end our political deposits totaled 578 6 million which is a record high for amalgamated i am particularly encouraged by the strength of our brand and the success that our bankers have achieved over the course of 2019 as we continued to take share in the political deposit market as we greatly expanded our share of both political candidates and major party committees in order to further expand our franchise we hired an experienced political banker in our san francisco office in the fourth quarter who has made very good progress expanding our reach in california where we have an opportunity to grow our presence beyond our political deposit franchise we also experienced broad based deposit growth in our other key verticals we brought in new labor relationships in our western region office and hired a banker this month to focus on our union relationships in the west we also saw a nice increase in our lending to labor unions in our northeast region and opened new relationships with major unions in our mid atlantic region our nonprofit banking team has grown and they had an excellent year in 2019 adding new relationships with environmental organizations lgbtq groups women s organizations and community development groups we hired a lender to focus on building relationships with the cdfi community and toward the end of the year we saw those relationships starting to bear fruit and 2019 was the year we really began to solidify our presence with philanthropies adding robust cash management relationships through innovative lending partnerships and we are well poised to discuss investment management opportunities with their endowment managers in the future looking ahead to 2020 our deposit pipeline is strong and all of our teams in all three regions are off to a strong start as we announced on our last call we plan to open commercial offices later this year in boston and los angeles and i expect to see us adding new relationships in those markets as well our deposit cost of funds held relatively steady at 36 basis points in the fourth quarter down one basis point from the third quarter of 2019 and up 11 basis points from the year ago quarter looking forward we would expect our political deposits to remain relatively stable before declining toward the latter part of the third quarter as campaign funds get spent through the election if the past is prologue and i fully expect it to be the funding cycle seen in previous elections should repeat itself and campaign fundraising will begin again in earnest in the first and second quarters of 2021 our noninterest expense for the quarter was 33 5 million an increase of 1 6 million from the linked quarter primarily as a result of noncore expenses consisting of 1 1 million related to the acceleration of expenses associated with the closing of two branches in new york city in 2020 and the previously mentioned costs related to sox and our trust department work of note our trust study is an example of the investment spending that we are undertaking to expand the growth potential of the bank we believe that we have the opportunity to grow our trust business and have been exploring ways to more effectively deliver the investment management funds that are currently on our platform and to expand our offerings during the quarter we announced our agreement with invesco to become a sub advisor for our investment management business this relationship is based on our mission to expand opportunities for socially responsible investments given invesco s leadership in providing esg and mission focused products we believe our clients will benefit from the breadth and depth of invesco s passive equity fixed income and alternative investment capabilities we are coupling this expanded investment capability with a serious commitment to improving the delivery of our core custody offering i am personally very focused on the transformation of our trust business as i believe the value of our franchise can be greatly enhanced through a vibrant set of investment and custody offerings that can increase the bank s noninterest income something that i think is extremely important in the current and perhaps prolonged low interest environment looking to the year ahead we also see an opportunity to expand our geographic reach as well as our product offerings given the large market opportunity that we see amalgamated continues to be the banking partner of choice for individuals and companies who share our strong values and mission and we continue to estimate that there is a 90 billion commercial deposit opportunity in the united states to tap into this large market and as i referenced earlier we continue to move forward with our strategy to open commercial banking offices in boston and los angeles in 2020 we are currently recruiting bankers and securing commercial office space as we will not be opening branches to support this effort we will also continue to return capital to shareholders and are pleased with our board s approval of a 33 increase in our quarterly dividend to 0 08 per share importantly we will maintain a disciplined capital allocation strategy as we remain focused on maximizing value for our shareholders to conclude we are entering 2020 very well positioned for the future i am pleased with the progress that our team has achieved and the strides we have made to prudently grow our franchise this past year additionally 2019 proved to be a year where our reputation as america s socially responsible bank started to become more widely recognized in the market as we were recognized with several notable awards including euromoney s best bank for corporate social responsibility in north america and forbes best bank in california i m very excited with the year ahead given the many opportunities that i see and i would like to thank all of our employees for their hard work now i d like to turn the call over to drew for a more detailed review of our financial results drew labenne chief financial officer thank you keith i will begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year results before turning the line back to the operator to open for questions turning to slide 6 in the fourth quarter deposits increased 318 6 million or 29 5 annualized to 4 6 billion from the third quarter of 2019 while average deposits for the quarter were 4 4 billion as expected average noninterest bearing deposits increased 87 6 million from the prior quarter primarily due to seasonality related to the election cycle and now represent 46 of average deposits at year end our deposit cost of funds held relatively steady at 36 basis points deposits from politically active customers such as campaigns pacs and state and national party committees increased 67 7 million from 510 9 million at september 30 2019 ending the year at 578 6 million as outlined on slide 7 the election environment continues to be a source of growth for our deposit franchise the focus for the year ahead will be the presidential race and as keith mentioned we haven t continued to be a partner supporting the business needs of the majority of democratic candidates as seen on slide 8 we delivered annual loan growth of 228 1 million or 7 1 as compared to december 31 2018 and ended the year with 3 4 billion of total loans this loan growth was achieved while following through on our diligent efforts to run off our indirect c i portfolio additionally as keith mentioned we increased our balance of pace assessments which are now reported in the held to maturity securities portfolio to 263 8 million which is inclusive of approximately 171 million in purchase residential pace assessments this quarter looking forward we continue to like the yield and credit profile of the pace assets and see this as an important driver to our portfolio growth in 2020 and beyond the yield on average earning assets was 3 81 for the fourth quarter a decrease of 14 basis points as compared to the same period in 2018 driven by lower market rates on loans and securities the yield on our total loans was 4 10 compared to 4 22 in the third quarter of 2019 due to lower market rates on new loan originations and the impact of lower fed funds rate turning to slide 10 our net interest margin was 3 43 for the quarter a decrease of seven basis points from the third quarter and a year over year decrease of 14 basis points the decrease compared to the linked quarter was primarily due to the decrease in yield on interest earning assets fourth quarter nim includes five basis points of accretion of the loan marked from the nrb acquisition net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 42 3 million which compares to 41 8 million in the linked quarter and approximately 2 0 million increase as compared to 40 2 million in the same quarter of 2018 for the year net interest income was 166 7 million which compares to 149 7 million in the year prior now on to noninterest income noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 7 8 million increasing slightly from 7 7 million in the third quarter of 2019 and a 221 000 increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 noninterest income for the full year was 29 2 million an increase of 3 1 compared to 2018 keith has already hit on many of the drivers for our expense increase in the fourth quarter for the full year 2019 our noninterest expense remained relatively flat at 127 8 million a decrease of 177 000 or 0 1 from the 128 million for the year ended december 31 2018 the slight decrease was primarily due to increases in compensation and benefit costs of 2 9 million some of which was for temporary workers for special projects occupancy and depreciation also increased 0 7 million due to scheduled branch closures in 2020 the increases were offset by a decrease of 1 8 million in professional fees associated with the ipo and nrb acquisition in 2018 there was also 1 6 million of decrease in other expenses associated with lower fdic expense and release of off balance sheet provision as we head into 2020 we will continue a moderate level of strategic investment in the trust business and the expansion into boston and los angeles additionally there are always some inflationary pressures on normal expenses these increases will mostly be offset by the savings we have secured in 2019 and the two branch closures in early 2020 we estimate the branch closures will average run rate expense savings of approximately 2 million annually we forecast our core expenses to run at approximately 32 million per quarter in 2020 with some variation in the quarters skipping ahead to slide 14 the credit quality of our portfolio held steady throughout the fourth quarter as nonperforming assets totaled 66 7 million or 1 25 of period end total assets at december 31 2019 compared to 1 42 as of september 30 2019 a decrease of 4 9 million from the linked quarter and an increase of 7 4 million as compared to december 31 2018 criticized and classified loans decreased by approximately 9 million in the fourth quarter compared to the linked quarter the provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled an expense of 83 000 which compares to a recovery of 600 000 in the third quarter of 2019 the provision expense in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by an increase in specific reserves from our indirect c i portfolio due to one loan moving to nonaccrual partially offset by a release in allowance related to the movement of pace assessments to held to maturity securities skipping to slide 16 our gaap and core return on tangible average common equity were 9 7 and 10 7 respectively for the fourth quarter of 2019 the core return compares to 11 4 for the third quarter of 2019 and 9 5 for the comparable period in 2018 the modest decrease in core return on tangible equity in the linked quarter was primarily due to the previously discussed factors lastly we remain well capitalized to support future growth to conclude we are pleased with our 2019 results in terms of growing the business and positioning ourselves for increasing profitability turning to slide 17 we have outlined our expectations for 2020 this guidance assumes a year end 2019 yield curve with no change in the fed funds target for 2020 we are assuming pre tax pre provision earnings of 70 million to 78 million we re targeting 10 balance sheet growth we are targeting a core efficiency ratio of 64 or better thank you again for your time today we look forward to updating everyone on our first quarter results in april with that i d like to ask the operator to open up the line for any questions operator questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from alex twerdahl with piper sandler please proceed with your question alex twerdahl piper sandler analyst hey good morning guys just first question on the political deposits i appreciate your commentary and expecting those to kind of level off early in the year and then decline into the election which seems like it s pretty obvious but do you have a sense for one where do you think those might decline to as we approach the election and then two drew maybe you could remind us kind of what the implications on the margin would be when those deposits actually do flow out keith mestrich president and chief executive officer so sorry on the first question just what will the timing be on those deposit outflows or is that alex twerdahl piper sandler analyst yes and then maybe where you envision i mean after the fourth quarter of 18 that went down others we re not getting in the year keith mestrich president and chief executive officer yes absolutely so the timing if we just look back to the last cycle it was really at the very end of q3 and then the beginning of q4 where we saw that outflow happen so almost no impact on q3 i think this cycle may or may not be different just given the number of candidates that are out there and we re still very unclear on who s going to be the lead democratic candidate going into the election drew labenne chief financial officer yes i mean alex i think it s a great question it s a little hard to try and put a specific pin in it our money is not all money that s being raised for the current election cycle right there s six years kind of campaign money in there some of the campaign committees don t spend down to zero i think one of the important things to remember is we have adequate liquidity on the books to make sure that we can cover any runoff that there is but it will go down substantially several hundred million dollars and then it should start to build up again in the first and second quarters of 2021 but pretty hard to put a real specific pin on exactly where that number lands on the middle of november alex twerdahl piper sandler analyst ok i mean it doesn t really matter which democratic candidate winds up carrying the ticket right i mean a lot of this money is pac money and kind of not necessarily the money that s raised by the specific candidate am i correct in that thinking drew labenne chief financial officer that s right in fact the presidential election money is just a small portion of the overall dollars that are in the political dollars it s money that pacs and super pacs are raising it s money that other candidates are raising it s money that the political campaign committees like the dnc and others are raising so it s a variable base but again hard to put an exact pin on where it lands in mid november keith mestrich president and chief executive officer and then as far as the margin impact when it goes out our current plan is certainly subject to change as that will backfill the outflow with borrowings in the short term and then hopefully fill it back up with deposits both political and nonpolitical political as the cycle starts again in terms of fundraising alex twerdahl piper sandler analyst ok and then just in the guidance for full year net income and i appreciate the yield curve commentary but can you just remind us maybe how you re positioned from a nim standpoint and kind of how we should expect that nim to progress now that all the rate cuts are kind of factored into seemingly all the rates are kind of now on the table now and kind of how you expect your loans to reprice new loans coming on the books and deposit repricing keith mestrich president and chief executive officer yes i think that with the last cut there may still be a little bit of bleed in or lag effect from that last cut coming into the next quarter as far as assets coming on the books it will really depend on the mix but i can tell you resi multifamily those are all coming in kind of the low to mid 3s at this point in terms of the yields that are coming on the books so i think there s going to be pressure on asset yields as far as those asset categories and i think some of the other assets such as pace have higher yields and as much as we re able to and i m sure we ll talk about that more in a minute but assuming we can add more pace assets as well that will help to offset some of the pressure from those lower yielding assets coming on the books with our deposit cost in particular we had a 4 deposit beta cumulatively in the upcycle so in the downcycle we re not going to see a large amount of extensive repricing because it s not going to go up slow and come down fast so i think our repricing options on the deposit side while there are some are probably going to be more limited to some of the banks that had much higher betas in the uptrend of the cycle alex twerdahl piper sandler analyst ok so is that kind of a long way of saying that you expect the margin to be mostly stable maybe a little bit of downdrift early in 2020 just based on some additional bleed through from the last rate cuts keith mestrich president and chief executive officer i would say that there will be nim pressure going into 2020 let me just put it that way i think it will be more than a couple of basis points that we ll see going forward but you can see kind of how nim compression happened from q3 to q4 that obviously had rate cuts in it but i think we will have some nim compression going into next year as well alex twerdahl piper sandler analyst thanks for taking my questions keith mestrich president and chief executive officer thanks alex operator thank you our next question is coming from the line of brian morton with barclays please proceed with your question brian morton barclays analyst good morning guys yeah i was hoping maybe to get a little bit more detail on your 2020 guidance and kind of what are the factors that could drive us to the high end of the guidance and then conversely what could drive us to the low end drew labenne chief financial officer well i think balance sheet growth and we ve obviously put a 10 target out there for overall asset growth exceeding that asset growth i think could be one of the levers obviously that would drive earnings higher fee income is another opportunity for us we are doing some work in our trust and asset management space where that could be a spot where we could grow at a faster pace than we expect just so i can get the comment in there we are still expecting runoff of that one fund from our trust department so there will be some downward pull from that fund as well but that s factored into our guidance already and then expenses i think we re always looking at expenses i think we ve taken a lot of actions this year we ll continue to look at what s possible in i m sorry in 2019 we took a lot of actions in 2020 this year we ll continue to look at what opportunities are out there as well keith mestrich president and chief executive officer yes and i would add too i think just the vibrancy of our deposit growth particularly in the noninterest bearing space has really allowed us to keep the small amount of borrowings that we keep on the books at a very very modest level and as long as that pipeline which is pretty robust right now stays robust that will help us even though we don t have as drew said a lot of downward levers that we can use in the fund pricing space the minimization of borrowings until we see the political runoff happen will be something that i think will really guide into the higher ranges of the guidance brian morton barclays analyst ok just one quick question did you repurchase any shares this quarter drew labenne chief financial officer not as much as last quarter we purchased a little over 100 000 shares which happened really at the beginning of the quarter and then the price moved up pretty rapidly and we were no longer in the market repurchasing brian morton barclays analyst all right and that totaled to how much in dollars you re saying drew labenne chief financial officer i think it was about a little under 2 million 1 5 million somewhere in that range brian morton barclays analyst ok great and then maybe my final question have you guys really looked into kind of the impact and timing of doing a cecl adoption keith mestrich president and chief executive officer well we know what a back end timing is obviously with 2023 part of our evaluation process is going to be looking at how smoothly cecl rolls out in q1 for all those banks who are adopting in this next quarter here so i think after we do that evaluation we ll think about our timing we re also talking to our investors as well and just trying to understand their thoughts on the timing brian morton barclays analyst ok great thanks keith mestrich president and chief executive officer thanks brian operator thank you our next question comes from chris o connell with kbw please proceed with your question chris o connell kbw analyst good morning keith mestrich president and chief executive officer hi chris drew labenne chief financial officer good morning chris chris o connell kbw analyst so i was hoping to drill down on some of the provision impact in this quarter do you have the exact impact of the pace reclassification on the provision and then alternatively the impact of the single c i loan moving to nonaccrual drew labenne chief financial officer yes absolutely so with pace i was waiting for a question so i could expand upon this a little bit we did determine and we re speaking with the various constituencies that we work with that the appropriate place to put the pace assets was in securities the space between loans and securities for an asset like this is somewhat gray because they are bonded assessments from various municipalities but they don t have cusips they don t freely trade in the market but after that evaluation we determined that moving them to the securities portfolio was appropriate as a result of that we released the allowance on the pace assets that we had on the balance sheet in q3 and that released 700 000 from our allowance related to those assets so it s important to note that for the securities we have now we do not have any provision against them we think they are very solid assets with very low ltvs or i guess assessment to values but there s no longer any provision against those keith mestrich president and chief executive officer before drew goes on and talks about the one c i loan let me just add a little extra commentary on the pace piece regardless if they re considered a security or a loan we think that we are very bullish on this asset class we like the yields we like the mission alignment that comes with it that has additional both reputational and public relations aspect that helps us build our deposit business as well we like the credit quality of the asset very very very much we like the efficiency with which we can put these assets on the books and the lack of servicing capacity that we have to have with them and to be very frank now the classification with them as a security and this was not the driving impact in any way but the fact that we have to set little or no allowance with them just makes them even better in our mind so securities loans we like the asset class we will continue to be bullish on them that s why we will talk more and more about asset growth as opposed to just loan growth because we think this is an important part of our strategy moving forward and frankly one that we don t have a ton of competition in right now so we feel like we ve got some expertise here this can actually be very very valuable to our franchise i m going to turn it back to drew to talk about the c i loan drew labenne chief financial officer yes so with regards to the indirect c i portfolio as a whole we re still just under 60 million in terms of the balances outstanding in that portfolio and we ve talked in the past about the three loans that had some issues in that portfolio this is one of those three loans which we downgraded to nonaccrual in the quarter we built 1 7 million in specific reserves on that loan one of the other loans actually started performing a little better and we released 0 5 million on that loan so net net between to 1 2 million in specific reserves on the indirect c i portfolio chris o connell kbw analyst got it great and then looking forward toward i guess excluding the indirect c i reserves where the actual reserve to loan will trend toward especially now that pace isn t really going to be a part of the provisioning going forward keith mestrich president and chief executive officer yes if everything stays as it is today the allowance to loans excluding specific reserves should generally trend downward right you re continuing to expand your lookback period if you have no adverse credit impacts happening then the general trend will be probably small improvements in the factors leading to a release and then we ll have the normal balance build on top of that but most of our growth has been lower factor loans that we put on the books chris o connell kbw analyst got it you said earlier i guess you know what the reserve to loan is excluding the indirect c i book right now drew labenne chief financial officer i didn t do that math let me get back to you on that i don t want to do it quick and get it wrong but i think the specifics are about 7 million sitting in the portfolio chris o connell kbw analyst got it and then in terms of the balance sheet growth the target of 10 for next year given the opportunities that you re seeing within the pace space and i think you mentioned partnership with columbia solar as well in the deck given the opportunities you re seeing there how do you see that coming in between loans versus securities growth keith mestrich president and chief executive officer yes i think it s more heavily weighted to loans and pace assessment than it is to securities we do have some level of securities growth in our forecast for next year as well but i think that is all subject to change in opportunities based on what we see available in the market and the relative risk adjusted returns of those assets at the given time chris o connell kbw analyst got it i kind of was including pace in the securities there i guess i kind of meant what s going to be coming into the actual loans on the balance sheet versus the pace and securities together as a whole drew labenne chief financial officer yes i think if you look at our balance sheet we will continue right adding loans both in the residential space both from an origination standpoint and a purchase perspective we ll continue adding loans in the multifamily space in new york that market continues to be under some pressure post rent reform regulation although we do have some pipeline and we are putting additional opportunities on the books and then in the c i bucket we will continue to see opportunities to do non pace oriented solar and renewable energy deals that would be traditional c i loans commercial solar installation and other things there is another sector we continue to be quite pleased with and seeing a lot of opportunities upcoming and in the last quarter and i referenced this in the beginning part of the thing we did hire a lender who is really focused in the community development space and we have opportunity in the affordable housing and working with other cdfi opportunities we have a nice pipeline of activities to do there those feel like very traditional c i loans so we re not just putting everything in the sort of new securities bucket if you will and just relying on pace we like that a lot but our lenders are very active in the renewable energy and community development space as well chris o connell kbw analyst great and just last one for me but do you have any idea on the timing of the two branch closures in this quarter keith mestrich president and chief executive officer yes they ve been announced both branches will close at the end of february i think actually literally the last day of february chris o connell kbw analyst great thanks for the time keith mestrich president and chief executive officer yeah thanks chris operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jp morgan please proceed with your question steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst hey good morning everyone keith mestrich president and chief executive officer hi steve steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst i wanted to first follow up on the nim commentary so if we look at loan yields and potential compression drove given the new loan yields you called out what s a reasonable pace of loan yield compression like on a run rate basis if the fed is not cutting rates drew labenne chief financial officer well it s going to depend on the mix again and the prepayments that come in as well the 12 basis points of loan yield compression that we had this quarter a little bit of that was caused by the movement as well of pace going into htm securities so i think that was a little bit elevated we obviously had the rate cut in there as well so i think it should be less than that but it will depend on the pace and speed of new originations coming on i think the other thing probably worth mentioning is for example when we look at multi family prepayments which have actually they re not where they used to be but in q4 there actually was a couple more prepayments whereas in q3 there were none a lot of what is coming off the books is kind of the same rates as what s coming on the books so it s not as though at least in the multifamily space we re having a big trade at this point in terms of yields rolling off and yields coming on in residential mortgage q4 was a big as i m sure you know was a big quarter for refi activity and so there was a little bit of yield compression that happens there whenever you get that refinance activity in mortgage seems to have slowed down but if rates continue to trend down it s the long end of the curve i m sure it will pick back up keith mestrich president and chief executive officer and steve i d just as you know i mean although the fed hasn t cut rates we ve lost 32 basis points in treasuries right over the last two weeks so it s including two basis points today so it s a tricky thing that we re looking at because some of our loans particularly in the multi families are pegged to that rate steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst right so when you think about the nim guidance for 2019 i think it was 3 55 to 3 60 you came in at the lower end of that range but you re in the range how are you thinking about a range of nim sounds like you could have much more pressure in 2020 than in 2019 drew labenne chief financial officer yes and if you think about our original guidance that was our last guidance so i think our original guidance was probably still 3 50 to 3 60 and that included no rate cuts so i think we outperformed the original guidance pretty well given what happened in the marketplace yes i mean we re not going to give guidance on nim because there are so many factors going on i think we are expecting our nii to grow we are expecting our nim to compress but i think we will probably see that for most banks in the sector especially if the yield curve keeps looking as it is over the past week or so keith mestrich president and chief executive officer just to make the point too i mean i m encouraging drew is encouraging our team right to think less about nim and more about earnings and make sure that we make decisions that are good from an earnings perspective even if they may have an adverse impact on nim in the short term and i think that s wise for us to do that particularly as we look to balance both issues in our securities portfolio and other opportunities that we have in front of us steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst right ok and then i just want to make sure i understand the commentary around pace loans now being in securities so you re guiding to double digit balance sheet growth do you think you could do double digit loan growth without pace loans and with pace now being in securities drew labenne chief financial officer i think it s possible certainly and i say this a little bit flippantly we could buy our way to any loan growth that we wanted to that s not what we re going to do we re going to be very careful on credit as we ve continued to do and we re going to make sure we re putting on at least a large portion of mission aligned assets at the same time that have attractive risk adjusted returns so i do think it s possible what we don t have this coming year or in 2020 that we had in 2019 was 177 million of indirect c i runoff that we had to also work through in 2019 so that s a big headwind that s actually out of our way for the most part in 2020 keith mestrich president and chief executive officer and it s obvious but less to be said we re not going to sort of make any sacrifice on credit right in order to just drive loan growth just not going to do that i mean we had a loan term last night that we could have put on the books i m sure and it would have deteriorated our credit standards completely and we re just not going to do that and i think that s an important principle given where we are in the cycle right now especially steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst ok i wanted to drill deeper into the pay offs in the commercial real estate book this quarter so one of your peer new york banks had good loan growth this quarter and called out how they had repurchased loans that they previously participated out to other banks are any of your paydowns from a phenomenon such as that one keith mestrich president and chief executive officer because we don t really have any participations and maybe one in that space so the answer would be no steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst no ok got it and then finally good to hear you talk about expanding right moving forward with boston and l a i assume that s in the 32 million per quarter guidance for expenses can you give us an update there where are you with hiring and when should those offices be up and running keith mestrich president and chief executive officer yes we are talking to the lead candidates in both cities i think we re a little further ahead in boston than we are in l a and my desire is to make sure i get a nice array of potential candidates to look at so i don t want to just take the first opportunity but i m hopeful that we will be able to make offers to somebody at least in boston pretty soon a little bit negotiating depending on when availability is but i would imagine boston should be up and running easily in the second quarter it would take somebody some time right to get a little finer things developing l a is a little bit behind that but l a will also have a base given our presence in california already but we re moving aggressively on this and want to get a lead banker on our model has the addition of a junior banker in each city and then somebody who really deserves an account executive role to do that again stressing we re not opening branches so we don t have a big search that we have done to go for commercial office space and things and so i m looking to do this pretty quick steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst ok great thanks for taking my questions keith mestrich president and chief executive officer yeah thanks steve steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst thanks operator thank you it appears we have no additional questions at this time so i d like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional concluding comments keith mestrich president and chief executive officer thanks operator i just want to thank everybody for taking a little time bearing with us for the day change here i appreciate everybody taking the time to hop on a day later we re really happy about the quarter and we look forward to a pretty vibrant first quarter of 2020 as well we will talk to many of you in the coming days and see many of you at the end of april thank you

fourth quarter and full year of 2019 after our remarks we will open up the call for questions reflecting on the year we generated record revenues and earnings and completed a number of strategic actions 2019 was a year of growth and transformation it s very fitting that 2020 marks the firms 125th anniversary our history is one filled with growth and change the most recent being our new name piper sandler companies our dedication to serving the best interests of clients employees shareholders and the communities where we live and work has been the foundation of our success i m excited to celebrate our 125th anniversary with clients and colleagues while executing on our future strategic priorities let me begin by providing a summary of the strategic activities that shaped 2019 and our goals for 2020 and beyond in early august we closed on the acquisition of weeden company which significantly enhances the scale of our equity brokerage business by upgrading our trading capabilities and broadening our client base in late september we closed on the sale of advisory research our traditional asset management business this business no longer fit with our strategic vision and the sale was the best course of action for our clients employees and shareholders finally early in july we announced the acquisition of sandler o neill the acquisition closed on january 3 of this year sandler adds the leading investment banking firm focused on the financial services industry to our growing investment banking platform i look forward to working with jon doyle and jimmy dunne and the fantastic team they lead in 2020 we look to build on the record financial results achieved in 2019 with sandler successfully closed we now look forward to providing clients access to the full breadth of our combined capabilities both weeden and sandler were market leaders who chose to partner with us part of our continued growth will include selectively adding partners who share our client centric culture and who can leverage the piper sandler platform to better serve clients development and retention of our own talent provides the most profitable growth and we continue to invest in the development of our future leaders next let me provide some overall comments on our financial results for 2019 and an update on our advisory and equity capital markets businesses in q4 we generated 276 million of adjusted net revenues and 2 89 of eps both quarterly records our strong finish to the year led to adjusted revenues of 824 million for 2019 and eps of 7 36 also records turning now to advisory services advisory generated quarterly revenues of 144 million up 35 from q3 and 12 from the year ago quarter q4 advisory revenues were led by our market leading healthcare franchise with strong contributions from consumer technology and industrials for the year advisory revenues were 441 million up 12 reflecting strong broad based performance our healthcare consumer and industrial teams all performed well generating record or near record results we advised on 178 transactions during the year up from 170 in 2018 we continue to focus on elevating our platform by leveraging our brand to win larger deals and enhancing our value proposition to clients by providing more products and deep sector expertise this is reflected in our median fee increasing 16 from a year ago driving increased revenues growing and broadening advisory services has been a long standing focus for us our revenues have more than doubled in the last five years reflecting strong market share gains these results are a function of internal development selective hiring and corporate development activities we ve previously discussed remixing the business toward capital light variable cost businesses such as advisory for the third year in a row advisory revenues represented over 50 of our total revenues a trend we expect will continue we re excited to add sandler to our platform a market leader in the financial services industry sandler is also an advisory led franchise with approximately 50 of revenues generated by advisory services the combination significantly elevates our advisory practice with market leadership in healthcare financial services consumer and energy and we expect to be in the top 3 of all u s investment banks in terms of deal flow trade tensions geopolitical risks and the u s presidential election create headline risk for 2020 however conditions for m a in the middle market remain conducive to transactions due to demand from pe investors attractive valuations low financing rates and continued solid economic growth our pipeline is really strong across our industry verticals albeit back half weighted again as we reload from the strong q4 turning to ecm equity financing activity finished the year very strong with q4 revenues of 43 million driven by our healthcare team for the quarter we raised 3 9 billion in capital for our clients and we re bookrunner on 76 of transactions for the full year we generated 105 million in equity financing revenues down 14 from 2018 reflecting challenges in the cyclical energy sector and the impact of the federal government shutdown in early 2019 looking forward to 2020 the combination with sandler adds a market leading franchise to our capital markets offerings and expands our platform as financial services represents a large and broad fee pool from a corporate capital raising perspective we previously set a long term goal of growing annual advisory and corporate financing revenues to 750 million with the addition of sandler we should be close to achieving that goal we see continued growth over the medium term by adding talent in certain sub sectors to broaden our industry teams and continuing to increase banker productivity we also see an opportunity to capitalize on the strength of our u s franchises by expanding in europe as a result our new goal is to grow advisory and corporate financing to over 1 billion of combined annual revenues over the next several years i will now turn the call over to deb to discuss our public finance and brokerage businesses deb schoneman managing director president thanks chad let me begin with an update on our equity brokerage business equity markets in the fourth quarter saw low volatility and volumes there were few catalysts motivating clients to trade as markets continue to advance higher despite global growth concerns and trade tensions our equity brokerage business generated revenues of 32 million for the quarter and 89 million for the year up meaningfully compared to the prior period driven by the addition of weeden to our platform on an annual basis inclusive of sandler we expect equity brokerage revenues to be approximately 130 million providing meaningful operating leverage in the business as we capitalize on cost synergies with a comprehensive suite of products one of the largest client base with the domestically focused brokers and a high quality research franchise covering 875 stocks we believe that we have a significant market share opportunity in front of us as participants consolidate toward larger broader and higher quality providers turning to our public finance business debt financing finished the year very strong with 31 million of revenues for the fourth quarter up 37 from q3 and 13 from a year ago we benefited from a surge of new issuance volume in the market as clients took advantage of low rates in addition we completed several higher spread financings as demand remained strong for high yield muni offerings in this lower interest rate environment for the full year we generated 86 million of debt financing revenues up 17 from a slow 2018 market conditions significantly improved as the year progressed driven by low rates and investor demand increased issuance for 2019 was driven by a pickup in refunding activity especially taxable refinancings and an increase in new money issuance we expect the debt financing momentum we experienced in 2019 to carry over into 2020 with another strong year of market issuance our pipeline is solid with several higher spread financings in the backlog as always our ability to execute on our backlog is contingent on market conditions investors value the tax exempt feature of municipals and differentiated high credit quality of this asset class making it a valuable component of our product capabilities our commitment and expertise in the public finance market has led to increasing market share over time and makes us a natural destination for talent looking to best serve their clients in 2019 we added nine senior bankers expanding our presence in nebraska colorado pennsylvania and ohio we are one of the most active municipal debt underwriters in the market ranking in the top 10 based on par value and top 3 based on volume of deals in the fixed income markets yields normalized in the fourth quarter as the yield curve steepened easing concerns about an inverted curve the 0 2 spread expanded from 5 basis points at september 30 to 34 basis points at year end for the quarter we generated fixed income brokerage revenues of 25 million consistent with q3 and up 73 over the very challenging year ago period for the full year we produced 95 million of revenues a 40 increase from 2018 a combination of conducive market conditions increase in client activity and strong execution drove a very successful year for our fixed income franchise it s important to note we achieved these results in a lower risk profile and with a reduced headcount and cost base driving a meaningful increase in the returns for this business looking to 2020 we re excited by the opportunities the combination with sandler presents given the complementary products and expertise now i will turn the call over to tim to review our financial results and provide an update on capital use tim carter managing director chief financial officer thanks deb my comments will be focused on our adjusted non gaap financial results however let me first highlight a few items impacting our gaap results our gaap results include amounts related to the discontinued operations of advisory research our traditional asset management business for the year we recorded net income from discontinued operations of 23 8 million or 1 65 per diluted common share which included a gain on the sale of this business in addition we incurred restructuring and integration costs of 1 8 million in q4 and 14 3 million for the full year related to the acquisitions of sandler and weeden these costs consisted of severance benefits contract termination costs and transaction related professional fees we expect to incur additional restructuring and integration costs in the first half of 2020 associated with the sandler acquisition turning to our adjusted financial results we achieved record revenues of 276 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 824 million for the full year our q4 revenues increased 36 sequentially with strong performances across investment banking but especially in equity capital markets which finished the year very strong with 43 million of revenues the highest quarterly level in over a decade compared to the year ago period quarterly revenues were up 29 with increases across all of our business lines for the year revenues increased 12 driven by growth in advisory services and an increase in fixed income brokerage revenues which rebounded 40 from the depressed 2018 levels we produced an operating margin of 20 4 for the fourth quarter generating pre tax profits of 56 million and diluted eps of 2 89 illustrating the operating leverage in the business at higher revenue levels for the year pre tax profits were 136 million an increase of 26 from 2018 by maintaining cost discipline we were able to grow profits at twice the rate of revenues this drove a 16 6 operating margin for the year a meaningful expansion from 14 7 in 2018 on a year to date basis eps was 7 36 an increase of 29 from 2018 driven by higher revenues and a higher operating margin turning to operating expenses our compensation ratio of 61 2 for the quarter was below our target range of 62 to 63 robust revenues in the quarter enabled us to leverage fixed compensation costs in the business for the full year our comp ratio was 62 at the low end of our stated range given our focus on corporate development activities in 2019 we did fewer senior investment banking hires which drove our comp ratio to the lower end of the range quarterly non comp expenses of 51 million were elevated due to increased deal related expenses driven by higher investment banking revenues for the year non comp expenses were 176 million although non comps averaged 44 million per quarter they trended higher in the second half of the year given the addition of weeden to our platform we continue to carefully manage non comp expenses as these costs are an important source of operating leverage our adjusted tax rate was 26 3 for the quarter and 22 1 for the full year the lower annual tax rate was a result of a 5 1 million tax benefit from restricted stock awards vesting at values greater than the grant price excluding this tax benefit our adjusted tax rate was 25 9 for the year over the past few years we have recorded a tax benefit resulting from restricted stock awards vesting at values greater than their grant date price however this is dependent on the share price at vesting relative to the grant date price and can result in either a tax benefit or additional tax expense for 2020 we do not expect to generate a tax benefit at the same levels as the past few years at our current share price we re projecting no tax benefit related to the awards vesting in the first quarter of 2020 also given the recent changes to our business related to corporate development and strategic activities we expect our tax rate in 2020 to increase as such we are updating our full year estimated tax rate guidance to a range of 26 to 28 turning to capital our goal is to maximize shareholder value this includes maintaining our dividend policy of returning 30 to 50 of non gaap earnings to our shareholders repurchasing shares on an opportunistic basis and to offset the dilution from stock vestings and deploying capital toward high quality acquisitions to accelerate growth in the business our relative weighting toward each of these levers is dependent on a number of factors including the market environment and our performance in the near term we are more biased toward investing in the business in regards to dividends the board approved a special cash dividend of 0 75 per share to be paid alongside the first quarter dividend when combined with the 1 50 of regular quarterly dividends total dividends for fiscal 2019 will be 2 25 per share this represents approximately 33 of our adjusted net income for 2019 the board also approved a quarterly dividend of 0 375 per share to be paid on march 13 2020 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on march 2nd 2020 in 2019 we repurchased 50 6 million or 702 000 shares of common stock at an average price of 72 09 per share in total we returned 86 million to shareholders in 2019 through dividends and share repurchases these amounts are in addition to deploying capital toward the sandler and weeden acquisitions we entered 2020 in a strong capital position with only a modest level of debt on the balance sheet we maintained the financial flexibility to continue returning capital to shareholders while investing in the business let me finish by reiterating some of the high level guidance we provided in q3 regarding our go forward operations with a full year of both weeden and sandler in our results we continue to project that sander will add approximately 300 million of revenues in 2020 going forward we expect our compensation ratio to be consistent with current levels in the range of 62 to 63 this level gives us the flexibility to continue investing in the business non comps may vary from period to period depending on the amount of deal related expenses we re adjusting our non compensation guidance to exclude the more variable deal related expenses in 2020 we estimate non comp expenses excluding deal related expenses to range from 53 million to 57 million per quarter we have revised this range to include office space consolidation costs in 2020 these office moves will generate savings in future periods and will allow us to integrate the teams across platforms and drive more connectivity and synergy among our employee partners in regards to deal related expenses these expenses should generally be viewed as a function of banking revenues based on historical experience we estimate that deal related expenses will represent approximately 3 5 to 4 of investment banking revenues before going to q a i d like to turn the call back to chad for a few additional comments chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer thanks tim let me close by thanking all my employee partners for their hard work and dedication and congratulating them on a record year and also welcoming our new employee partners from sandler the new piper sandler has an enviable market position and financial profile our market leadership sector expertise and broad product capabilities are unparalleled in the middle market with over 1 billion of annual revenues strong margins modest leverage and limited incremental operating capital needs we are nicely positioned to generate profits to further propel our growth and shareholder returns thanks and now let s open up the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you the floor is now open for questions our first question comes from the line of devin ryan of jmp securities devin ryan jmp securities analyst great good morning guys how are you chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer hi devin deb schoneman managing director president good morning devin ryan jmp securities analyst congratulations on the nice end of the year so first question just on the sandler deal so i know you re still expecting 300 million of revenue contribution at the moment and i m just curious how that number compares to what the actual kind of 2019 level was and it seems like business in the financial vertical starting on a pretty good note here so i m just trying to get some context on maybe some of the areas that might be lower relative to last year as it seems that that s the implication off of the 300 million and maybe you re leaving yourself some room for upside but just trying to think about the moving parts there chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer yes sure i can take that yeah sandler had another good year in 2019 we had disclosed in january the revenues from the last few years they had their third year in a row with revenues north of 300 million obviously that was the target we gave in july when we announced the deal we still feel very comfortable with the guidance that we expect it will add 300 million of revenues relative to some of their business segments they had another strong advisory year and i would say like our business and others we ve seen on the street a really strong finish to fixed income as well and yes i think it s true they ve got a good backlog good pipeline i think like our business just looking at some of the announced deals and projected closing dates i think they like us will be more back half weighted than first half weighted but yeah we expect another strong year terrific thanks chad and maybe a follow up for tim on the capital commentary and appreciate the detail and it sounds like the philosophy is pretty consistent but clearly the business could be throwing off a lot of cash here and i m just trying to think about any additional capital needs of the business moving forward whether there be opportunities in fixed income with the combined franchises you spent more time thinking about opportunities there or more to do on the financing side i m just trying to think about any other areas within the business that could actually consume capital relative to maybe what you re running at previously tim carter managing director chief financial officer yeah sure devin i think you re right in terms of how we continue to think about it it s really consistent with what we ve talked about before i don t think that additional capital within the business changes really all that much with the sandler acquisition i think the capital we have deployed in the various businesses i think remains fairly going forward i think we ve got some ability to leverage the combined platforms from that perspective but for us yeah it s going to continue to obviously return capital through the dividend which we very much expect to do and then look for other ways to invest in the business from a corporate development perspective and then continue to look opportunistically at share buybacks but that s probably the last priority here at least in the near term chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer yeah devin its chad i would just add we continue to be active and i think just given the growth of the platform continue to be shown interesting opportunities on the corporate development side clearly our integration with sandler has gone well i mean frankly the especially the integration on the investment banking side just given there was so little overlap that was pretty seamless and we re off to the races so i think it s unlikely we would do something large but very likely we ll continue to look at tuck in acquisitions or boutiques especially where there s very little overlap and it gives us some market leadership in some sub verticals devin ryan jmp securities analyst terrific and maybe just to end on that point so you highlighted the 1 billion plus advisory financing target it seems like you guys are you re well on the way there so maybe just kind of outline the path that you see to that and i believe that would be all organic and then to the extent there are kind of m a opportunities just maybe update us on some of those verticals that you feel like it would make more sense to buy versus build organically and even maybe to end on any other areas outside of investment banking that could be complementary inorganically to the business as you re thinking about kind of the overall corporate development chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer yeah i would take that for us i mean we like to have sort of these internal targets of where we think we re going to take the banking business and i just think back to 10 years ago when we had 150 million banking business we really felt we could drive that to 500 million we ve now had three years sort of in and around that range and as we ve said many times that came from about half organic and half corporate development i think a year ago we sort of set a new goal that we could do 750 million i think we thought that would take several years through smaller acquisitions and organic growth obviously we were very happy to partner with sandler and that probably launched us right to that 750 million mark and so now we ve just got this 1 billion target for financing and m a over the next few years and i would say that will be a combination of continued organic growth as we ve said in energy even in healthcare even in our strongest places there are sub verticals for organic growth we talked a lot about the opportunity to do more in fintech with the combination of our software platform and sandler s financial services platform but i think also in that goal would be some smaller boutiques smaller team lift outs like we talked about so i think it s a combination of those and then your last question is we d still be very open to opportunistic acquisitions or team lift outs in our public space and some of our specialty areas and then i would also just add we re the combination we re seeing some great early signs in fixed income obviously the integration in fixed income and equities is a little harder than banking since we are already in some of those businesses but i don t think it s out of the question that we could look to more corporate development and fixed income down the road as well devin ryan jmp securities analyst great thanks for all the color and taking all my questions chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer thanks devin deb schoneman managing director president thanks devin operator our next question comes from the line of chris walsh of wolfe research chris walsh wolfe research analyst hey guys good morning chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer hi chris tim carter managing director chief financial officer hey chris chris walsh wolfe research analyst congrats on the quarter chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer thank you chris walsh wolfe research analyst first one i just wanted to touch on was the ecm outlook you saw a big step up in 4q based on all the commentary from the universals that have already reported it seems like the outlook there is still fairly bullish and there might be clients that are trying to pull forward some of their equity raises in front of the u s election we re just looking for any color on what you re seeing among your client base chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer yes so i can take that we are definitely off to a better start this year in january admittedly we had a crazy low bar with the government shutdown last year but i would say we are seeing very much the same thing i think the first half will be quite active and i do think that there are people that are going to try to stay away from october and november with the election and if they were going to finance around that time they ll try to do it sooner but it s really hard to predict how that will impact the second half but i would agree generally we see pretty good climate here in the first half for ecm chris walsh wolfe research analyst and then just in terms of the sector mix i would assume that s fairly skewed toward healthcare would that be fair chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer yeah the entire sort of middle market fee pool in ecm has continued to concentrate even more in healthcare obviously we re really strong in healthcare so that s good for us but even our ecm results were impacted we did much less energy ecm last year than we did the year before so i actually expect we ll do a little better in some of the other sectors this year but the lion s share again will be healthcare and obviously we re really excited to add the financial services fee pool for ecm because that s a fairly large people chris walsh wolfe research analyst and then just one last one on the advisory business you said there are a higher number of transactions but also an increase in median fees which i think you said were up 16 over the course of 2019 it d be great if you could just comment on the underlying drivers there that have been driving your median fee rate higher chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer yeah so our median fee rate went up it s sometimes when you re looking at an average it can be driven by the bigger the bigger tickets obviously here we re talking about the median fee i would just say and this is true for our outperformance in q4 we had a couple of nice transactions slightly north of 10 million but the massive or the biggest part of our revenue stream really just came from fees 2 million to 5 million we just see more and more 3 million 4 million 5 million fees as our lots of our bankers are doing somewhat larger transactions so i think all of that has helped we still do plenty of 1 5 million fee so that s in the sweet spot of the middle market but we re definitely just seeing more 3s 4s and 5s on the advisory side chris walsh wolfe research analyst awesome thanks chad operator our next question comes from the line of michael brown of kbw michael brown kbw analyst hi good morning guys chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer hi deb schoneman managing director president good morning tim carter managing director chief financial officer hey mike michael brown kbw analyst so appreciate the color on sandler integration just kind of wondering are you seeing any material changes and how you re viewing some of the synergy potential across the platforms and then specifically on the expense side how far along is integration i understand it s been only a couple of weeks but is there still kind of more redundancies that need to be eliminated and kind of how should we think about how is that path will play out through 2020 chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer yeah i ll take the first stab at that obviously we look at synergies two ways what are the revenue opportunities and then on the expense side i think relative to the revenue opportunities obviously we haven t we re early days and we haven t sort of closed any of those transactions through cross referrals but we re definitely seeing across public finance and our various industry groups lots of collaboration lots of relationships and so we do still think in the long term we ll see some revenue pickup and as when we announced the deal in july relative to expenses this transaction sandler already ran very efficient operating margins and while there are some opportunities for cost synergies sort of as planned and we re still sort of tracking those the transaction was never about super huge cost synergies and there ll be things that go the other way we re actually looking now with some offices that we ve got an ability to consolidate more quickly so we may end up having some more double rents this year but we feel really really good about the combination how the early teams are working together ultimately over the long term we will get some more cost synergies but that wasn t the big driver here in the short term michael brown kbw analyst great thank you and then the 17 to 19 targeted operating margin you hit 16 6 this year can you just remind us kind of what s the timeline that you expect to kind of achieve that post the sandler integration tim carter managing director chief financial officer yeah mike you re right i mean we saw a pretty big expansion this year i think just there is a lot of leverage that can be in the business that levels as we look at it sort of going forward we may not get to that targeted level in 2020 partly based on some of the costs that we ve talked about chad mentioned sort of this occupancy piece that as we consolidate we ve got some additional costs in 2020 so it may not get to that level in the near term but there is a clear path to get to that level evidenced by sort of the leverage that you see in 2019 and obviously with the sandler acquisition coming in it drives earnings nicely and is sort of in line with what we plan from an overall earnings accretion perspective chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer and i would just add i mean when we announced that in july that was obviously based on sandler having really good margins some opportunity to get some minimal expense synergies so our target was in the first couple of years we could get to the bottom of that and it might take a couple more years to get to the top of that but we still very much believe on a combined basis we can get to the top of that range michael brown kbw analyst okay great thank you for the color on that and just one more for kind of modeling purposes as we think about the quarterly trajectory in 2020 heard you loud and clear on kind of the back half waiting for investment banking obviously with the integration of weeden the brokerage business certainly has a little bit of a different quarterly trajectory as well so any color there as to how you expect those revenues to flow through and then is there any other seasonality we need to make sure we consider in our modeling deb schoneman managing director president yeah maybe starting with equities as you were just speaking to with in one of the things as you probably know as we ve seen more cyclicality of that business historically as we paid for research more in the maybe second half of the year not perfectly clear what that will look like as we head into a new year with the combined platform but clearly having a stronger execution platform in a commission management business there it is likely we could see some less cyclicality but left to be played out and then maybe i would also just note on the public finance business is a business that historically has had pretty weak q1s over the last number of years and we re feeling good about the momentum we re seeing carrying over from q4 into q1 not necessarily at that same level but maybe more than we ve seen historically chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer yeah and i would just say yeah relative to the rest of the business i mean if you go back 15 years or 20 years usually four years out of the five years were stronger in the back half than the first half and that can be sometimes skewed based on some big transactions in q1 q2 we feel very good about our visibility in the pipeline and we re off to a good start but we re highly confident in the pipeline but really do think it will be the closures maybe not the announced deals but the closures will be and the revenue recognition will be more back half weighted michael brown kbw analyst thanks for taking my question deb schoneman managing director president thank you operator our next question comes from the line of mike grondahl of northland securities mike grondahl northland securities analyst hi yeah congratulations on the great year kind of transformational and also the strong fourth quarter chad you talk about a 122 investment banking mds what is a rough range to think about that maybe one year from now and two years from now what would you like to get that to as you make some tuck ins or contemplate some tuck ins chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer yeah no i think that s a good question i mean when we were kind of operating close to 90 mds on our own obviously with the combination about half of our financial services team joined the sandler platform plus you had their mds so that s sort of why we use the 122 mds that s sort of as of january 3 how many mds we had that number does not include our own organic promotion class which we will announce in march which is one of our larger classes so i sort of expect and hope we could end in the high 120s maybe close to 130 this year and yeah we sort of targeted to get to that 1 billion that s probably 150 md or 160 md number over the next three years four years five years and i would say probably that incremental 20 md will come through a combination of organic hires and team lift outs and internal development mike grondahl northland securities analyst got it that s helpful anything to call out i know you did a lot of planning with sandler before the close it s closed less than a month but anything that you re really delighted with so far or maybe even a little bit pleasantly surprised with chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer yeah i mean maybe i ll give you a couple of things i mean the sandler folks are super collaborative i think you can just tell from their culture of how they run the business the last 30 years everybody thinks about driving revenue across sort of silos or products it doesn t matter i mean they re all sort of sharing our relationships already bringing us ideas and different verticals so i m very optimistic about that and i would just say if there is sort of a little extra giddy up in our step it s just the opportunity in fixed income we re seeing some very cool things across the combination of our two platforms that it s going to take a while for us to see major upside on that revenue but some of the stories are quite fun mike grondahl northland securities analyst and just lastly on the fixed income side is it more clients cross sell product maybe just detail that a little bit more for us on fixed income deb schoneman managing director president yeah fixed income from a client perspective we really saw minimal overlap unlike maybe the equity side of business as you think about bringing in both sandler and weeden so it s really more i would say in a combination of product and analytics and expertise and on both sides both sandler and piper historically had different expertise in different products call it in sa municipals and some other taxable product on our side and things like loan trading and derivatives products and things that are more unique that in both cases we can leverage that across our broader client platform mike grondahl northland securities analyst got it great and hey good luck in 2020 deb schoneman managing director president thanks mike chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer thanks mike operator and that was our final question i d like to turn the floor back over to chad abraham for any additional or closing remarks chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer okay thanks operator we look forward to updating you again in april and hope everybody has a great day thank you very much operator duration 44 minutes call participants chad abraham

the stats it was a busy week on the economic calendar in the week ending 31st january a total of just 60 stats were monitored in the week following 46 stats from the previous week of the 60 stats 23 came in ahead forecasts with 24 economic indicators coming up short of forecast 13 was in line with forecasts in the week looking at the numbers 29 of the stats reflected an upward trend from previous

spot index ended the week down by 0 47 to 97 390 a 0 49 slide on friday delivered the weekly loss out of the u s it was a busy week on the economic data front in the early part of the week consumer confidence and durable goods orders delivered mixed results for the greenback a rise in consumer confidence and better than anticipated durable goods orders were positives while a fall in core durable goods orders limited any major upside through the 2nd half of the week 4th quarter gdp numbers failed to impress ahead of a busy end to the week on friday the fed s preferred core pce price index figures for december personal spending and january s chicago pmi also influenced in december the annual rate of inflation held steady at 1 6 sitting well short of the fed s 2 objective while personal spending continued to deliver up by 0 3 manufacturing sector activity in chicago weighed heavily the chicago pmi slumped from 48 2 to 42 9 in january housing sector figures trade data and finalized consumer sentiment numbers had a muted impact in the week while the stats influenced it was also the fed s first policy decision of the year which left rates unchanged fed chair powell raised concerns over the possible effect of the coronavirus on china and the global economy however with market jitters already leading to a flattening in the 3 month 10 year yield curve on tuesday powell s comments led to inversion on wednesday on friday the yield on 3 month treasuries stood at 1 54 with the yields on 10 year down at 1 51 story continues in the equity markets the dow fell by 2 53 with the s p500 and nasdaq falling by 2 12 and by 1 76 respectively out of the uk it was a particularly quiet week on the economic calendar there were no material stats out of the uk to rock the pound the lack of stats left the pound under pressure with market risk aversion weighing on the pound ahead of thursday s boe monetary policy decision while expectations were for the boe to stand pat on policy forward guidance was key better than expected private sector pmi and employment figures did the trick in the week prior the vote count in favor of a rate cut delivered the upside for the pound in the week the markets had priced in a 3rd vote in favor of a rate cut just 2 members of the mpc voted in favor of a cut driving the pound back into positive territory not even britain s last day in the eu could pin back the pound the pound ended the week up by 1 02 to 1 3206 the ftse100 slid by 3 95 with negative sentiment towards the coronavirus and a stronger pound weighing out of the eurozone it was a busy week on the economic data front through the 1st half of the week economic data focused on germany disappointing ifo business climate index figures weighed on the eur at the start of the week while sentiment towards current conditions improved negative sentiment towards the economic outlook weighed on wednesday the markets brushed aside consumer confidence figures with coronavirus news in focus in the 2nd half of the week german and eurozone unemployment figures provided much needed support on friday however the stats failed to impress the eurozone economy saw growth slow from 0 2 to 0 1 in the 4th quarter year on year the economy grew by 1 0 slowing from 1 2 in the 3rd quarter retail sales figures from the end of the year also failed to impress german retail sales slumped by 3 3 reversing a 1 6 rise in november french consumer spending fell by 0 3 with the ecb reliant upon consumer spending to support growth it was a bad day on the data front the slide in consumer spending and weaker gdp numbers were joined with softer inflation figures for the week the eur rose by 0 62 to 1 1093 even negatively skewed numbers were not enough to offset the fed chair s cautious tone from wednesday and some weak numbers out of the u s for the eur lagarde had prepared the markets for some disappointment at last week s ecb press conference for the european major indexes it was a bearish week the dax30 led the way tumbling by 4 38 with the cac40 and eurostoxx600 down by 3 62 and by 3 05 respectively elsewhere it was a particularly bearish week for the aussie dollar and kiwi dollar for the week the aussie dollar slid by 2 05 to 0 6692 with the kiwi dollar tumbling by 2 16 to 0 6464 for the aussie dollar it was a relatively busy week for the aussie dollar with stats doing little to provide support business confidence waned in december as had been anticipated which was aussie dollar negative and raised pressure on the rba to make a move 4th quarter inflation figures on wednesday came in ahead of forecasts but the upside was not enough to prevent a near term rate cut by the rba in the 4th quarter the annual rate of inflation came in at 1 8 while finding early support on the day the aussie dollar slipped back into the red with the effects of the coronavirus on the chinese economy and the bush fires in australia being 2 major negatives for the aussie in the second half of the week 4th quarter wholesale inflation figures were aussie dollar negative on friday while in line with forecasts the annual rate of wholesale inflation eased from 1 6 to 1 4 providing further support for a rate cut for the kiwi dollar economic data in the week was limited to december trade figures while the numbers were on the positive side negative sentiment towards the coronavirus weighed the prospect of an extended period of economic disruption in china was kiwi dollar negative december s trade data revealed new zealand s increased reliance on china exports to china accounted for 28 of total exports in december a likely material slide in demand stemming from china s shut down over the coronavirus doesn t bode well expectations had been for the rbnz to stand pat on monetary policy should we see the spread extend through the rest of the quarter expect a material impact on growth for the loonie after a dovish bank of canada the markets had to wait until the end of the week for direction economic data included november gdp numbers and december s rmpi figures month on month the economy grew by 0 1 in november with the rmpi jumping by 2 8 in december that gives some breathing space to the boc though next week s stats will need to provide support the numbers provided little support however concerns over the impact of the coronavirus on the chinese economy and demand for crude weighed in the week the loonie ended the week down by 0 72 to c 1 3237 against the greenback for the japanese yen there were no material stats until a relatively busy friday through the week market risk sentiment towards the coronavirus provided support for the safe havens and the yen in particular the continued spread of the virus and rise in the death toll in the week came in spite of governments making efforts to stop the spread china s outlook for growth and domestic consumption looks dire as entire cities remain in lockdown with no immediate end in sight and the who raising the international status to a global emergency the shutdown could drag on a slide in demand from china would force central banks into action which will make the markets all the more sensitive to economic indicators in the coming weeks the boj may have to finally make a move stats on friday were skewed to the negative with inflationary pressures easing and retail sales sliding the only positive was a pickup in industrial production though this may be temporary the japanese yen rose by 0 85 to 108 35 against the u s dollar for the week out of china the markets were closed for the week with the government forced to extend the cny holiday market sentiment towards the coronavirus was the key driver in the week while the chinese government did its best to contain the virus the spread continued weighing on risk appetite at the end of the week the markets brushed aside mixed private sector pmi numbers the concern is now over the remainder of the 1st quarter and not the start

anthony lanzilote bloomberg 2020 bloomberg finance lp pity the poor tortured north american free trade agreement nafta the 1994 trilateral trade deal that fundamentally transformed the continent into a unified growth engine the rest of the world envied after two and a half decades of course the need to update some of nafta s provisions made sense there is however a dirty little secret about its planned successor the united states mexico canada agreement usmca will not produce progressive but rather regressive economic impacts on u s businesses and workers producing automobiles steel and aluminum the very sectors washington purports to especially want to help the most from the new trade regime at this juncture although the usmca has been enacted by the u s and mexican governments it must still be approved by canada s parliament and subsequently signed by prime minister trudeau it then will become effective only after the three governments complete a number of pre implementation activities which will take months after more than a year of negotiations launched by president trump four months after he moved into the white house in january 2017 making good on his campaign promise to revise what he called the worst trade agreement ever the first version of usmca usmca 1 0 was signed by the leaders of the three north american countries on november 30 2018 on the sidelines of the g 20 summit in buenos aires that was arguably the high point of the usmca while what turned out to be usmca 1 0 had a number of provisions that were moderately protectionist although some of these had little if any rationale for being included in an agreement centered on intra north american commerce insofar as they focus on trying to tame china s trade practices see below usmca 1 0 did help to improve several aspects of nafta after all it s modernization was certainly called for indeed nafta wasn t perfect and i say this as a former senior negotiator of the original 26 year old hemispheric agreement but it significantly reduced long standing fundamental barriers to commerce between the three north american countries the agreement was a real game changer following its enactment intra hemispheric trade and investment exploded expectations about the economic benefits that would flow to the u s from usmca 1 0 have been extremely modest as the forerunner of trump s growing infatuation with managed trade which is far more pronounced in his recent phase one trade deal with china that may well be a significant understatement the u s international trade commission an independent bipartisan government agency had estimated that version of the agreement would boost u s economic growth only 0 35 and that is over a six year period the most progressive changes incorporated into the usmca compared to nafta are a few provisions borrowed from the far newer and thus more innovative trans pacific partnership agreement tpp agreed to between the u s and 11 other countries by the obama administration in february 2016 ttp encompassed the largest free trade agreement ever negotiated that provisions from the tpp turned up in the usmca is truly ironic why because shortly after his inauguration trump withdrew the us from tpp calling it a disaster done and pushed by special interests who want to rape our country clearly mr trump does not mince words when it comes to criticizing trade agreements negotiated before he assumed the presidency hardly news to those of us who closely follow international investment and trade matters the contents of usmca 1 0 then took a turn for the worst following the democrats assuming control of the u s house of representatives as a result of the november 2018 mid term elections the new majority set in motion a plan to coax out the barely concealed but not yet fully deployed ardent protectionist tendencies of trump and his u s trade representative robert lighthizer as soon as democrats took over the house they ratcheted up their long standing argument that nafta was primarily responsible for erstwhile u s located businesses to close up shop and relocate south of the border to take advantage of low wage mexican labor indeed the new majority did so knowing that they would have trump and lighthizer as strong allies on this point who would be susceptible to congressional pressure to put a pause on enactment of usmca 1 0 the result they stalled congressional action on formally approving usmca 1 0 and demanded from the white house that negotiations be reopened one element of usmca 1 0 the democrats quickly sought and succeeded in to strip away was a provision that would have given 10 years of protection to expensive biologic drugs from generic substitutes but their real focus was elsewhere as has been the case with china they played into messrs trump s and lighthizer s penchant for single mindedly focusing on the existence of u s bilateral merchandise trade deficits with trading partners as a measure of the costs to the nation of a trading relationship never mind that any economics 101 student will tell you that bilateral trade balances in and of themselves are economically meaningless nor moreover that throughout the world for developed and developing countries alike the flows of international trade in merchandise are increasingly dwarfed by cross border transactions in services indeed there is overwhelming empirical evidence that the growth of services industries whether within the confines of a single country or manifested in transactions across national borders has become the most powerful driver of economic growth and prosperity nonetheless in re negotiating usmca 1 0 the white house egged on by the congress dwelled on inserting additional provisions that it believes will cure the u s bilateral merchandise trade deficits with mexico and with canada in the case of canada in 2018 the latest year for which full year data are currently available the us ran a merchandise trade deficit of 19 1 billion but it actually recorded a surplus of 28 2 billion in services trade with mexico in 2018 the u s had a merchandise trade deficit that totaled 80 7 billion and a surplus in services trade of 8 0 billion it thus should be no surprise that mexico s bilateral merchandise trade deficit was the key target so what does usmca 2 0 at least the version that has now been formally passed by the legislatures of mexico and the u s and signed by the two countries presidents include all told on the face of it the newest uscma still incorporates much of the original nafta nevertheless there are some significant changes and additions it would be stretching the truth however to call the bulk of these new elements as trade opening with virtually only one exception enlarging u s farmers access to canadian dairy markets usmca 2 0 s provisions serve to erect new trade barriers and make our hemispheric trilateral trade agreement more not less protectionist is it any wonder that the words free trade embodied in nafta s name are omitted in the title of usmca here are some of the most significant elements that account for the major differences between the agreement of 26 years ago and the current one managed trade in automobile production first there is greater stringency in the rules of origin regarding automobile production the criteria that specify thresholds such activity must meet if the autos assembled are to be considered as being built within north america and thus receive preferential tariff treatment under nafta 62 5 of a car had to have been constructed in the u s mexico or canada in order to qualify in the usmca that level has been raised to 75 second the new agreement adds rules of origin requiring that 70 of carmakers steel and aluminum components must originate from within north america the intent here is clear to require that a greater portion of what largely comprises car bodies must originate in north america not imported more cheaply from china and elsewhere third the usmca adds wholly new rules of origin provisions pertaining to attributes of workers employed in automobile manufacturing specifically at least 40 percent of the parts of a car must be produced by workers earning 16 per hour or greater that objective is also clear to benefit automobile manufacturing businesses in the united states and canada at the expense of those in mexico where workers in the auto industry receive wages significantly below 16 per hour taken together these three modifications all in the trumpian direction of managed trade which is best exemplified in his trade agreements with china actually produce perverse effects for u s and canadian automobile companies their workers and consumers in a word they are regressive why is that because they will serve to only raise those companies production costs thus making them less not more competitively priced internationally and thus decrease north american automobile exports to the rest of the world these rising costs will also hasten the introduction of automation into the car industry moreover in and of themselves they do not put in place safeguards to ensure the autos are produced in a more environmentally friendly fashion and that the cars would be more environmentally benign than current models this latter point is surprising given the legitimate vociferousness of democrats to steer trade deals to reduce not enhance climate change all of this will come back to haunt u s interests mainly the unions in the automotive sector who pushed hard for these provision and to which trump and lighthizer acceded either trump or lighthizer do not understand the contradictory elements at play here or they are being machiavellian oversight of mexican labor reform an equally significant change embodied in the usmca compared to nafta pertains to u s oversight of obligations mexico has taken on to improve the country s working conditions and liberalize wage growth while the mexican authorities in their own right over the last few years have been engaged in labor market reform to boost the nation s economic growth and prosperity the usmca contains provisions mexico city views as tantamount to extra territorial enforcement by the u s of such reforms the most visible manifestation of this is inclusion into the agreement the constitution of u s manned labor inspection panels to be located on mexican soil in order for the us to monitor regularly mexico s own compliance with the pace and extent of its labor market reforms dispute settlement under nafta canada u s and mexico had the ability to settle investor state disputes isds utilizing arbitration mediated by independent tribunals usmca significantly curtails that procedure after the usmca comes into force canada will no longer participate in such procedures for the u s and mexico isds will generally exist between those two parties only for disputes related to infrastructure oil and natural gas power generation and telecommunications however in cases involving other sectors isds will be available only after claimants have sought and failed to achieve remedies in local courts first poison pill for china untouched in usmca 2 0 relative to usmca 1 0 but certainly a new matter compared to nafta is the provision the u s tucked away in the second to last part of the 32nd chapter article 32 10 of the 34 chapters that constitute the text of agreement the provision unmistakably referencing china states that entry by any party into a free trade agreement with a non market country shall allow the other parties to terminate this agreement on six month notice what s the objective here the u s is threatening both mexico and canada to not even think about establishing a free trade agreement with china lest the u s back out of the usmca the trump white house hopes to incorporate this poison pill clause in other new bilateral or plurilateral trade agreements the u s concludes with trading partners outside north america hoping to coerce them into shunning expanded trade deals with china it is quite incredulous that the u s has put forth this mechanism indeed referring to it in the context of a free trade agreement not only is the usmca a managed trade agreement but also how can a non market economy be a party to a free trade agreement is this contradiction in terms not apparent to the white house the victory proclaimed by the trump administration for the creation of usmca as a modernized nafta is truly a hollow one despite several years wrangling with our immediate neighbors to the north and south our second and third largest trading partners in fact few substantive changes have been introduced to the original 1994 pact that will enhance the hemisphere s free flow of trade
the coronavirus doesnâ t matter eitherâ we have the federal reserve as the coronavirus continues to spread global financial markets are showing the symptoms of investor unease chinese and emerging markets stocks have taken a big hit over the past several days as have commodities crude oil prices have dropped 13 over the past two weeks while copper has seen a 12 drop on concerns about the impact of the china virus on global demand gold is faring much better as some investors seek out the precious metals for safe haven protection up 1 for the week markets brushed off the federal reserve s policy announcement on wednesday the fed kept rates unchanged as expected chairman jerome powell reiterated the central bank s policy of symmetric inflation targeting that translates into allowing inflation rates to rise above the fed s 2 target for a sustained period to make up for recent periods where it ran below 2 obviously the central planners on the federal reserve board remain unsatisfied with the level of price increases consumers face food and fuel are still too cheap they say medical care and college tuitions are too affordable for too many people and it s all because the dollar isn t depreciating fast enough for the fed s arbitrary inflation target to be hit the u s dollar index is firming so far this year and the threat of a global pandemic has policymakers concerned that consumers and businesses will hunker down and further depress price levels in dollar terms the mainstream media and political correctness police have other concerns as top priorities no it isn t about the risk of americans being infected from international travel into the u s it s about the risk of chinese people being stereotyped and subjected to racism and sinophobia meanwhile cnn alerted americans to the alarming fact that president donald trump s coronavirus task force isn t diverse enough badgering people about what they look like is apparently helpful in fighting the spread of a deadly disease thank goodness there are journalists willing to do such brave and heroic work and thank goodness the fed stands ready during any potential national emergency to pump limitless amounts of cash into the repo market and banking system on thursday the federal reserve bank of new york pumped another 83 billion in new liquidity into short term lending markets the move saved the banks from having to sort out their own illiquidity issues for another week unfortunately for other industries automakers in particular the fed can t liquify the markets for palladium and rhodium by injecting fresh supplies of metals the markets for these critical metals used in catalytic converters remain beset by physical supply deficits this in turn is causing unusual spikes in leasing rates and distortions in pricing mechanisms as bid ask spreads widen according to refnitiv gfms the palladium market will operate under a supply deficit of 883 000 ounces this year prices may have to rise even higher for the already pricey metal before supply and demand reach an equilibrium we would caution that it s pretty late in the cycle to be a buyer of palladium here the good news is that it s still very early in the cycle for other metals including lagging platinum and dirt cheap silver consider that in 2016 palladium began the year trading around 500 oz prices have since quintupled silver bottomed in at the very end of 2015 just below 14 oz prices advanced strongly that year before falling back into a major trading range silver has managed to make only modest net progress a mere quadrupling from its late 2015 low would take silver over 50 and that would likely just be the warm up phase that finally establishes new all time highs then the explosive phase could begin that sees new high after new high week after week just like we ve seen in palladium over the past year when silver and gold prices are making new records perhaps the fed will finally have the inflation it so desperately wishes for pushing inflation rates back down though won t be so easy once the genie is out of the bottle it can t exactly be put back in by mike gleason moneymetals com mike gleason is

as the rest of the world backed away from the deal table confident us corporates continued buying businesses especially in the life sciences and tmt sectors and particularly in the domestic market us dealmakers had a strong 2019 with 5 757 deals targeting us companies valued at a total of us 1 53 trillion this represents a 10 percent decline in volume but value is practically the same as the previous year s tally making it the third highest total on record meanwhile global m a value fell by 8 percent in addition this value figure gave the us a global market share of 47 percent the second highest percentage on record buoyed by confidence in the domestic economy deals continued to get over the line in the us while numerous other regions took a slight pause for breath economic stability in late 2018 fears of a trade war and concerns that a downturn may emerge during 2019 led to volatile public markets but the dow jones industrial average was up by 23 percent in 2019 the us economy is

statistics which show the unemployment rate stabilized at approximately 3 5 percent the outlook is bright megadeal movement this positive sentiment is reflected in the pattern of m a activity for the year confident corporates did big deals to extend their geographic and market reach megadeals those valued at us 5 billion or more increased by 23 percent from us 723 9 billion in 2018 to us 888 billion in 2019 they accounted for 58 percent of the total deal value for 2019 a significant increase on the 47 percent seen in 2018 4 785 the number of us domestic deals in 2019 megadeal activity was driven mainly by two sectors life sciences and tmt the former had the highest megadeal total with us 180 8 billion across eight transactions as big pharma companies increasingly seek defensive biotechnology products and capability meanwhile tmt saw 11 deals valued at us 134 5 billion reflecting the ongoing convergence of industries as digital disruption continues apace us 325 8 billion the value of us inbound deals in 2019 an increase from the us 287 billion seen in 2018 middle market muted activity involving large us 1 billion to us 4 99 billion and middle market us 5 million to us 999 million deals was down by value and volume compared to 2018 high valuations may have played a role in this dynamic the megadeals of 2019 often used stock consideration to mitigate the high cost of acquisitions the largest deal of the year bristol myers squibb s us 89 5 billion purchase of celgene is one example as is the us 88 9 billion merger of united technologies corporation and raytheon in the mid market and below buyers need to fund deals largely through cash and despite continued liquidity in the debt markets and retained cash on balance sheets buyers may be more circumspect when faced with high valuations companies that don t play in the megadeal space typically have fewer resources dedicated to m a deals and they may be more prone to caution in light of a possible downturn particularly in a sellers market dominated by auction activity after several years of benign economic conditions a survey carried out in the summer of 2019 by the national association for business economics found that 72 percent of economists were predicting a downturn in 2020 or 2021 domestic deals dominate at the larger end with a strengthening of the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius regulations see page 5 and ongoing uncertainty around the effect of us china trade tariffs through 2019 it is perhaps unsurprising that domestic transactions dominated the megadeal space nine of the top ten deals of 2019 were domestic with only the uk based london stock exchange s us 27 billion acquisition of financial markets data and infrastructure provider refinitiv bucking the trend however the focus on large domestic deals also reflects greater appetite among us buyers for us assets given the strength of the economy relative to some other markets the european union is forecast to grow by just 1 4 percent in 2019 for example while the focus at the top end was on domestic deals figures across home grown inbound and outbound m a mirrored the market s overall pattern 2019 has seen 4 785 domestic deals worth us 1 2 trillion a fall of 9 percent by volume and 4 percent by value year on year which is similar to the overall market the volume of inbound deals also fell by 13 percent to 972 while the value increased from us 286 5 billion in 2018 to us 325 8 billion in 2019 with outbound deal numbers dropping by 5 percent to 1 337 transactions and a consistent value of us 338 7 billion this is despite an increased focus on foreign acquirers by authorities in many markets including the us as well as greater coordination between countries on antitrust legislation see page 7 for sellers cfius has become a bigger issue when preparing for a deal and while there may be additional scrutiny on the execution prowess of overseas buyers the totals for inbound m a suggest that increased scrutiny is not proving to be a deal breaker firrma gets firmer from february by farhad jalinous karalyn mildorf in february 2020 new regulations implementing the foreign investment risk review modernization act firrma will come into force this is a major step in the overhaul of the foreign direct investment review process conducted by the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius some of the key changes involve an expansion of transactions that are included in the scope of cfius s jurisdiction including certain non controlling but non passive investments in us businesses involving critical technology critical infrastructure or sensitive data referred to as tid us businesses in addition the new regulations expand cfius s jurisdiction to include certain real estate purchases leases and concessions prior to firrma cfius s jurisdiction was limited to foreign control of us businesses and the cfius review was for the most part a voluntary process under firrma certain qualifying investments in us businesses involved with critical technology and investments by entities with substantial foreign government ownership in tid us businesses can be subject to mandatory filing requirements and there are potentially harsh penalties for non compliance foreign investors take note companies will need to give greater consideration in the early stages of a transaction to both jurisdictional and substantive cfius issues this means buyers including investors purchasing minority stakes in tid us businesses will need to conduct cfius focused due diligence which under the new rules can be a complex and fact specific assessment to determine whether the transaction triggers a mandatory filing if not they should then consider whether it is advisable to make a voluntary filing and what impact that may have on their bid finally consideration must be given to whether a fast track declaration or a full filing is the best course parties also need to be sensitive to these issues when allocating cfius risk in their purchase agreements and if an overseas investor opts not to file it needs to understand the risks of cfius requesting a filing notably under firrma cfius has increased resources to pursue non notified transactions and has been ramping up such efforts additionally in 2018 cfius announced the issuance of its first ever monetary penalty a us 1 million fine for violation of a mitigation agreement family offices make their presence felt by kerry o rourke perri over the past few years family offices have become an increasing force in the investment and deal markets a recent study by campden research estimates that the total assets under management among the projected 7 300 family offices worldwide currently stands at us 5 9 trillion the proportion of family office capital flowing towards private companies is also on the rise both through traditional private equity funds and direct private investments and investors are achieving strong returns with these strategies a family office exchange report from june 2019 found that private equity fund investments by family offices averaged 11 1 percent in 2018 with direct investments averaging 16 8 percent according to a 2019 ubs study 39 percent of family offices expect to increase their allocations to direct investments in 2020 while a number of these investors may have cut their teeth on co investments alongside private equity funds it seems that many are now starting to seek out deals for themselves this affords them the opportunity to do away with the fee structures associated with fund investments as well as offering them far greater control over investments family values in addition family offices are taking different approaches to direct investment than those taken by private equity family offices often have longer investment horizons than traditional funds and so can appeal to other family business sellers who wish to retain a stake over the long term and can tolerate longer market cycles they also tend to favor local investments 85 percent of north american family offices are more likely to invest in north american companies according to a fintrx buy side study and investments with a direct link to their experience and background family offices are also more focused on the social and environmental impact of the investments than many buyout firms a third of family offices engage in sustainable investing according to the ubs survey as the firepower of family offices increases and their appetite for direct deals grows they could become a significant competitor to private equity however it also seems likely that family offices will target somewhat different investments thus adding to the private company financing ecosystem at a time when more companies are opting for a private as opposed to public ownership structure good neighbors canada was the most active acquirer of us businesses accounting for 203 deals worth a total of us 55 1 billion even as the us mexico canada agreement usmca trade agreement remained unratified at the end of 2019 the largest inbound deal with a canadian bidder was brookfield asset management s us 9 6 billion purchase of oaktree capital the uk was in second place for value and volume with 164 deals worth us 49 8 billion led by lse s acquisition of refinitiv for us 27 billion china hasn t been a top ten bidder for inbound us deals since 2017 when it ranked sixth by volume and seventh by value antitrust a view on vertical deals by rebecca farrington over the last decade the number of transactions reported to antitrust authorities in the us has risen significantly in 2009 there were 716 reported deals by the fiscal year 2018 this had risen nearly threefold to 2 111 deals interest from us antitrust authorities has generally been steady but is rising in certain areas while there is a trend toward greater scrutiny of certain m a activity in the us what is less clear at this stage is the extent to which we will see an overhaul of antitrust one area of increased and demonstrated interest is in examining the effect of vertical mergers though the doj s attempt to prevent the at t time warner tie up failed the ftc and doj in january jointly issued draft vertical merger guidelines for public comment this much anticipated update to the 1984 guidelines gives a framework for evaluating vertical mergers under the antitrust laws while reflecting new economic understandings the draft guidelines largely follow and attempt to define and frame what is essentially an existing consensus view on analyzing the competitive effects of vertical mergers the fact that the guidelines have been issued shows that vertical mergers will continue to be an area of interest for the ftc and doj don t wait act on antitrust companies engaging in m a on both buy and sell sides will need to continue to consider early on whether a transaction is likely to raise antitrust questions and what remedies may be required these are considerations not just in a us context the increase in mandatory pre merger clearances globally means parties need to organize their global clearance strategies carefully to ensure consistency in advocacy and timing looking ahead as we move into 2020 it seems likely that m a activity will continue to be robust as long as the economy continues to grow and confidence remains high there are some concerns about an eventual downturn but that inevitability provides opportunities for buyers that are experienced with distressed assets the upcoming presidential elections may also have an effect on m a activity particularly depending on which democratic candidate wins the nomination but we d expect activity to be brisk in the early part of the year as companies seek to complete deals well ahead of any potential change in administration
the stats fxempire com it was a busy week on the economic calendar in the week ending 31st january a total of just 60 stats were monitored in the week following 46 stats from the previous week of the 60 stats 23 came in ahead forecasts with 24 economic indicators coming up short of forecast 13 was in line with forecasts in the week looking at the numbers 29 of the stats reflected an upward trend from previous figures of the remaining 31 24 stats reflected a deterioration from previous for the greenback it was a choppy week we saw the dollar spot peak at 98 19 on wednesday before hitting reverse the dollar spot index ended the week down by 0 47 to 97 390 a 0 49 slide on friday delivered the weekly loss out of the u s it was a busy week on the economic data front in the early part of the week consumer confidence and durable goods orders delivered mixed results for the greenback a rise in consumer confidence and better than anticipated durable goods orders were positives while a fall in core durable goods orders limited any major upside through the 2nd half of the week 4th quarter gdp numbers failed to impress ahead of a busy end to the week on friday the fed s preferred core pce price index figures for december personal spending and january s chicago pmi also influenced in december the annual rate of inflation held steady at 1 6 sitting well short of the fed s 2 objective while personal spending continued to deliver up by 0 3 manufacturing sector activity in chicago weighed heavily the chicago pmi slumped from 48 2 to 42 9 in january housing sector figures trade data and finalized consumer sentiment numbers had a muted impact in the week while the stats influenced it was also the fed s first policy decision of the year which left rates unchanged fed chair powell raised concerns over the possible effect of the coronavirus on china and the global economy however with market jitters already leading to a flattening in the 3 month 10 year yield curve on tuesday powell s comments led to inversion on wednesday on friday the yield on 3 month treasuries stood at 1 54 with the yields on 10 year down at 1 51 in the equity markets the dow fell by 2 53 with the s p500 and nasdaq falling by 2 12 and by 1 76 respectively out of the uk it was a particularly quiet week on the economic calendar there were no material stats out of the uk to rock the pound the lack of stats left the pound under pressure with market risk aversion weighing on the pound ahead of thursday s boe monetary policy decision while expectations were for the boe to stand pat on policy forward guidance was key better than expected private sector pmi and employment figures did the trick in the week prior the vote count in favor of a rate cut delivered the upside for the pound in the week the markets had priced in a 3rd vote in favor of a rate cut just 2 members of the mpc voted in favor of a cut driving the pound back into positive territory not even britain s last day in the eu could pin back the pound the pound ended the week up by 1 02 to 1 3206 the ftse100 slid by 3 95 with negative sentiment towards the coronavirus and a stronger pound weighing out of the eurozone it was a busy week on the economic data front through the 1st half of the week economic data focused on germany disappointing ifo business climate index figures weighed on the eur at the start of the week while sentiment towards current conditions improved negative sentiment towards the economic outlook weighed on wednesday the markets brushed aside consumer confidence figures with coronavirus news in focus in the 2nd half of the week german and eurozone unemployment figures provided much needed support on friday however the stats failed to impress the eurozone economy saw growth slow from 0 2 to 0 1 in the 4th quarter year on year the economy grew by 1 0 slowing from 1 2 in the 3rd quarter retail sales figures from the end of the year also failed to impress german retail sales slumped by 3 3 reversing a 1 6 rise in november french consumer spending fell by 0 3 with the ecb reliant upon consumer spending to support growth it was a bad day on the data front the slide in consumer spending and weaker gdp numbers were joined with softer inflation figures for the week the eur rose by 0 62 to 1 1093 even negatively skewed numbers were not enough to offset the fed chair s cautious tone from wednesday and some weak numbers out of the u s for the eur lagarde had prepared the markets for some disappointment at last week s ecb press conference for the european major indexes it was a bearish week the dax30 led the way tumbling by 4 38 with the cac40 and eurostoxx600 down by 3 62 and by 3 05 respectively elsewhere it was a particularly bearish week for the aussie dollar and kiwi dollar for the week the aussie dollar slid by 2 05 to 0 6692 with the kiwi dollar tumbling by 2 16 to 0 6464 for the aussie dollar it was a relatively busy week for the aussie dollar with stats doing little to provide support business confidence waned in december as had been anticipated which was aussie dollar negative and raised pressure on the rba to make a move 4th quarter inflation figures on wednesday came in ahead of forecasts but the upside was not enough to prevent a near term rate cut by the rba in the 4th quarter the annual rate of inflation came in at 1 8 while finding early support on the day the aussie dollar slipped back into the red with the effects of the coronavirus on the chinese economy and the bush fires in australia being 2 major negatives for the aussie in the second half of the week 4th quarter wholesale inflation figures were aussie dollar negative on friday while in line with forecasts the annual rate of wholesale inflation eased from 1 6 to 1 4 providing further support for a rate cut for the kiwi dollar economic data in the week was limited to december trade figures while the numbers were on the positive side negative sentiment towards the coronavirus weighed the prospect of an extended period of economic disruption in china was kiwi dollar negative december s trade data revealed new zealand s increased reliance on china exports to china accounted for 28 of total exports in december a likely material slide in demand stemming from china s shut down over the coronavirus doesn t bode well expectations had been for the rbnz to stand pat on monetary policy should we see the spread extend through the rest of the quarter expect a material impact on growth for the loonie after a dovish bank of canada the markets had to wait until the end of the week for direction economic data included november gdp numbers and december s rmpi figures month on month the economy grew by 0 1 in november with the rmpi jumping by 2 8 in december that gives some breathing space to the boc though next week s stats will need to provide support the numbers provided little support however concerns over the impact of the coronavirus on the chinese economy and demand for crude weighed in the week the loonie ended the week down by 0 72 to c 1 3237 against the greenback for the japanese yen there were no material stats until a relatively busy friday through the week market risk sentiment towards the coronavirus provided support for the safe havens and the yen in particular the continued spread of the virus and rise in the death toll in the week came in spite of governments making efforts to stop the spread china s outlook for growth and domestic consumption looks dire as entire cities remain in lockdown with no immediate end in sight and the who raising the international status to a global emergency the shutdown could drag on a slide in demand from china would force central banks into action which will make the markets all the more sensitive to economic indicators in the coming weeks the boj may have to finally make a move stats on friday were skewed to the negative with inflationary pressures easing and retail sales sliding the only positive was a pickup in industrial production though this may be temporary the japanese yen rose by 0 85 to 108 35 against the u s dollar for the week out of china the markets were closed for the week with the government forced to extend the cny holiday market sentiment towards the coronavirus was the key driver in the week while the chinese government did its best to contain the virus the spread continued weighing on risk appetite at the end of the week the markets brushed aside mixed private sector pmi numbers the concern is now over the remainder of the 1st quarter and not the start

freedom and hope view s and so another independence day negotiates the corner next week sri lanka celebrates the 72nd anniversary of the ceylon independence act that was passed in the british parliament setting the people of this country free after 450 years of foreign rule to determine their own future their own destiny and their place in the comity of nations of the world is there much to celebrate despite the criticism and some nostalgically yearning for the past the countryâ s positives are many for one president gotabaya rajapaksa taking the salute on february 4 at independence square in colombo built at the site of an old royal air force hanger to commemorate freedom is significant in that the former sri lanka army colonel who will be dressed in civilian attire is the second head of government of independent lanka who served in the military and then came to lead this nation through the democratic process â second to sir john kotelawela also a colonel in the ceylon defence force later made a general of the sri lanka army while on his deathbed by president j r jayewardene the flamboyant sir john was an anglophile with a house in kent uk but a patriot nevertheless the donor of the property that now houses the defence university bearing his name and whose motto is â siya ratamai kawadathâ for the motherland forever â president rajapaksa also temporarily took citizenship in the united states but his love for his motherland was never in question the point being that the two soldier politicians from yesteryear and the present made their way to lead the nation through the ballot and not the bullet and that the people of sri lanka have displayed their commitment to the democratic way of life with all its faults rejecting over the years two aborted military coup dâ ã tats and two armed insurgencies one home grown and one instigated from abroad sri lankaâ s democratic edifice has never collapsed given the declining standards of the countryâ s elected representatives and legitimate questions on the fallibility of the â one man one voteâ universal adult franchise sri lankans have nevertheless kept their faith in the â noise and chaosâ of democracy rather than be tempted to fall prey to other forms of government to which many newly independent post colonial nations in asia africa and latin america fell victim in all this it was the armed forces that came to the rescue of democracy in sri lanka at its most perilous times as they parade next tuesday it is the nation that must salute them and it is by this strange quirk of fate that these same armed forces are getting roasted in international fora by the very democracies of the world for doing what they did in defending the democratic way of life in sri lanka the nagging question of how free is sri lanka as we celebrate 72 years of independence however persists this question arises in the backdrop of the twin issues of getting the â monkey off the backâ insofar as the unhrc resolution is concerned and the entrapment by way of the foreign debt crisis to which sri lankan leaders past and present walked into â more than 80 percent of government revenue goes to service loans both local and foreign â the country and its cash strapped treasury are at a virtual standstill with all mega development projects suspended for the time being sri lanka has got sucked into many mega projects by foreign agencies especially by the chinese offering unsolicited proposals that have left the country unable to pay back in cash and instead offering its real estate compromising even the countryâ s territorial integrity in the process this has sent off alarm bells in neighbouring india which wants a similar foothold to offset chinese influence over the country and the us offering bait in the form of a congress approved grant so that it too is not left behind history is replete after all with us congress approved funds for covert cia operations around the world during the cold war and thereafter but sri lankaâ s economic dependency is such that it just cannot afford to kick a gift horse in the mouth so easily that is the predicament the country is in the ongoing impeachment proceedings against the us president deftly shows how the us president can strong arm a foreign country like ukraine so dependent on foreign aid like sri lanka to fight an adversary in russia to do his bidding â and for a whole bunch of us congressmen to argue that it is perfectly in order for an american president to do so western powers talk of free trade but use trade and economic sanctions as â weapons of warâ to browbeat economically dependent countries using preferential gsps and the like to tow their line when a country is economically weak come the predators hovering like vultures to grab a piece of the pie they feel they can still run countries like sri lanka that has got itself into a state of economic dependency and then start preaching human rights devolution reconciliation even the death penalty and lgbt rights when their own homes are anything but in perfect order in the charged and extremely nuanced world order an independent sri lanka must not just survive but thrive there is therefore a greater need to lay emphasis on keeping abreast of unfolding events around the world the strategic studies institute must be upgraded and put to better use to research monitor and recommend to the countryâ s decision makers options on how to deal with current trends specific to sri lanka the country will then be better prepared than it is today where ad hocism and short term objectives often having long term consequences seem the order of the day whichever government is in office sri lanka was a success story at the time of independence universal adult franchise free education and a good health care system in place and then came even free rice but the well meaning welfare state the politicians wanted for the people could not sustain itself somebody had to pay the bill what followed was galloping inflation ethnic issues unemployment giant loss making state corporations bribery corruption and to hell with a meritocracy the sri lankan exchequer relies heavily on the seven billion us dollars remitted by its citizens working abroad especially in west asia it is not a matter to be proud of for a country that prides itself on its great civilisation and the stateâ s contribution towards these workers is paltry it is a subject that must come under the president or the minister of finance as we stated in our editorial this time last year â thereâ s no doubt that the country has not lived up to the bright expectations with which it woke to the dawn of independence on february 4 1948 â but thereâ s always hope and despite the naysayers the countryâ s positives are many that hope will be fulfilled only when the political leadership of this country stops thinking of one party and instead looks to â one nationâ we can say that again

thank you for joining us to discuss the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2019 after our remarks we will open up the call for questions reflecting on the year we generated record revenues and earnings and completed a number of strategic actions 2019 was a year of growth and transformation it s very fitting that 2020 marks the firms 125th anniversary our history is one filled with growth and change the most recent being our new name piper sandler companies our dedication to serving the best interests of clients employees shareholders and the communities where we live and work has been the foundation of our success i m excited to celebrate our 125th anniversary with clients and colleagues while executing on our future strategic priorities let me begin by providing a summary of the strategic activities that shaped 2019 and our goals for 2020 and beyond in early august we closed on the acquisition of weeden company which significantly enhances the scale of our equity brokerage business by upgrading our trading capabilities and broadening our client base in late september we closed on the sale of advisory research our traditional asset management business this business no longer fit with our strategic vision and the sale was the best course of action for our clients employees and shareholders finally early in july we announced the acquisition of sandler o neill the acquisition closed on january 3 of this year sandler adds the leading investment banking firm focused on the financial services industry to our growing investment banking platform i look forward to working with jon doyle and jimmy dunne and the fantastic team they lead in 2020 we look to build on the record financial results achieved in 2019 with sandler successfully closed we now look forward to providing clients access to the full breadth of our combined capabilities both weeden and sandler were market leaders who chose to partner with us part of our continued growth will include selectively adding partners who share our client centric culture and who can leverage the piper sandler platform to better serve clients development and retention of our own talent provides the most profitable growth and we continue to invest in the development of our future leaders next let me provide some overall comments on our financial results for 2019 and an update on our advisory and equity capital markets businesses in q4 we generated 276 million of adjusted net revenues and 2 89 of eps both quarterly records our strong finish to the year led to adjusted revenues of 824 million for 2019 and eps of 7 36 also records turning now to advisory services advisory generated quarterly revenues of 144 million up 35 from q3 and 12 from the year ago quarter q4 advisory revenues were led by our market leading healthcare franchise with strong contributions from consumer technology and industrials for the year advisory revenues were 441 million up 12 reflecting strong broad based performance our healthcare consumer and industrial teams all performed well generating record or near record results we advised on 178 transactions during the year up from 170 in 2018 we continue to focus on elevating our platform by leveraging our brand to win larger deals and enhancing our value proposition to clients by providing more products and deep sector expertise this is reflected in our median fee increasing 16 from a year ago driving increased revenues growing and broadening advisory services has been a long standing focus for us our revenues have more than doubled in the last five years reflecting strong market share gains these results are a function of internal development selective hiring and corporate development activities we ve previously discussed remixing the business toward capital light variable cost businesses such as advisory for the third year in a row advisory revenues represented over 50 of our total revenues a trend we expect will continue we re excited to add sandler to our platform a market leader in the financial services industry sandler is also an advisory led franchise with approximately 50 of revenues generated by advisory services the combination significantly elevates our advisory practice with market leadership in healthcare financial services consumer and energy and we expect to be in the top 3 of all u s investment banks in terms of deal flow trade tensions geopolitical risks and the u s presidential election create headline risk for 2020 however conditions for m a in the middle market remain conducive to transactions due to demand from pe investors attractive valuations low financing rates and continued solid economic growth our pipeline is really strong across our industry verticals albeit back half weighted again as we reload from the strong q4 turning to ecm equity financing activity finished the year very strong with q4 revenues of 43 million driven by our healthcare team for the quarter we raised 3 9 billion in capital for our clients and we re bookrunner on 76 of transactions for the full year we generated 105 million in equity financing revenues down 14 from 2018 reflecting challenges in the cyclical energy sector and the impact of the federal government shutdown in early 2019 looking forward to 2020 the combination with sandler adds a market leading franchise to our capital markets offerings and expands our platform as financial services represents a large and broad fee pool from a corporate capital raising perspective we previously set a long term goal of growing annual advisory and corporate financing revenues to 750 million with the addition of sandler we should be close to achieving that goal we see continued growth over the medium term by adding talent in certain sub sectors to broaden our industry teams and continuing to increase banker productivity we also see an opportunity to capitalize on the strength of our u s franchises by expanding in europe as a result our new goal is to grow advisory and corporate financing to over 1 billion of combined annual revenues over the next several years i will now turn the call over to deb to discuss our public finance and brokerage businesses deb schoneman managing director president thanks chad let me begin with an update on our equity brokerage business equity markets in the fourth quarter saw low volatility and volumes there were few catalysts motivating clients to trade as markets continue to advance higher despite global growth concerns and trade tensions our equity brokerage business generated revenues of 32 million for the quarter and 89 million for the year up meaningfully compared to the prior period driven by the addition of weeden to our platform on an annual basis inclusive of sandler we expect equity brokerage revenues to be approximately 130 million providing meaningful operating leverage in the business as we capitalize on cost synergies with a comprehensive suite of products one of the largest client base with the domestically focused brokers and a high quality research franchise covering 875 stocks we believe that we have a significant market share opportunity in front of us as participants consolidate toward larger broader and higher quality providers turning to our public finance business debt financing finished the year very strong with 31 million of revenues for the fourth quarter up 37 from q3 and 13 from a year ago we benefited from a surge of new issuance volume in the market as clients took advantage of low rates in addition we completed several higher spread financings as demand remained strong for high yield muni offerings in this lower interest rate environment for the full year we generated 86 million of debt financing revenues up 17 from a slow 2018 market conditions significantly improved as the year progressed driven by low rates and investor demand increased issuance for 2019 was driven by a pickup in refunding activity especially taxable refinancings and an increase in new money issuance we expect the debt financing momentum we experienced in 2019 to carry over into 2020 with another strong year of market issuance our pipeline is solid with several higher spread financings in the backlog as always our ability to execute on our backlog is contingent on market conditions investors value the tax exempt feature of municipals and differentiated high credit quality of this asset class making it a valuable component of our product capabilities our commitment and expertise in the public finance market has led to increasing market share over time and makes us a natural destination for talent looking to best serve their clients in 2019 we added nine senior bankers expanding our presence in nebraska colorado pennsylvania and ohio we are one of the most active municipal debt underwriters in the market ranking in the top 10 based on par value and top 3 based on volume of deals in the fixed income markets yields normalized in the fourth quarter as the yield curve steepened easing concerns about an inverted curve the 0 2 spread expanded from 5 basis points at september 30 to 34 basis points at year end for the quarter we generated fixed income brokerage revenues of 25 million consistent with q3 and up 73 over the very challenging year ago period for the full year we produced 95 million of revenues a 40 increase from 2018 a combination of conducive market conditions increase in client activity and strong execution drove a very successful year for our fixed income franchise it s important to note we achieved these results in a lower risk profile and with a reduced headcount and cost base driving a meaningful increase in the returns for this business looking to 2020 we re excited by the opportunities the combination with sandler presents given the complementary products and expertise now i will turn the call over to tim to review our financial results and provide an update on capital use tim carter managing director chief financial officer thanks deb my comments will be focused on our adjusted non gaap financial results however let me first highlight a few items impacting our gaap results our gaap results include amounts related to the discontinued operations of advisory research our traditional asset management business for the year we recorded net income from discontinued operations of 23 8 million or 1 65 per diluted common share which included a gain on the sale of this business in addition we incurred restructuring and integration costs of 1 8 million in q4 and 14 3 million for the full year related to the acquisitions of sandler and weeden these costs consisted of severance benefits contract termination costs and transaction related professional fees we expect to incur additional restructuring and integration costs in the first half of 2020 associated with the sandler acquisition turning to our adjusted financial results we achieved record revenues of 276 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 and 824 million for the full year our q4 revenues increased 36 sequentially with strong performances across investment banking but especially in equity capital markets which finished the year very strong with 43 million of revenues the highest quarterly level in over a decade compared to the year ago period quarterly revenues were up 29 with increases across all of our business lines for the year revenues increased 12 driven by growth in advisory services and an increase in fixed income brokerage revenues which rebounded 40 from the depressed 2018 levels we produced an operating margin of 20 4 for the fourth quarter generating pre tax profits of 56 million and diluted eps of 2 89 illustrating the operating leverage in the business at higher revenue levels for the year pre tax profits were 136 million an increase of 26 from 2018 by maintaining cost discipline we were able to grow profits at twice the rate of revenues this drove a 16 6 operating margin for the year a meaningful expansion from 14 7 in 2018 on a year to date basis eps was 7 36 an increase of 29 from 2018 driven by higher revenues and a higher operating margin turning to operating expenses our compensation ratio of 61 2 for the quarter was below our target range of 62 to 63 robust revenues in the quarter enabled us to leverage fixed compensation costs in the business for the full year our comp ratio was 62 at the low end of our stated range given our focus on corporate development activities in 2019 we did fewer senior investment banking hires which drove our comp ratio to the lower end of the range quarterly non comp expenses of 51 million were elevated due to increased deal related expenses driven by higher investment banking revenues for the year non comp expenses were 176 million although non comps averaged 44 million per quarter they trended higher in the second half of the year given the addition of weeden to our platform we continue to carefully manage non comp expenses as these costs are an important source of operating leverage our adjusted tax rate was 26 3 for the quarter and 22 1 for the full year the lower annual tax rate was a result of a 5 1 million tax benefit from restricted stock awards vesting at values greater than the grant price excluding this tax benefit our adjusted tax rate was 25 9 for the year over the past few years we have recorded a tax benefit resulting from restricted stock awards vesting at values greater than their grant date price however this is dependent on the share price at vesting relative to the grant date price and can result in either a tax benefit or additional tax expense for 2020 we do not expect to generate a tax benefit at the same levels as the past few years at our current share price we re projecting no tax benefit related to the awards vesting in the first quarter of 2020 also given the recent changes to our business related to corporate development and strategic activities we expect our tax rate in 2020 to increase as such we are updating our full year estimated tax rate guidance to a range of 26 to 28 turning to capital our goal is to maximize shareholder value this includes maintaining our dividend policy of returning 30 to 50 of non gaap earnings to our shareholders repurchasing shares on an opportunistic basis and to offset the dilution from stock vestings and deploying capital toward high quality acquisitions to accelerate growth in the business our relative weighting toward each of these levers is dependent on a number of factors including the market environment and our performance in the near term we are more biased toward investing in the business in regards to dividends the board approved a special cash dividend of 0 75 per share to be paid alongside the first quarter dividend when combined with the 1 50 of regular quarterly dividends total dividends for fiscal 2019 will be 2 25 per share this represents approximately 33 of our adjusted net income for 2019 the board also approved a quarterly dividend of 0 375 per share to be paid on march 13 2020 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on march 2nd 2020 in 2019 we repurchased 50 6 million or 702 000 shares of common stock at an average price of 72 09 per share in total we returned 86 million to shareholders in 2019 through dividends and share repurchases these amounts are in addition to deploying capital toward the sandler and weeden acquisitions we entered 2020 in a strong capital position with only a modest level of debt on the balance sheet we maintained the financial flexibility to continue returning capital to shareholders while investing in the business let me finish by reiterating some of the high level guidance we provided in q3 regarding our go forward operations with a full year of both weeden and sandler in our results we continue to project that sander will add approximately 300 million of revenues in 2020 going forward we expect our compensation ratio to be consistent with current levels in the range of 62 to 63 this level gives us the flexibility to continue investing in the business non comps may vary from period to period depending on the amount of deal related expenses we re adjusting our non compensation guidance to exclude the more variable deal related expenses in 2020 we estimate non comp expenses excluding deal related expenses to range from 53 million to 57 million per quarter we have revised this range to include office space consolidation costs in 2020 these office moves will generate savings in future periods and will allow us to integrate the teams across platforms and drive more connectivity and synergy among our employee partners in regards to deal related expenses these expenses should generally be viewed as a function of banking revenues based on historical experience we estimate that deal related expenses will represent approximately 3 5 to 4 of investment banking revenues before going to q a i d like to turn the call back to chad for a few additional comments chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer thanks tim let me close by thanking all my employee partners for their hard work and dedication and congratulating them on a record year and also welcoming our new employee partners from sandler the new piper sandler has an enviable market position and financial profile our market leadership sector expertise and broad product capabilities are unparalleled in the middle market with over 1 billion of annual revenues strong margins modest leverage and limited incremental operating capital needs we are nicely positioned to generate profits to further propel our growth and shareholder returns thanks and now let s open up the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you the floor is now open for questions our first question comes from the line of devin ryan of jmp securities devin ryan jmp securities analyst great good morning guys how are you chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer hi devin deb schoneman managing director president good morning devin ryan jmp securities analyst congratulations on the nice end of the year so first question just on the sandler deal so i know you re still expecting 300 million of revenue contribution at the moment and i m just curious how that number compares to what the actual kind of 2019 level was and it seems like business in the financial vertical starting on a pretty good note here so i m just trying to get some context on maybe some of the areas that might be lower relative to last year as it seems that that s the implication off of the 300 million and maybe you re leaving yourself some room for upside but just trying to think about the moving parts there chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer yes sure i can take that yeah sandler had another good year in 2019 we had disclosed in january the revenues from the last few years they had their third year in a row with revenues north of 300 million obviously that was the target we gave in july when we announced the deal we still feel very comfortable with the guidance that we expect it will add 300 million of revenues relative to some of their business segments they had another strong advisory year and i would say like our business and others we ve seen on the street a really strong finish to fixed income as well and yes i think it s true they ve got a good backlog good pipeline i think like our business just looking at some of the announced deals and projected closing dates i think they like us will be more back half weighted than first half weighted but yeah we expect another strong year terrific thanks chad and maybe a follow up for tim on the capital commentary and appreciate the detail and it sounds like the philosophy is pretty consistent but clearly the business could be throwing off a lot of cash here and i m just trying to think about any additional capital needs of the business moving forward whether there be opportunities in fixed income with the combined franchises you spent more time thinking about opportunities there or more to do on the financing side i m just trying to think about any other areas within the business that could actually consume capital relative to maybe what you re running at previously tim carter managing director chief financial officer yeah sure devin i think you re right in terms of how we continue to think about it it s really consistent with what we ve talked about before i don t think that additional capital within the business changes really all that much with the sandler acquisition i think the capital we have deployed in the various businesses i think remains fairly going forward i think we ve got some ability to leverage the combined platforms from that perspective but for us yeah it s going to continue to obviously return capital through the dividend which we very much expect to do and then look for other ways to invest in the business from a corporate development perspective and then continue to look opportunistically at share buybacks but that s probably the last priority here at least in the near term chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer yeah devin its chad i would just add we continue to be active and i think just given the growth of the platform continue to be shown interesting opportunities on the corporate development side clearly our integration with sandler has gone well i mean frankly the especially the integration on the investment banking side just given there was so little overlap that was pretty seamless and we re off to the races so i think it s unlikely we would do something large but very likely we ll continue to look at tuck in acquisitions or boutiques especially where there s very little overlap and it gives us some market leadership in some sub verticals devin ryan jmp securities analyst terrific and maybe just to end on that point so you highlighted the 1 billion plus advisory financing target it seems like you guys are you re well on the way there so maybe just kind of outline the path that you see to that and i believe that would be all organic and then to the extent there are kind of m a opportunities just maybe update us on some of those verticals that you feel like it would make more sense to buy versus build organically and even maybe to end on any other areas outside of investment banking that could be complementary inorganically to the business as you re thinking about kind of the overall corporate development chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer yeah i would take that for us i mean we like to have sort of these internal targets of where we think we re going to take the banking business and i just think back to 10 years ago when we had 150 million banking business we really felt we could drive that to 500 million we ve now had three years sort of in and around that range and as we ve said many times that came from about half organic and half corporate development i think a year ago we sort of set a new goal that we could do 750 million i think we thought that would take several years through smaller acquisitions and organic growth obviously we were very happy to partner with sandler and that probably launched us right to that 750 million mark and so now we ve just got this 1 billion target for financing and m a over the next few years and i would say that will be a combination of continued organic growth as we ve said in energy even in healthcare even in our strongest places there are sub verticals for organic growth we talked a lot about the opportunity to do more in fintech with the combination of our software platform and sandler s financial services platform but i think also in that goal would be some smaller boutiques smaller team lift outs like we talked about so i think it s a combination of those and then your last question is we d still be very open to opportunistic acquisitions or team lift outs in our public space and some of our specialty areas and then i would also just add we re the combination we re seeing some great early signs in fixed income obviously the integration in fixed income and equities is a little harder than banking since we are already in some of those businesses but i don t think it s out of the question that we could look to more corporate development and fixed income down the road as well devin ryan jmp securities analyst great thanks for all the color and taking all my questions chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer thanks devin deb schoneman managing director president thanks devin operator our next question comes from the line of chris walsh of wolfe research chris walsh wolfe research analyst hey guys good morning chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer hi chris tim carter managing director chief financial officer hey chris chris walsh wolfe research analyst congrats on the quarter chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer thank you chris walsh wolfe research analyst first one i just wanted to touch on was the ecm outlook you saw a big step up in 4q based on all the commentary from the universals that have already reported it seems like the outlook there is still fairly bullish and there might be clients that are trying to pull forward some of their equity raises in front of the u s election we re just looking for any color on what you re seeing among your client base chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer yes so i can take that we are definitely off to a better start this year in january admittedly we had a crazy low bar with the government shutdown last year but i would say we are seeing very much the same thing i think the first half will be quite active and i do think that there are people that are going to try to stay away from october and november with the election and if they were going to finance around that time they ll try to do it sooner but it s really hard to predict how that will impact the second half but i would agree generally we see pretty good climate here in the first half for ecm chris walsh wolfe research analyst and then just in terms of the sector mix i would assume that s fairly skewed toward healthcare would that be fair chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer yeah the entire sort of middle market fee pool in ecm has continued to concentrate even more in healthcare obviously we re really strong in healthcare so that s good for us but even our ecm results were impacted we did much less energy ecm last year than we did the year before so i actually expect we ll do a little better in some of the other sectors this year but the lion s share again will be healthcare and obviously we re really excited to add the financial services fee pool for ecm because that s a fairly large people chris walsh wolfe research analyst and then just one last one on the advisory business you said there are a higher number of transactions but also an increase in median fees which i think you said were up 16 over the course of 2019 it d be great if you could just comment on the underlying drivers there that have been driving your median fee rate higher chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer yeah so our median fee rate went up it s sometimes when you re looking at an average it can be driven by the bigger the bigger tickets obviously here we re talking about the median fee i would just say and this is true for our outperformance in q4 we had a couple of nice transactions slightly north of 10 million but the massive or the biggest part of our revenue stream really just came from fees 2 million to 5 million we just see more and more 3 million 4 million 5 million fees as our lots of our bankers are doing somewhat larger transactions so i think all of that has helped we still do plenty of 1 5 million fee so that s in the sweet spot of the middle market but we re definitely just seeing more 3s 4s and 5s on the advisory side chris walsh wolfe research analyst awesome thanks chad operator our next question comes from the line of michael brown of kbw michael brown kbw analyst hi good morning guys chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer hi deb schoneman managing director president good morning tim carter managing director chief financial officer hey mike michael brown kbw analyst so appreciate the color on sandler integration just kind of wondering are you seeing any material changes and how you re viewing some of the synergy potential across the platforms and then specifically on the expense side how far along is integration i understand it s been only a couple of weeks but is there still kind of more redundancies that need to be eliminated and kind of how should we think about how is that path will play out through 2020 chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer yeah i ll take the first stab at that obviously we look at synergies two ways what are the revenue opportunities and then on the expense side i think relative to the revenue opportunities obviously we haven t we re early days and we haven t sort of closed any of those transactions through cross referrals but we re definitely seeing across public finance and our various industry groups lots of collaboration lots of relationships and so we do still think in the long term we ll see some revenue pickup and as when we announced the deal in july relative to expenses this transaction sandler already ran very efficient operating margins and while there are some opportunities for cost synergies sort of as planned and we re still sort of tracking those the transaction was never about super huge cost synergies and there ll be things that go the other way we re actually looking now with some offices that we ve got an ability to consolidate more quickly so we may end up having some more double rents this year but we feel really really good about the combination how the early teams are working together ultimately over the long term we will get some more cost synergies but that wasn t the big driver here in the short term michael brown kbw analyst great thank you and then the 17 to 19 targeted operating margin you hit 16 6 this year can you just remind us kind of what s the timeline that you expect to kind of achieve that post the sandler integration tim carter managing director chief financial officer yeah mike you re right i mean we saw a pretty big expansion this year i think just there is a lot of leverage that can be in the business that levels as we look at it sort of going forward we may not get to that targeted level in 2020 partly based on some of the costs that we ve talked about chad mentioned sort of this occupancy piece that as we consolidate we ve got some additional costs in 2020 so it may not get to that level in the near term but there is a clear path to get to that level evidenced by sort of the leverage that you see in 2019 and obviously with the sandler acquisition coming in it drives earnings nicely and is sort of in line with what we plan from an overall earnings accretion perspective chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer and i would just add i mean when we announced that in july that was obviously based on sandler having really good margins some opportunity to get some minimal expense synergies so our target was in the first couple of years we could get to the bottom of that and it might take a couple more years to get to the top of that but we still very much believe on a combined basis we can get to the top of that range michael brown kbw analyst okay great thank you for the color on that and just one more for kind of modeling purposes as we think about the quarterly trajectory in 2020 heard you loud and clear on kind of the back half waiting for investment banking obviously with the integration of weeden the brokerage business certainly has a little bit of a different quarterly trajectory as well so any color there as to how you expect those revenues to flow through and then is there any other seasonality we need to make sure we consider in our modeling deb schoneman managing director president yeah maybe starting with equities as you were just speaking to with in one of the things as you probably know as we ve seen more cyclicality of that business historically as we paid for research more in the maybe second half of the year not perfectly clear what that will look like as we head into a new year with the combined platform but clearly having a stronger execution platform in a commission management business there it is likely we could see some less cyclicality but left to be played out and then maybe i would also just note on the public finance business is a business that historically has had pretty weak q1s over the last number of years and we re feeling good about the momentum we re seeing carrying over from q4 into q1 not necessarily at that same level but maybe more than we ve seen historically chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer yeah and i would just say yeah relative to the rest of the business i mean if you go back 15 years or 20 years usually four years out of the five years were stronger in the back half than the first half and that can be sometimes skewed based on some big transactions in q1 q2 we feel very good about our visibility in the pipeline and we re off to a good start but we re highly confident in the pipeline but really do think it will be the closures maybe not the announced deals but the closures will be and the revenue recognition will be more back half weighted michael brown kbw analyst thanks for taking my question deb schoneman managing director president thank you operator our next question comes from the line of mike grondahl of northland securities mike grondahl northland securities analyst hi yeah congratulations on the great year kind of transformational and also the strong fourth quarter chad you talk about a 122 investment banking mds what is a rough range to think about that maybe one year from now and two years from now what would you like to get that to as you make some tuck ins or contemplate some tuck ins chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer yeah no i think that s a good question i mean when we were kind of operating close to 90 mds on our own obviously with the combination about half of our financial services team joined the sandler platform plus you had their mds so that s sort of why we use the 122 mds that s sort of as of january 3 how many mds we had that number does not include our own organic promotion class which we will announce in march which is one of our larger classes so i sort of expect and hope we could end in the high 120s maybe close to 130 this year and yeah we sort of targeted to get to that 1 billion that s probably 150 md or 160 md number over the next three years four years five years and i would say probably that incremental 20 md will come through a combination of organic hires and team lift outs and internal development mike grondahl northland securities analyst got it that s helpful anything to call out i know you did a lot of planning with sandler before the close it s closed less than a month but anything that you re really delighted with so far or maybe even a little bit pleasantly surprised with chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer yeah i mean maybe i ll give you a couple of things i mean the sandler folks are super collaborative i think you can just tell from their culture of how they run the business the last 30 years everybody thinks about driving revenue across sort of silos or products it doesn t matter i mean they re all sort of sharing our relationships already bringing us ideas and different verticals so i m very optimistic about that and i would just say if there is sort of a little extra giddy up in our step it s just the opportunity in fixed income we re seeing some very cool things across the combination of our two platforms that it s going to take a while for us to see major upside on that revenue but some of the stories are quite fun mike grondahl northland securities analyst and just lastly on the fixed income side is it more clients cross sell product maybe just detail that a little bit more for us on fixed income deb schoneman managing director president yeah fixed income from a client perspective we really saw minimal overlap unlike maybe the equity side of business as you think about bringing in both sandler and weeden so it s really more i would say in a combination of product and analytics and expertise and on both sides both sandler and piper historically had different expertise in different products call it in sa municipals and some other taxable product on our side and things like loan trading and derivatives products and things that are more unique that in both cases we can leverage that across our broader client platform mike grondahl northland securities analyst got it great and hey good luck in 2020 deb schoneman managing director president thanks mike chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer thanks mike operator and that was our final question i d like to turn the floor back over to chad abraham for any additional or closing remarks chad abraham chairman and chief executive officer okay thanks operator we look forward to updating you again in april and hope everybody has a great day thank you very much operator duration 44 minutes call participants chad abraham

keith mestrich president and chief executive officer thank you drew and good morning everyone we appreciate your time and attention today this morning i will discuss the high level results for the fourth quarter and provide an update on our strategy to grow the bank before turning the call back over to drew to discuss our financial results in more detail to start there are six key highlights of the fourth quarter and the full year of 2019 that i would like to focus on today first i am thrilled with the performance of the entire amalgamated team in achieving the best financial results in a 97 year history of this great institution and propelling the bank past the 5 billion asset mark in 2019 i m also very happy with our quarterly and full year earnings which show the earnings potential of the bank going forward these are historic achievements and have motivated our entire organization to do even more in the coming year second i m thrilled with the success that our team achieved in growing our loan portfolio in 2019 i would note that we made the decision in the fourth quarter to move our pace assets to securities given their structure but no change has been made to the assets that we hold as a result we delivered 7 annual loan growth on top of the addition of 264 million in pace assets taken together our portfolio grew 15 for the full year 2019 which exceeded our expectations especially when you consider the substantial runoff that we achieved in our indirect c i portfolio as we continued to derisk our balance sheet amalgamated s mission and values remain a critical differentiator in the market and have positioned us for growth in the sustainable lending sector which was the key driver to our success in this past year more importantly we are poised for continued growth as we enter 2020 third our deposit franchise has again proved to be a competitive advantage that amalgamated enjoys as we continue to experience healthy growth through the fourth quarter and full year of 2019 this success was broad based having achieved strong political deposit growth and expansion in our core relationships in the nonprofit labor and philanthropic sectors the percentage of noninterest bearing deposits expanded nicely in the quarter and the full year and our cost of fund positioning remains a long term strategic differentiator for us fourth our noninterest expense was slightly elevated in the quarter primarily associated with sox readiness and we started to invest in new business initiatives in the trust department which represent exciting growth opportunities for the bank that we expect to accelerate in 2020 given the opportunity that we see ahead we will discuss these initiatives in more detail in a moment fifth credit remains very stable with the exception of one previously modified indirect c i credit that we moved to nonaccrual over the course of 2019 we reduced the indirect c i portfolio by approximately 177 million and only 60 million remains in the portfolio and lastly we continue to work hard every day to build upon our reputation as america s socially responsible bank and are proud to announce our recent esg accomplishments this quarter including the launch of our cross departmental corporate social responsibility committee with board oversight making additional esg related disclosures and continued support of policy advocacy efforts that help build a more inclusive and sustainable world we believe that our long term positioning as a socially responsible company and a solid esg investment will be especially important in this era where more and more consumers are demanding that the companies they do business with hold themselves accountable to a broad set of stakeholders turning to the quarter we witnessed nice growth in our residential portfolio as well as continued strengthening of our position in the renewable energy and energy efficiency space towards the end of the quarter we added approximately 177 5 million in pace assessments a category that we like for its mission alignment its relatively favorable returns and the credit strength of the assets in the portfolio we have provided more details on these assets on slide 9 of the presentation we also saw additional activity in commercial solar and commercial pace again categories of assets that we like for their returns and safety as well as mission alignment with our overall business positioning as america s most socially responsible bank we are also pleased to announce that post our acquisition of new resource bank we doubled our commitment to impact lending and investing to 700 million this initiative a two year goal was achieved this past december delivering upon our goal eight months ahead of schedule our unique deposit franchise continues to deliver achieving 29 5 annualized growth during the quarter and 13 for the full year or 23 after adjusting for the 327 million of short term deposits at year end 2018 at quarter end our political deposits totaled 578 6 million which is a record high for amalgamated i am particularly encouraged by the strength of our brand and the success that our bankers have achieved over the course of 2019 as we continued to take share in the political deposit market as we greatly expanded our share of both political candidates and major party committees in order to further expand our franchise we hired an experienced political banker in our san francisco office in the fourth quarter who has made very good progress expanding our reach in california where we have an opportunity to grow our presence beyond our political deposit franchise we also experienced broad based deposit growth in our other key verticals we brought in new labor relationships in our western region office and hired a banker this month to focus on our union relationships in the west we also saw a nice increase in our lending to labor unions in our northeast region and opened new relationships with major unions in our mid atlantic region our nonprofit banking team has grown and they had an excellent year in 2019 adding new relationships with environmental organizations lgbtq groups women s organizations and community development groups we hired a lender to focus on building relationships with the cdfi community and toward the end of the year we saw those relationships starting to bear fruit and 2019 was the year we really began to solidify our presence with philanthropies adding robust cash management relationships through innovative lending partnerships and we are well poised to discuss investment management opportunities with their endowment managers in the future looking ahead to 2020 our deposit pipeline is strong and all of our teams in all three regions are off to a strong start as we announced on our last call we plan to open commercial offices later this year in boston and los angeles and i expect to see us adding new relationships in those markets as well our deposit cost of funds held relatively steady at 36 basis points in the fourth quarter down one basis point from the third quarter of 2019 and up 11 basis points from the year ago quarter looking forward we would expect our political deposits to remain relatively stable before declining toward the latter part of the third quarter as campaign funds get spent through the election if the past is prologue and i fully expect it to be the funding cycle seen in previous elections should repeat itself and campaign fundraising will begin again in earnest in the first and second quarters of 2021 our noninterest expense for the quarter was 33 5 million an increase of 1 6 million from the linked quarter primarily as a result of noncore expenses consisting of 1 1 million related to the acceleration of expenses associated with the closing of two branches in new york city in 2020 and the previously mentioned costs related to sox and our trust department work of note our trust study is an example of the investment spending that we are undertaking to expand the growth potential of the bank we believe that we have the opportunity to grow our trust business and have been exploring ways to more effectively deliver the investment management funds that are currently on our platform and to expand our offerings during the quarter we announced our agreement with invesco to become a sub advisor for our investment management business this relationship is based on our mission to expand opportunities for socially responsible investments given invesco s leadership in providing esg and mission focused products we believe our clients will benefit from the breadth and depth of invesco s passive equity fixed income and alternative investment capabilities we are coupling this expanded investment capability with a serious commitment to improving the delivery of our core custody offering i am personally very focused on the transformation of our trust business as i believe the value of our franchise can be greatly enhanced through a vibrant set of investment and custody offerings that can increase the bank s noninterest income something that i think is extremely important in the current and perhaps prolonged low interest environment looking to the year ahead we also see an opportunity to expand our geographic reach as well as our product offerings given the large market opportunity that we see amalgamated continues to be the banking partner of choice for individuals and companies who share our strong values and mission and we continue to estimate that there is a 90 billion commercial deposit opportunity in the united states to tap into this large market and as i referenced earlier we continue to move forward with our strategy to open commercial banking offices in boston and los angeles in 2020 we are currently recruiting bankers and securing commercial office space as we will not be opening branches to support this effort we will also continue to return capital to shareholders and are pleased with our board s approval of a 33 increase in our quarterly dividend to 0 08 per share importantly we will maintain a disciplined capital allocation strategy as we remain focused on maximizing value for our shareholders to conclude we are entering 2020 very well positioned for the future i am pleased with the progress that our team has achieved and the strides we have made to prudently grow our franchise this past year additionally 2019 proved to be a year where our reputation as america s socially responsible bank started to become more widely recognized in the market as we were recognized with several notable awards including euromoney s best bank for corporate social responsibility in north america and forbes best bank in california i m very excited with the year ahead given the many opportunities that i see and i would like to thank all of our employees for their hard work now i d like to turn the call over to drew for a more detailed review of our financial results drew labenne chief financial officer thank you keith i will begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year results before turning the line back to the operator to open for questions turning to slide 6 in the fourth quarter deposits increased 318 6 million or 29 5 annualized to 4 6 billion from the third quarter of 2019 while average deposits for the quarter were 4 4 billion as expected average noninterest bearing deposits increased 87 6 million from the prior quarter primarily due to seasonality related to the election cycle and now represent 46 of average deposits at year end our deposit cost of funds held relatively steady at 36 basis points deposits from politically active customers such as campaigns pacs and state and national party committees increased 67 7 million from 510 9 million at september 30 2019 ending the year at 578 6 million as outlined on slide 7 the election environment continues to be a source of growth for our deposit franchise the focus for the year ahead will be the presidential race and as keith mentioned we haven t continued to be a partner supporting the business needs of the majority of democratic candidates as seen on slide 8 we delivered annual loan growth of 228 1 million or 7 1 as compared to december 31 2018 and ended the year with 3 4 billion of total loans this loan growth was achieved while following through on our diligent efforts to run off our indirect c i portfolio additionally as keith mentioned we increased our balance of pace assessments which are now reported in the held to maturity securities portfolio to 263 8 million which is inclusive of approximately 171 million in purchase residential pace assessments this quarter looking forward we continue to like the yield and credit profile of the pace assets and see this as an important driver to our portfolio growth in 2020 and beyond the yield on average earning assets was 3 81 for the fourth quarter a decrease of 14 basis points as compared to the same period in 2018 driven by lower market rates on loans and securities the yield on our total loans was 4 10 compared to 4 22 in the third quarter of 2019 due to lower market rates on new loan originations and the impact of lower fed funds rate turning to slide 10 our net interest margin was 3 43 for the quarter a decrease of seven basis points from the third quarter and a year over year decrease of 14 basis points the decrease compared to the linked quarter was primarily due to the decrease in yield on interest earning assets fourth quarter nim includes five basis points of accretion of the loan marked from the nrb acquisition net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 42 3 million which compares to 41 8 million in the linked quarter and approximately 2 0 million increase as compared to 40 2 million in the same quarter of 2018 for the year net interest income was 166 7 million which compares to 149 7 million in the year prior now on to noninterest income noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 7 8 million increasing slightly from 7 7 million in the third quarter of 2019 and a 221 000 increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 noninterest income for the full year was 29 2 million an increase of 3 1 compared to 2018 keith has already hit on many of the drivers for our expense increase in the fourth quarter for the full year 2019 our noninterest expense remained relatively flat at 127 8 million a decrease of 177 000 or 0 1 from the 128 million for the year ended december 31 2018 the slight decrease was primarily due to increases in compensation and benefit costs of 2 9 million some of which was for temporary workers for special projects occupancy and depreciation also increased 0 7 million due to scheduled branch closures in 2020 the increases were offset by a decrease of 1 8 million in professional fees associated with the ipo and nrb acquisition in 2018 there was also 1 6 million of decrease in other expenses associated with lower fdic expense and release of off balance sheet provision as we head into 2020 we will continue a moderate level of strategic investment in the trust business and the expansion into boston and los angeles additionally there are always some inflationary pressures on normal expenses these increases will mostly be offset by the savings we have secured in 2019 and the two branch closures in early 2020 we estimate the branch closures will average run rate expense savings of approximately 2 million annually we forecast our core expenses to run at approximately 32 million per quarter in 2020 with some variation in the quarters skipping ahead to slide 14 the credit quality of our portfolio held steady throughout the fourth quarter as nonperforming assets totaled 66 7 million or 1 25 of period end total assets at december 31 2019 compared to 1 42 as of september 30 2019 a decrease of 4 9 million from the linked quarter and an increase of 7 4 million as compared to december 31 2018 criticized and classified loans decreased by approximately 9 million in the fourth quarter compared to the linked quarter the provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled an expense of 83 000 which compares to a recovery of 600 000 in the third quarter of 2019 the provision expense in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by an increase in specific reserves from our indirect c i portfolio due to one loan moving to nonaccrual partially offset by a release in allowance related to the movement of pace assessments to held to maturity securities skipping to slide 16 our gaap and core return on tangible average common equity were 9 7 and 10 7 respectively for the fourth quarter of 2019 the core return compares to 11 4 for the third quarter of 2019 and 9 5 for the comparable period in 2018 the modest decrease in core return on tangible equity in the linked quarter was primarily due to the previously discussed factors lastly we remain well capitalized to support future growth to conclude we are pleased with our 2019 results in terms of growing the business and positioning ourselves for increasing profitability turning to slide 17 we have outlined our expectations for 2020 this guidance assumes a year end 2019 yield curve with no change in the fed funds target for 2020 we are assuming pre tax pre provision earnings of 70 million to 78 million we re targeting 10 balance sheet growth we are targeting a core efficiency ratio of 64 or better thank you again for your time today we look forward to updating everyone on our first quarter results in april with that i d like to ask the operator to open up the line for any questions operator questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from alex twerdahl with piper sandler please proceed with your question alex twerdahl piper sandler analyst hey good morning guys just first question on the political deposits i appreciate your commentary and expecting those to kind of level off early in the year and then decline into the election which seems like it s pretty obvious but do you have a sense for one where do you think those might decline to as we approach the election and then two drew maybe you could remind us kind of what the implications on the margin would be when those deposits actually do flow out keith mestrich president and chief executive officer so sorry on the first question just what will the timing be on those deposit outflows or is that alex twerdahl piper sandler analyst yes and then maybe where you envision i mean after the fourth quarter of 18 that went down others we re not getting in the year keith mestrich president and chief executive officer yes absolutely so the timing if we just look back to the last cycle it was really at the very end of q3 and then the beginning of q4 where we saw that outflow happen so almost no impact on q3 i think this cycle may or may not be different just given the number of candidates that are out there and we re still very unclear on who s going to be the lead democratic candidate going into the election drew labenne chief financial officer yes i mean alex i think it s a great question it s a little hard to try and put a specific pin in it our money is not all money that s being raised for the current election cycle right there s six years kind of campaign money in there some of the campaign committees don t spend down to zero i think one of the important things to remember is we have adequate liquidity on the books to make sure that we can cover any runoff that there is but it will go down substantially several hundred million dollars and then it should start to build up again in the first and second quarters of 2021 but pretty hard to put a real specific pin on exactly where that number lands on the middle of november alex twerdahl piper sandler analyst ok i mean it doesn t really matter which democratic candidate winds up carrying the ticket right i mean a lot of this money is pac money and kind of not necessarily the money that s raised by the specific candidate am i correct in that thinking drew labenne chief financial officer that s right in fact the presidential election money is just a small portion of the overall dollars that are in the political dollars it s money that pacs and super pacs are raising it s money that other candidates are raising it s money that the political campaign committees like the dnc and others are raising so it s a variable base but again hard to put an exact pin on where it lands in mid november keith mestrich president and chief executive officer and then as far as the margin impact when it goes out our current plan is certainly subject to change as that will backfill the outflow with borrowings in the short term and then hopefully fill it back up with deposits both political and nonpolitical political as the cycle starts again in terms of fundraising alex twerdahl piper sandler analyst ok and then just in the guidance for full year net income and i appreciate the yield curve commentary but can you just remind us maybe how you re positioned from a nim standpoint and kind of how we should expect that nim to progress now that all the rate cuts are kind of factored into seemingly all the rates are kind of now on the table now and kind of how you expect your loans to reprice new loans coming on the books and deposit repricing keith mestrich president and chief executive officer yes i think that with the last cut there may still be a little bit of bleed in or lag effect from that last cut coming into the next quarter as far as assets coming on the books it will really depend on the mix but i can tell you resi multifamily those are all coming in kind of the low to mid 3s at this point in terms of the yields that are coming on the books so i think there s going to be pressure on asset yields as far as those asset categories and i think some of the other assets such as pace have higher yields and as much as we re able to and i m sure we ll talk about that more in a minute but assuming we can add more pace assets as well that will help to offset some of the pressure from those lower yielding assets coming on the books with our deposit cost in particular we had a 4 deposit beta cumulatively in the upcycle so in the downcycle we re not going to see a large amount of extensive repricing because it s not going to go up slow and come down fast so i think our repricing options on the deposit side while there are some are probably going to be more limited to some of the banks that had much higher betas in the uptrend of the cycle alex twerdahl piper sandler analyst ok so is that kind of a long way of saying that you expect the margin to be mostly stable maybe a little bit of downdrift early in 2020 just based on some additional bleed through from the last rate cuts keith mestrich president and chief executive officer i would say that there will be nim pressure going into 2020 let me just put it that way i think it will be more than a couple of basis points that we ll see going forward but you can see kind of how nim compression happened from q3 to q4 that obviously had rate cuts in it but i think we will have some nim compression going into next year as well alex twerdahl piper sandler analyst thanks for taking my questions keith mestrich president and chief executive officer thanks alex operator thank you our next question is coming from the line of brian morton with barclays please proceed with your question brian morton barclays analyst good morning guys yeah i was hoping maybe to get a little bit more detail on your 2020 guidance and kind of what are the factors that could drive us to the high end of the guidance and then conversely what could drive us to the low end drew labenne chief financial officer well i think balance sheet growth and we ve obviously put a 10 target out there for overall asset growth exceeding that asset growth i think could be one of the levers obviously that would drive earnings higher fee income is another opportunity for us we are doing some work in our trust and asset management space where that could be a spot where we could grow at a faster pace than we expect just so i can get the comment in there we are still expecting runoff of that one fund from our trust department so there will be some downward pull from that fund as well but that s factored into our guidance already and then expenses i think we re always looking at expenses i think we ve taken a lot of actions this year we ll continue to look at what s possible in i m sorry in 2019 we took a lot of actions in 2020 this year we ll continue to look at what opportunities are out there as well keith mestrich president and chief executive officer yes and i would add too i think just the vibrancy of our deposit growth particularly in the noninterest bearing space has really allowed us to keep the small amount of borrowings that we keep on the books at a very very modest level and as long as that pipeline which is pretty robust right now stays robust that will help us even though we don t have as drew said a lot of downward levers that we can use in the fund pricing space the minimization of borrowings until we see the political runoff happen will be something that i think will really guide into the higher ranges of the guidance brian morton barclays analyst ok just one quick question did you repurchase any shares this quarter drew labenne chief financial officer not as much as last quarter we purchased a little over 100 000 shares which happened really at the beginning of the quarter and then the price moved up pretty rapidly and we were no longer in the market repurchasing brian morton barclays analyst all right and that totaled to how much in dollars you re saying drew labenne chief financial officer i think it was about a little under 2 million 1 5 million somewhere in that range brian morton barclays analyst ok great and then maybe my final question have you guys really looked into kind of the impact and timing of doing a cecl adoption keith mestrich president and chief executive officer well we know what a back end timing is obviously with 2023 part of our evaluation process is going to be looking at how smoothly cecl rolls out in q1 for all those banks who are adopting in this next quarter here so i think after we do that evaluation we ll think about our timing we re also talking to our investors as well and just trying to understand their thoughts on the timing brian morton barclays analyst ok great thanks keith mestrich president and chief executive officer thanks brian operator thank you our next question comes from chris o connell with kbw please proceed with your question chris o connell kbw analyst good morning keith mestrich president and chief executive officer hi chris drew labenne chief financial officer good morning chris chris o connell kbw analyst so i was hoping to drill down on some of the provision impact in this quarter do you have the exact impact of the pace reclassification on the provision and then alternatively the impact of the single c i loan moving to nonaccrual drew labenne chief financial officer yes absolutely so with pace i was waiting for a question so i could expand upon this a little bit we did determine and we re speaking with the various constituencies that we work with that the appropriate place to put the pace assets was in securities the space between loans and securities for an asset like this is somewhat gray because they are bonded assessments from various municipalities but they don t have cusips they don t freely trade in the market but after that evaluation we determined that moving them to the securities portfolio was appropriate as a result of that we released the allowance on the pace assets that we had on the balance sheet in q3 and that released 700 000 from our allowance related to those assets so it s important to note that for the securities we have now we do not have any provision against them we think they are very solid assets with very low ltvs or i guess assessment to values but there s no longer any provision against those keith mestrich president and chief executive officer before drew goes on and talks about the one c i loan let me just add a little extra commentary on the pace piece regardless if they re considered a security or a loan we think that we are very bullish on this asset class we like the yields we like the mission alignment that comes with it that has additional both reputational and public relations aspect that helps us build our deposit business as well we like the credit quality of the asset very very very much we like the efficiency with which we can put these assets on the books and the lack of servicing capacity that we have to have with them and to be very frank now the classification with them as a security and this was not the driving impact in any way but the fact that we have to set little or no allowance with them just makes them even better in our mind so securities loans we like the asset class we will continue to be bullish on them that s why we will talk more and more about asset growth as opposed to just loan growth because we think this is an important part of our strategy moving forward and frankly one that we don t have a ton of competition in right now so we feel like we ve got some expertise here this can actually be very very valuable to our franchise i m going to turn it back to drew to talk about the c i loan drew labenne chief financial officer yes so with regards to the indirect c i portfolio as a whole we re still just under 60 million in terms of the balances outstanding in that portfolio and we ve talked in the past about the three loans that had some issues in that portfolio this is one of those three loans which we downgraded to nonaccrual in the quarter we built 1 7 million in specific reserves on that loan one of the other loans actually started performing a little better and we released 0 5 million on that loan so net net between to 1 2 million in specific reserves on the indirect c i portfolio chris o connell kbw analyst got it great and then looking forward toward i guess excluding the indirect c i reserves where the actual reserve to loan will trend toward especially now that pace isn t really going to be a part of the provisioning going forward keith mestrich president and chief executive officer yes if everything stays as it is today the allowance to loans excluding specific reserves should generally trend downward right you re continuing to expand your lookback period if you have no adverse credit impacts happening then the general trend will be probably small improvements in the factors leading to a release and then we ll have the normal balance build on top of that but most of our growth has been lower factor loans that we put on the books chris o connell kbw analyst got it you said earlier i guess you know what the reserve to loan is excluding the indirect c i book right now drew labenne chief financial officer i didn t do that math let me get back to you on that i don t want to do it quick and get it wrong but i think the specifics are about 7 million sitting in the portfolio chris o connell kbw analyst got it and then in terms of the balance sheet growth the target of 10 for next year given the opportunities that you re seeing within the pace space and i think you mentioned partnership with columbia solar as well in the deck given the opportunities you re seeing there how do you see that coming in between loans versus securities growth keith mestrich president and chief executive officer yes i think it s more heavily weighted to loans and pace assessment than it is to securities we do have some level of securities growth in our forecast for next year as well but i think that is all subject to change in opportunities based on what we see available in the market and the relative risk adjusted returns of those assets at the given time chris o connell kbw analyst got it i kind of was including pace in the securities there i guess i kind of meant what s going to be coming into the actual loans on the balance sheet versus the pace and securities together as a whole drew labenne chief financial officer yes i think if you look at our balance sheet we will continue right adding loans both in the residential space both from an origination standpoint and a purchase perspective we ll continue adding loans in the multifamily space in new york that market continues to be under some pressure post rent reform regulation although we do have some pipeline and we are putting additional opportunities on the books and then in the c i bucket we will continue to see opportunities to do non pace oriented solar and renewable energy deals that would be traditional c i loans commercial solar installation and other things there is another sector we continue to be quite pleased with and seeing a lot of opportunities upcoming and in the last quarter and i referenced this in the beginning part of the thing we did hire a lender who is really focused in the community development space and we have opportunity in the affordable housing and working with other cdfi opportunities we have a nice pipeline of activities to do there those feel like very traditional c i loans so we re not just putting everything in the sort of new securities bucket if you will and just relying on pace we like that a lot but our lenders are very active in the renewable energy and community development space as well chris o connell kbw analyst great and just last one for me but do you have any idea on the timing of the two branch closures in this quarter keith mestrich president and chief executive officer yes they ve been announced both branches will close at the end of february i think actually literally the last day of february chris o connell kbw analyst great thanks for the time keith mestrich president and chief executive officer yeah thanks chris operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jp morgan please proceed with your question steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst hey good morning everyone keith mestrich president and chief executive officer hi steve steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst i wanted to first follow up on the nim commentary so if we look at loan yields and potential compression drove given the new loan yields you called out what s a reasonable pace of loan yield compression like on a run rate basis if the fed is not cutting rates drew labenne chief financial officer well it s going to depend on the mix again and the prepayments that come in as well the 12 basis points of loan yield compression that we had this quarter a little bit of that was caused by the movement as well of pace going into htm securities so i think that was a little bit elevated we obviously had the rate cut in there as well so i think it should be less than that but it will depend on the pace and speed of new originations coming on i think the other thing probably worth mentioning is for example when we look at multi family prepayments which have actually they re not where they used to be but in q4 there actually was a couple more prepayments whereas in q3 there were none a lot of what is coming off the books is kind of the same rates as what s coming on the books so it s not as though at least in the multifamily space we re having a big trade at this point in terms of yields rolling off and yields coming on in residential mortgage q4 was a big as i m sure you know was a big quarter for refi activity and so there was a little bit of yield compression that happens there whenever you get that refinance activity in mortgage seems to have slowed down but if rates continue to trend down it s the long end of the curve i m sure it will pick back up keith mestrich president and chief executive officer and steve i d just as you know i mean although the fed hasn t cut rates we ve lost 32 basis points in treasuries right over the last two weeks so it s including two basis points today so it s a tricky thing that we re looking at because some of our loans particularly in the multi families are pegged to that rate steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst right so when you think about the nim guidance for 2019 i think it was 3 55 to 3 60 you came in at the lower end of that range but you re in the range how are you thinking about a range of nim sounds like you could have much more pressure in 2020 than in 2019 drew labenne chief financial officer yes and if you think about our original guidance that was our last guidance so i think our original guidance was probably still 3 50 to 3 60 and that included no rate cuts so i think we outperformed the original guidance pretty well given what happened in the marketplace yes i mean we re not going to give guidance on nim because there are so many factors going on i think we are expecting our nii to grow we are expecting our nim to compress but i think we will probably see that for most banks in the sector especially if the yield curve keeps looking as it is over the past week or so keith mestrich president and chief executive officer just to make the point too i mean i m encouraging drew is encouraging our team right to think less about nim and more about earnings and make sure that we make decisions that are good from an earnings perspective even if they may have an adverse impact on nim in the short term and i think that s wise for us to do that particularly as we look to balance both issues in our securities portfolio and other opportunities that we have in front of us steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst right ok and then i just want to make sure i understand the commentary around pace loans now being in securities so you re guiding to double digit balance sheet growth do you think you could do double digit loan growth without pace loans and with pace now being in securities drew labenne chief financial officer i think it s possible certainly and i say this a little bit flippantly we could buy our way to any loan growth that we wanted to that s not what we re going to do we re going to be very careful on credit as we ve continued to do and we re going to make sure we re putting on at least a large portion of mission aligned assets at the same time that have attractive risk adjusted returns so i do think it s possible what we don t have this coming year or in 2020 that we had in 2019 was 177 million of indirect c i runoff that we had to also work through in 2019 so that s a big headwind that s actually out of our way for the most part in 2020 keith mestrich president and chief executive officer and it s obvious but less to be said we re not going to sort of make any sacrifice on credit right in order to just drive loan growth just not going to do that i mean we had a loan term last night that we could have put on the books i m sure and it would have deteriorated our credit standards completely and we re just not going to do that and i think that s an important principle given where we are in the cycle right now especially steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst ok i wanted to drill deeper into the pay offs in the commercial real estate book this quarter so one of your peer new york banks had good loan growth this quarter and called out how they had repurchased loans that they previously participated out to other banks are any of your paydowns from a phenomenon such as that one keith mestrich president and chief executive officer because we don t really have any participations and maybe one in that space so the answer would be no steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst no ok got it and then finally good to hear you talk about expanding right moving forward with boston and l a i assume that s in the 32 million per quarter guidance for expenses can you give us an update there where are you with hiring and when should those offices be up and running keith mestrich president and chief executive officer yes we are talking to the lead candidates in both cities i think we re a little further ahead in boston than we are in l a and my desire is to make sure i get a nice array of potential candidates to look at so i don t want to just take the first opportunity but i m hopeful that we will be able to make offers to somebody at least in boston pretty soon a little bit negotiating depending on when availability is but i would imagine boston should be up and running easily in the second quarter it would take somebody some time right to get a little finer things developing l a is a little bit behind that but l a will also have a base given our presence in california already but we re moving aggressively on this and want to get a lead banker on our model has the addition of a junior banker in each city and then somebody who really deserves an account executive role to do that again stressing we re not opening branches so we don t have a big search that we have done to go for commercial office space and things and so i m looking to do this pretty quick steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst ok great thanks for taking my questions keith mestrich president and chief executive officer yeah thanks steve steven alexopoulos j p morgan analyst thanks operator thank you it appears we have no additional questions at this time so i d like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional concluding comments keith mestrich president and chief executive officer thanks operator i just want to thank everybody for taking a little time bearing with us for the day change here i appreciate everybody taking the time to hop on a day later we re really happy about the quarter and we look forward to a pretty vibrant first quarter of 2020 as well we will talk to many of you in the coming days and see many of you at the end of april thank you operator duration 50 minutes call participants drew labenne chief

with tens of millions of chinese people quarantined inside their cities and thousands of factories closed it is already clear that the coronavirus is about to sideswipe the global economy last year s tit for tat trade war between china and the us which involved both sides slapping import tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods knocked china s already ailing gdp growth rate down to 6 in 2019 and helped depress global growth it fell from 3 6 in 2018 to 3 last year a chinese official warned last week that the spread of the virus from its beginnings in wuhan to about 10 000 victims across the country would add to the damage from the trade war and possibly cause more economic harm than the sars epidemic almost two decades ago and with eight key regions and two cities in china subject to closure of non essential business until at least 9 february the significance of the epidemic is beyond doubt zhang ming an economist at the chinese academy of social sciences part of beijing s state council predicted that china s annual growth rate could drop below an annualised 5 in the january march 2020 quarter that would be a sharp slowdown compared with 6 annualised growth in the previous quarter goldman sachs believes the fast spreading coronavirus will knock 0 4 percentage points from annualised growth in the us over the first quarter of 2020 as chinese tourism to the us dips and exports of american goods to china take a hit its central forecast is for a partial rebound in us growth in the second quarter but the risks are skewed towards a larger hit it is clear that unless a cure and a vaccination are found rapidly the fragile recovery that we predict is at risk cebr a change in the news flow could lead to increased domestic risk aversion behaviour or a sustained tightening in financial conditions a larger outbreak of the virus in the us or the fear thereof could lead to a decline in domestic travel commuting and shopping goldman notes in 2002 sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries causing global panic infecting more than 8 000 people and killing about 750 the coronavirus is spreading at a faster rate the centre for economics and business research cebr says that because those who contract it are infectious before experiencing symptoms the coronavirus could be much worse quarantine measures will largely be a matter of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted unless they apply well beyond those who are currently infected it says the chinese authorities were praised last week by the world health organization who after it declared the coronavirus to be a public health emergency of international concern but both the communist run government in beijing and the who have faced severe criticism for reacting slowly given what is known about the rapid spread of the virus it is not easy to estimate the extent of the economic damage the virus is likely to inflict but it is possible to use the sars epidemic as a guide pantheon macroeconomics estimates that sars dragged china s quarterly growth rate down to 1 8 in april june 2003 from an average of 2 8 the cebr says the knock on effect to world gdp was a fall in 2003 of between 30bn and 100bn which was equal to between 0 08 and 0 25 of global gdp our worst case calculation assumes that the coronavirus has a six times multiple effect on the chinese economy as the chinese economy is nearly four times larger relative to the world economy scaling up for this as well would create a world gdp negative impact of 1 8 to 6 based on the retrospective estimates of the impact of sars the cebr says with world gdp set to grow by 2 9 this year before the coronavirus impact became apparent it is clear that unless a cure and a vaccination are found rapidly the fragile recovery that we predict is at risk britain and the rest of europe have already had people return from china with confirmed or suspected cases of the virus leading many airlines to suspend flights to china and in some cases hong kong though not macau so far the us and canada have also seen their first cases and warned citizens not to travel to china view image in fullscreen a man in a protective facemask walking through what would normally be a busy shopping area in beijing last week photograph kevin frayer getty images the economic impact though will be most keenly felt across south east asia where china is not only a major trading partner but a source of vital revenue from tourism prakash sakpal an economist at ing illustrates the point in a report on thailand where the local currency dropped by 3 7 in value against the us dollar in january partially reversing an 8 6 appreciation last year tourism makes up a fifth of the thai economy and visitors from china alone account for about a quarter of total tourism receipts sakpal says a sharp fall in tourism spending will put a big dent in the country s current account surplus which is a measure of the money coming into the country versus the funds leaving to be spent elsewhere this surplus has been the main reason behind the thai baht s appreciation in recent years he says a decline in tourism spending has already hit the main cruise lines us operator royal caribbean cruises has cancelled three trips scheduled in february which will hit 2020 earnings by about 10 cents per share the company said a ship owned by the carnival corporation which is listed in new york and london was briefly put in quarantine in the italian port of civitavecchia trapping 66 britons and 6 000 other passengers shares in norwegian cruise line holding royal caribbean and carnival were all at least 5 lower on the new york stock exchange following the italian incident before recovering some of their losses on friday the consultancy s p global market intelligence says the decision of regional governments to extend factory closures beyond 2 february to control the virus s spread will be a major blow to china s gdp international companies are beginning to find ways of circumventing chinese companies to obtain electronics parts though us commerce secretary wilbur ross made it clear he thought most firms were unlikely to question strategic business relationships as a result of the outbreak that said apple general motors ikea and starbucks have closed much of their chinese operations as have many other foreign companies chris rogers of s p says commitments to buy 33 4bn of us agricultural exports this year made by beijing as part of a truce in the trade war might be difficult to meet but he believes there will be an opportunity later in the year to make up for lost time the expectation is that the coronavirus will soon be under control and the overall effect even on the chinese mainland will be limited the consultancy oxford economics has cut its forecast for global growth this year from 2 5 to 2 3 which would be the lowest since the 2008 financial crash considering the affected areas account for just over 50 of total chinese output we think this could lead china s annual gdp growth to slow to just 4 in the first quarter from our previous forecast of 6 it said writing in caijing magazine zhang ming said the coronavirus s economic impact could be significantly bigger than sars based on a forecast that the outbreak would peak in mid february and end by april that must be the hope of governments across the world but with the virus already thought to be in thousands of people who have no idea they are infected the fear must be that it claims more victims ruins more businesses and depresses global growth by much more than so far estimated

appointments wheeler said trump has appointed 187 judges by traditional counting methods two supreme court justices 50 appeals court judges and 135 district court judges but that it s possible to get

south korea a biden crowd trump said at the iowa rally that democratic presidential candidate joe biden drew a speech crowd so small that the campaign turned it into a roundtable discussion roping in unwitting attendees to answer questions like what do you think of socialism there is simply no evidence this happened biden s campaign says it didn t and trump s campaign did not respond to a request

the euro to dollar exchange rate is quoted at 1 10705 on monday february 3 0 17pct in the red compared to daily open technical outlook while prices have recovered from important pivot support at 1 0980 we are holding resistance in the 1 1100 1 1125 zone while this holds we see risks of renewed weakness with a break of 1 0980 suggesting the 1 0880 to 1 1240 rally was just another correction phase a move up through 1 1125 would alleviate immediate risks and suggest a further recovery can develop within a developing upper range under 1 1240 lloyds eur usd short term technicals neutral bullish according to forecasters at the canadian multinational bank scotiabank bank of scotia euro dollar cross has been in decline since mid january downside risks dominate eur usd persist says currency analysts at danske bank group quick link to analysis at the start of the week the euro to dollar exchange rate slipped as german business morale slumped unexpectedly this suggested the bloc s largest economy got off to a slow start in the new year after just missing a recession in 2019 meanwhile further data showed us new home sales slumped for the third consecutive month in december due to a shortage of new homes however traders flocked to safe haven currencies as the outbreak of coronavirus in china weighed on risk appetite the pairing was left flat on tuesday as investors awaited

wednesday morning the pairing slumped despite data showing that german consumer morale was better than expected in february however eur usd reversed earlier losses and rallied ahead and after the us federal reserve s interest rate decision the fed left rates steady as chair jerome powell said that the continued moderate growth and strong job market meant the bank did not see the need to ease monetary policy the pairing extended its gains into thursday as data showed unemployment in the eurozone fell to its lowest level in over a decade added to this higher than expected economic sentiment in the bloc sent the single currency higher as the upbeat data suggested the bloc was waving goodbye to a year of disappointing growth usd edged lower as data revealed gdp increased by 2 1 in q4 2019 while full year growth came in at 2 3 this was far below the white house s estimates of at least 3 growth at the end of the week the pairing rallied despite retail sales data from germany showing that the economy ran out of steam in the final month of 2019 added to this eurozone economic growth was slower than expected in the final quarter of last year meanwhile the dollar slumped despite data showing that us consumer spending rose steadily but weaker income gains suggested there would be moderate consumption growth in 2020 euro us dollar outlook will the pairing reverse last week s gains looking ahead to monday the euro eur could slump against the us dollar usd following the release of german manufacturing data if pmi data shows manufacturing in the bloc s largest economy remains firmly in contraction territory the single currency will fall meanwhile if monday afternoon s us manufacturing pmi data paints a more upbeat picture of the country s manufacturing sector the dollar will edge higher it s one of those big weeks in us key figures space but it remains to be seen whether those key figures will be able to gather any attention during these wuhan focused times says andreas steno larsen at nordea markets the big question is whether ism manufacturing monday will be able to defy wuhan pmis for january have though been collected prior to the 20th of january and therefore prior to the actual corona scare and most importantly boeing worries the greenback could extend monday s gains on tuesday if december s us factory orders rise higher than expected after a slump in the previous month wednesday could see a slew of disappointing data from the eurozone sending the single currency lower if both the german pmi composite and the eurozone s pmi fall below the 50 no change mark in january eur will extend its slump meanwhile if the us ism non manufacturing pmi edges higher in january this could buoy the dollar as this is the us federal reserve s preferred pmi measure however the euro could regain some losses on thursday if german factory orders rebound at the end of 2019 after a disappointing month in november weak preliminary us non farm productivity in the final quarter of last year could allow the euro to make further gains during thursday s session meanwhile at the end of the week the dollar could rebound from any losses earlier in the week following january s labour market data if us non farm payrolls jump higher than expected suggesting a strong start to the year for the labour market the euro us dollar eur usd exchange rate is likely to slide downside risks dominate eur usd in near term outlook eur usd has so far failed to make a firm break of the 1 10 level but as we have highlighted previously downside risks to eur usd still dominate say analysts at danske bank group on thursday there is yet another related risk the us imposing auto tariffs on the eu we see a 40 probability of this but what do we expect in the fx market if it happens today us imports of finished cars are 9 of total eu exports while parts account for 3 4 tariffs realistically come at 10 or 25 which we scale by either 9 0 export of assembled eu cars or 12 4 us imports of cars and parts as share of eu total exports to arrive at a guesstimate effect for eur usd this suggests a 3 4 figure decline in eur usd in the event of a 25 tariff on autos and parts however if we were to argue for a somewhat more muted effect we could speculate that donald trump may not want to apply a 25 tariff initially instead retaining leverage additionally the eu may also fold more easily and thus the scope for pricing additional tariffs could be less our base case remains that eur usd will stay within the recent range and we still target 1 11 on a 3m horizon if tariffs are initially put up at 10 for autos only the realistic eur usd downside risk seems to us to be at the lower end of 1 4 figures
hong kong china may have to cut taxes boost spending and slash interest rates to prevent the coronavirus outbreak wreaking havoc on an already fragile economy the economic impact of the virus is still impossible to determine but one state media outlet and some economists have said that china s growth rate could drop two percentage points this quarter because of the outbreak which has brought large parts of the country to a standstill a decline on that scale could mean 62 billion rs9 574 billion in lost growth international media reported china can ill afford that kind of hit growth last year was already the country s weakest in nearly three decades as china contended with rising debt and the fallout from its trade war with the united states the coronavirus which first appeared in the central city of wuhan has already killed more than 200 people and infected more people than the sars outbreak in 2003 a disease of this magnitude wasn t even on china s radar before the outbreak the government was more worried that social unrest could be its black swan problem an improbable but chaotic event officials feared could be spurred by rising unemployment now beijing is scrambling to stop the virus from cratering its economy the ruling communist party recently put premier li keqiang in charge of virus control the decision was a clear signal that stopping the virus is the priority among priorities for the government right now the official people s daily newspaper wrote in a recent commentary so far policymakers have taken some steps to help the businesses that are most affected by the rapid spread of the disease central and local governments have allocated 12 6 billion so far to spend on medical treatment and equipment major banks have cut interest rates for small businesses and individuals in the worst hit areas and the bank of china said it would allow people in wuhan and the rest of hubei province to delay their loan payments for several months if they lose their source of income because of the disruption the people s bank of china the country s central bank has said that it will ensure there is enough liquidity in the financial markets when they reopen next monday after a 10 day lunar new year holiday when hong kong s markets reopened earlier this week the hang seng index hsi plunged nearly 6 in just a few days of trading more than a dozen chinese provinces announced an extension of the lunar new year holiday by more than a week fourteen provinces and cities have said businesses need not start operations until at least the second week of february they accounted for almost 69 of china s gross domestic product in 2019 international media reported all the key eastern manufacturing provinces have extended the holiday they include guangdong home to the tech city of shenzhen across the border from hong kong shanghai home to china s largest port and a newly built tesla inc plant as well as jiangsu where nike shoes are manufactured henan in central china which has a large foxconn plant making iphones also announced the extended break the extension come on top of other measures including quarantining whole cities that are set to disrupt supply chains and logistics prompting economists to expect that this virus will deal a more severe blow to china s economy in the near term than the effect of the sars outbreak in 2003 the longer holiday is also likely to be disruptive for china s trade hitting both exports imports and the companies that rely on that exchange the 14 provinces included in the extended holiday were the source of 78 of china s exports in december last year according to bloomberg calculations based on official data those same provinces account for 90 of copper smelting at least 60 of steel production 65 of crude oil refining and 40 of coal output while the extended holiday will likely depress consumer demand for fuels and goods what it means for raw material consumption is less certain as industrial facilities often continue to run at least at partial utilization with skeleton crews even during holidays
by todd neeley dtn staff reporter omaha dtn though the number of farms filing chapter 12 bankruptcy increased in 2019 from the previous year an american farm bureau federation analysis found the number of filings in the fourth quarter fell from the previous two quarters the agriculture economy is coming off five years of falling commodity prices and weather disasters on top of trade and federal biofuel policy uncertainties the afbf analysis released on wednesday shows overall chapter 12 farm bankruptcy filings increased from 2018 to 2019 by about 20 it is the largest increase in filings since 2010 when chapter 12 filings increased by 33 coming off the recession of 2009 there were 595 chapter 12 filings in 2019 according to afbf s review of court data or about 100 more than in 2018 the highest number of filings in recent years was in 2011 when 637 farms filed for chapter 12 so in 2019 there were 2 95 bankruptcies per 10 000 farms just below 2 99 in 2011 there are a little more than 2 million farms in the united states afbf chief economist john newton told dtn the group will continue to watch chapter 12 filings closely until things start to show general signs of improvement we ll continue to do so he said the rate of filings was much higher in 1987 the year after the chapter 12 provision was created according to afbf the rate stood at a little higher than seven bankruptcies per 10 000 farms in 1987 the 147 filings in the fourth quarter of 2019 were a 14 increase from the same quarter last year but an 8 drop from the third quarter of 2019 still the number of filings has seen a quarter over quarter increase for five consecutive quarters afbf said the increased filings were not necessarily surprising given the headwinds in agriculture along with a 2019 change in chapter 12 law to raise the debt ceiling to 10 million economists will get a closer look at the state of the farm economy when usda s economic research service releases its farm income statement and balance sheet estimates next week regional state numbers wisconsin led the nation in chapter 12 filings in 2019 with 57 perhaps not a surprise considering persisting low milk prices georgia was no 2 with 41 filings ten states either saw record tying or record breaking numbers of chapter 12 filings that includes iowa illinois kansas minnesota nebraska new hampshire ohio south carolina south dakota and wisconsin afbf found all but three regions saw higher chapter 12 rates in 2019 compared to 2018 the 13 state midwest led all regions in accounting for 46 of chapter 12 filings recording 273 in 2019 compared to 234 in 2018 southeastern states came in at no 2 accounting for 22 of all filings depending on perspective net farm income in 2019 inflation adjusted dollars is either down 33 from a record high or up nearly 40 from the decade low set in 2016 afbf stated in its analysis regardless of perspective net farm income in 2019 is slightly above the 20 year average but was supported in large part by the trump administration s efforts to financially shield farmers from unfair retaliatory tariffs afbf said that without trade support farm related income from crop and livestock sales in 2019 when adjusted for inflation would have been at the second lowest level in the past 10 years at 63 6 billion the corollary to this is that farm bankruptcies could have been worse considering the record high farm debt of 415 billion in nominal terms and the likely difficulties servicing this debt without the revenue from the market facilitation program afbf said the trump administration is not expected to announce a third round of trade assistance given the welcome trade news with respect to japan usmca and a china phase one deal as a result farm financial conditions in 2020 will come down to notwithstanding any other black swans a race between the additional grain and oilseed supplies likely to come online following a record prevented planting year and any demand boosts for u s agriculture that results from these new and enhanced trading opportunities ag lending declines even as farms continued to show signs of financial distress the volume of agriculture loans at commercial banks declined in 2019 according to the federal reserve bank of kansas city although farm lending volumes remained historically high total non real estate farm loans decreased by about 12 in the fourth quarter according to the federal reserve bank and for the first time since 2017 declined in consecutive quarters following average annual growth of more than 10 in 2017 and 2018 and several quarters of sharp increases lending activity contracted in the second half of the year and on average was 5 lower in 2019 the bank said in an analysis despite decreasing from a year ago farm lending volumes remained higher than the 20 year average total volume of non real estate loans averaged about 90 billion in 2019 and was about 8 above the average since 1999 overall persistent weaknesses in the farm sector have continued to stimulate strong demand for agricultural lending although market facilitation program payments in the second half of 2019 and relatively strong crop yields may have curbed demand in the fourth quarter during a july 2019 webinar donald l swanson an attorney with omaha based law firm koley jessen pc llo said strategies to improve a farm s finances

in his news conference following the federal reserve s january meeting which wrapped up wednesday chairman jerome powell said the chinese coronavirus is a situation that bears watching even as he stressed that the fed s mandate would remain focused on u s economic growth powell also once again emphasized the many ways trade uncertainty has trickled into decisions made by executives and policymakers even as he sounded a reassuring town about the overall economic outlook uncertainties about the outlook remain including those posed by the new coronavirus powell said in his prepared remarks a theme he expanded on during the question and answer period it s a very significant issue he said of the virus which to date has sickened more than 7 700 people and killed 170 powell acknowledged the potential for worldwide disruption and uncertainty about macroeconomic effects in china saying we are very carefully monitoring the situation the issue with the coronavirus is we re not really clear on what this virus is all about said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america north pointed out that the sars epidemic of 2002 and 2003 spooked the markets but ultimately had little bearing on the trajectory of chinese gdp growth we think as does the futures market it s likely we ll see one more cut this year north said if the economic situation were to worsen between now and march if hiring were to slow or wages were to decelerate there s room for an insurance cut with rates running low if conditions warrant but the fed would hope not to use it said chris battifarano chief investment officer of finemark national bank trust the trio of rate cuts the fed undertook last year might have been enough to ward off an economic slump in the short term but powell as well as other market observers noted that these interventions leave policymakers with fewer tools to fight a recession in spite of numerous criticisms from president donald trump the federal reserve has stayed away from the negative interest rates that have characterized many other central bank approaches to monetary policy and powell indicated this wouldn t change anytime soon explaining that low interest rates could become a self fulfilling cycle from which economies can struggle to emerge we re determined to avoid it here in the united states he said it s become very clear that inflation is the problem that central banks can solve battifarano said but he pointed to japan s prolonged economic slump as a cautionary tale of how negative interest rates can play out long term not only does it not work it s damaging to banks traditional spread lending mode he said and analysts readily point out that the u s has thus far managed to avoid the broader economic weaknesses present in economies like japan and germany i do think they were able to preemptively act and give the market an additional cushion said lindsey piegza chief economist at stifel fixed income they feel they were able to navigate this soft landing she said noting how powell worked to thread the needle between encouraging and cautious in his remarks on wednesday the consumer is still shouldering the entire economy said one analyst the fed wants to look reasonable in their acknowledgement about some of the downside risks she said powell also addressed the one significant change economists picked up on in the statement the bank released noticing that the fed shifted from characterizing household spending as moderate rather than strong piegza said this was significant given that powell s remarks emphasized the singular role the u s consumer is playing in sustaining the country s economic momentum it s hard to see other bright spots besides the consumer she said noting that metrics on manufacturing exports and business investment remain lackluster even with low unemployment and a soaring stock market the consumer is still shouldering the entire economy she said the chairman said progress on trade between the u s and china along with the signing of the usmca were beneficial but he emphasized that the businesses and markets still perceive cause for concern those are potentially positive things for the economy without question powell said but he added that a sustained reduction in uncertainty over time would be necessary to pull business investment out of its slump a reduction that currently is not present trade policy uncertainty remains elevated it hasn t gone away powell said there s a bit of a wait and see attitude some experts also pointed out that it still is unclear whether or not the reduction in trade tensions will benefit american workers and shoppers we don t know how that s going to trickle down yet to the u s consumer said brian pirri principal of new england investment retirement group it s a positive that there was an initial deal done and a holding off on some of the tariffs but i think it s too early to say it s going to have a meaningful impact on the u s and the consumer he said

get the inside scoop on today s biggest stories in markets tech and business delivered daily read preview sens bernie sanders and elizabeth warren both promise to cancel student loan debt if elected president sanders has called for cancelling all student loan debt then capping future interest rates on such loans at 1 88 warren s plan to unilaterally cancel student loan debt on day one of her presidency is slightly more limited with a cap of 50 000 per borrower this story is available exclusively to business insider subscribers become an insider and start reading now have an account log in unfortunately neither plan would do much to change the conditions that got us into the spiraling college affordability crisis in the first place warren s proposal includes efforts to rein in the for profit college industry crack down on predatory student lending and combat the racial disparities in our higher education system that s fine but it s little more than a band aid on a gaping wound advertisement that s probably because identifying the real villain of the student loan crisis runs counterintuitive to sanders and warren s throw money at the problem philosophy the secret there s strong evidence that federally subsidized student loans are the single greatest factor contributing to the explosive rise in higher education tuitions over the past several decades studies have looked into the idea that the very existence of federally guaranteed loans incentivizes colleges to continue to raise tuition an idea called the bennett hypothesis named after former secretary of education william bennett by backing the loans the government guarantees the schools will get their money and the loans help ensure rising costs won t lead to a drop in demand it s a win win for the colleges but if results count for anything the currently constructed system of government subsidized student loans represents an abject failure advertisement the primary cause of the student loan crisis is an untouchable topic the average price of college tuition rose 53 between 2001 and 2017 adjusted for inflation and that s just the sticker price additional expenses incurred by students and parents during secondary education abound not least among them is the interest on student loan debt which is not counted in the aforementioned average and remains long after graduation but the forces of supply and demand are not naturally driving the high cost of college rather demand is artificially high because of the increasing amounts of available loans too much money is available for degrees that aren t worth it a 2015 study by the federal reserve bank of new york found subsidized loan maximums loans for which the interest is paid by the government while the student is in school represent a pass through effect that adds 0 60 on the dollar to tuition for unsubsidized loans it s 0 20 on the dollar advertisement the study also cited a 2013 study published by the econometric society and a 2016 study published by the national bureau of economic research both of which found increases in borrowing limits generate tuition increases and borrowing limit increases represent the single most important factor in explaining tuition increases between 1987 and 2010 additionally they said a full 40 of tuition increases can be explained by this factor adding that falling state appropriations to schools are much less responsible the authors of the fed study said the increase in pell grants over the same period produced a positive but statistically insignificant effect on rising tuition prices related stories but neither sanders nor warren nor their 2020 democratic rivals have taken it upon themselves to address this issue instead the debate has centered on the feasibility of wiping 1 6 trillion in student loan debt about 11 of the total us household debt off the books by executive order we need to talk about the student loan bubble not just the debt social security has long been considered the third rail in electoral politics you don t touch it lest you incur the wrath of tens of thousands of particularly older voters advertisement student loans might be another third rail particularly for democrats moody s investors service released a report last week showing that the rate of loan repayment has slowed and this slowing of repayments rather than new issuance is now the primary reason the student debt bubble continues to grow just 3 of loans are repaid in full annually and that rate is likely going to worsen it s a depressing cycle if the government keeps raising the limits on its loans colleges will keep raising prices after all they get paid regardless of whether the student defaults on the loan advertisement the result loans are slow to be repaid and interest accrues and the student loan debt bubble grows few would argue that a generation crippling 1 6 trillion in outstanding debt is a national crisis that needs to be addressed that s why it s odd for the conversation to never extend beyond debt cancellation for political reasons neither the debt cancellation advocates nor their democratic opponents want to touch the idea that the guaranteed student loan system has fundamental issues this leads only to a back and forth on cancellation instead of meaningful debate about true reform political expediency aside this conversation needs to happen advertisement there will be at least four more democratic debates so maybe the remaining candidates should be asked about student loan debt and the striking publicly available data it doesn t matter who absorbs the losses or by what authority a president can wipe out a massive amount of debt if we re just going to have this same conversation in a decade in a country struggling to fill good paying vocational jobs that don t require a college degree we shouldn t assume that secondary education is the answer for everyone it s also worth exploring the inherent trade offs of subsidized student loans access to higher education generally leads to higher incomes and increases in student loan limits leads to greater college enrollment but not all the outcomes are positive advertisement for example student loan debt was deemed a significant factor responsible for the 9 percentage point drop between 2005 and 2014 in rates of homeownership among people age 24 to 34 according to a 2019 federal reserve study the authors said per capita student loan debt doubled during that 10 year timeframe if the government curbed its seemingly boundless supply of student loan funds it s likely that many private liberal arts colleges would be forced to dispense with some extraneous administrators and other causes of bloat tuition costs would almost certainly drop as a result but we won t know until we at least diagnose the cause of the malady should sanders or warren win the presidency and miraculously make 1 6 trillion disappear that s great for the indebted but it still leaves all the mechanisms in place for another student loan bubble
facing one of the steepest slides in growth and just into the first year of its second term the nda 2 government decided to play safe when it came to imparting a positive impulse to the economy union budget 2020 21 presented by finance minister nirmala sitharaman saturday carried a visible imprint of the prime minister s fiscal conservatism inasmuch as it kept a tight leash on expenditure tacitly admitting there was little headroom for higher spending fm nirmala sitharaman interview we want to gradually remove everything called exemptions advertisement in doing so however the budget reconciled to a new normal of sub par growth almost conceding it was unable to do the heavy lifting particularly at a time when private investment has failed to revive consumption has collapsed and exports have shown no signs of a pick up for 2020 21 it projected a nominal growth rate of 10 per cent translating into a real growth of 5 5 6 per cent given that average inflation for the year may hover around 4 4 5 per cent despite a sharp cut in expenditure necessitated more due to falling receipts the centre s fiscal deficit was 0 5 percentage points higher than budgeted for 2019 20 at 3 8 per cent of the gdp for the next year too the budget has curtailed spending across sectors including the flagship schemes hoping to rein in the deficit at 3 3 per cent of gdp this however excludes a bevy of off budget borrowing items sitharaman s only significant intervention related to the overhaul of the personal income tax structure while she proposed doing away with 70 of the 100 exemptions she added two more slabs of 15 per cent and 25 per cent she claimed the effort was aimed at simplifying the tax regime and would give more money in the hands of the middle class advertisement the minister also said that an eligible startup having a turnover of up to rs 25 crore is allowed a deduction of 100 per cent of its profits for three consecutive assessment years out of seven years if the total turnover does not exceed rs 25 crore express photo the minister also said that an eligible startup having a turnover of up to rs 25 crore is allowed a deduction of 100 per cent of its profits for three consecutive assessment years out of seven years if the total turnover does not exceed rs 25 crore express photo tax experts however are not sure many argued there was no substantial benefit across different levels of income for individual taxpayers and made the new regime more unwieldy and complicated while the finance minister said there would be a revenue loss of rs 40 000 crore if all taxpayers shifted to the new regime the budget has estimated personal income tax collections to grow 14 per cent finance ministry officials said the restructuring of rates was the first move and may over a period of time replace the existing regime where exemptions on housing loans provident funds life and health insurance leave travel concessions house rent allowance and standard deduction are allowed the budget sent the bombay stock exchange sensitive index dropping almost 2 5 per cent or 988 points the biggest fall ever on budget day since pranab mukherjee presented the first budget of upa 2 in july 2009 advertisement while low growth estimates for 2020 21 forced the finance minister s hands in rasing tax receipts she turned to disinvestments including a public listing of state owned insurance behemoth lic lic alone is estimated to rake in rs 90 000 crore in the total disinvestment receipts of rs 2 10 000 crore the highest ever target set in any budget raising such huge sums from the market carries a substantial execution risk the chequered history in achieving stake sale targets is a further dampener for the markets similarly sitharaman has estimated a one time windfall from telecom sector and hoped to realise rs 1 33 027 crore next year a 126 per cent increase from 2019 20 explained decoding the budget her estimates on tax receipts for the next year also raise questions even if they were way off the mark in 2019 20 the estimates for corporate tax collection growth at 11 5 per cent look ambitious more so when it had dipped by 8 per cent in 2019 20 corporate tax accounts for roughly 18 per cent of all receipts advertisement the unprecedented political mandate to the narendra modi government in 2019 lok sabha elections did not reflect in the risk averse budget that sitharaman presented she could have done much more for the non banking financial sector nbfcs that has choked due to lack of funds lurching from one crisis to the other illustration e p unny illustration e p unny the signs were all too visible for the last 15 months but the government stayed away from proactively intervening to stem the bleeding surprisingly even for the banking sector the government did not provision any recapitalisation through bonds which would have hardly cost the exchequer the lack of a coherent strategy to resolve this logjam in the financial sector could only prolong the slowdown in both investment and consumption in line with protectionist tendencies across major world economies and giving in to domestic industry demands sitharaman raised import duty on more than 20 products ranging from toys footwear and furniture to electrical appliances the highest increase in duty is on walnuts 30 per cent to 100 per cent surprising given that the government is setting the stage for a trade deal with the united states the finance minister also accepted india inc s demand to reverse the taxability of dividends back to the recipients now dividends will be taxed in the hands of recipients a move that will cost the exchequer rs 25 000 crore companies paid a 10 per cent tax on dividends whereas individuals would pay as much as 42 per cent at the highest income tax bracket advertisement some measures that sitharaman announced to attract equity flows include tax exemptions on foreign sovereign wealth fund investments in infrastructure a hike in fpi limits for corporate bonds to 15 per cent of outstanding from 9 per cent and the opening of certain specified categories of government securities to non resident investors

khartoum a top un official has warned that the international community would pay a terrible price if it fails to help rebuild sudan s dilapidated economy as the african country transitions to civilian rule the story of sudan in year 2020 is not the story of the previous government united nations development programme undp administrator achim steiner told afp in an interview during his visit to sudan this week it is the story in which waiting for too long to actually step in and support this development process may have a terrible price more than a year after the start of a nationwide protest movement that led to the ouster of long time ruler omar al bashir last april sudan faces a series of challenges driven by an economic crisis years of recession were a key trigger for the protest movement against bashir s 30 year old autocratic regime months after he was ousted the economy remains burdened with foreign debt of more than 60 billion inflation of about 60 percent soaring unemployment and chronic shortage of fuel and foreign currency but these challenges are exactly the opportunity for the international community to step in and help sudan said steiner the first undp chief to ever visit the northeast african country here is a country in which the youth and particularly the women have not only managed to pull off a peaceful revolution in large part but they actually have an agenda to build a developmental state steiner said the international community must recognise how unusual and how extraordinarily helpful this is in a region that is otherwise providing more and more worrying news about political instability and about extremism sudanese officials say there has been a lacklustre response from the international community to the country s reform process led by new prime minister abdalla hamdok a well respected economist most blame washington s continued blacklisting of sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism which makes international banking cumbersome and keeps overseas investors away in october 2017 washington lifted its 20 year old trade embargo imposed on sudan but kept the country on the terrorism blacklist along with iran syria and north korea removing sudan from the blacklist is likely to take time with washington seeking assurances that bashir s regime is being fully dismantled steiner said that for many sudan s blacklisting was no longer a crucial issue and he urged the us congress to expedite the delisting he said the international community was taking sudan a little bit for granted we are in danger of forgetting that sudan is actually a story that is more hopeful than it has been for 30 years and are we missing an opportunity to actually lean in and support it said steiner we as undp are certainly committed to increase our engagement this is a win win proposition global financial institutions demand that sudan launch widespread reforms to revive its economy including cutting subsidies which according to steiner should be done gradually our role and that of the world bank the imf is to come up with wiser and smarter advice than simply saying to sudan well you are failing in your reform if you don t do x or y he said steiner lauded the new authorities for engaging in talks with rebel groups for ending conflicts in darfur blue nile and south kordofan regions riven by fighting under bashir over the years hundreds of thousands have been killed and millions displaced in fighting between bashir s forces and rebels in these regions steiner said it was up to the sudanese people to decide what kind of society they now wanted but they needed the help of the international community to build that society

are encouraged by the momentum of the division delivering now seven consecutive quarters of positive organic volume growth our health hygiene specialties division reported flat organic volumes excluding the customer product transition we spoke of previously and saw sequential quarter over quarter volume improvement we continue to innovate deploy new capital for organic growth and focus on increasing our share of wallet with existing customers while pivoting our business to faster growing markets such as adult incontinence feminine care and medical our investments made in china and

progress on boarding our new business pipeline discussed in previous calls additionally we have started to deploy capital as part of our commitment of investing 150 million over the next three years toward growth in next generation products and lastly our consumer packaging international business reported another quarter of solid results this segment primarily consists of business from our recent acquisition of rpc group which closed in july 9th 2019 it s now been two quarters since we acquired rpc and we re even more excited about the long term benefits and strategic rationale of this

more details and remarks and then i ll come back to discuss our strategy and then open the call for questions mark mark w miles chief financial officer thank you tom i would like to refer everyone to slide 6 now as tom referenced first quarter reported sales were up 43 to just over 2 8 billion the increase included revenue from the acquisition of rpc and continued positive organic volumes in our north american consumer packaging business these positives were partially offset by lower selling prices due to the pass through of lower resin costs and the sale of our seal for life business from an earnings perspective the december quarter operating ebitda increased by 36 to 451 million the increase included contributions in the rpc acquisition synergy realization and organic earnings growth at our north american consumer packaging segment these improvements were partially offset by the sale of our seal for life business and anticipated unfavorable price cost spread and our engineered materials and health hygiene specialty segments now looking at the results of each operating segment starting on slide 7 the prior year results have been restated to match the current structure for the quarter our consumer packaging international division delivered sales of over 1 billion and operating ebitda of 142 million this division primarily consists of business acquired as part of the rpc transaction and therefore we re not included in our historical results so for comparison purposes we are utilizing results prior to our ownership legacy rpc operating ebitda and volumes declined low single digits compared to the prior year quarter specifically our pharmaceutical and waste management businesses produced solid volume growth in the quarter along with flat volumes in our food business offset by general softness in european markets as a reminder 70 of the portfolio is consumer non discretionary products such as food beverage healthcare and personal care and the remaining 30 is tied in the end markets like building and construction automotive distribution and other specialty categories we now have two quarters of results under our belt and remain very confident of the long term value creation opportunities from the combination through the first two quarters we are encouraged by the prospects of the business and proud of the execution of the team with the legacy rpc business generating low single digit operating ebitda growth on a constant currency basis on slightly lower base volumes next on slide 8 sales in our consumer packaging north america division were 680 million in the quarter which was 13 higher than the december 2018 quarter as a result of the addition of the north american rigid business from the rpc acquisition along with better than expected organic volume growth of 3 as the business has continued executing its long term strategy focusing on advantaged products in targeted markets these contributions were partially offset by lower selling prices and the contractual pass through of lower resin cost to our customers operating ebitda for the division in the quarter was 121 million compared to 88 million in the prior year quarter this 38 increase was primarily driven by the contributions in the rpc acquisition including synergies from the combination and continued organic volume growth turning to slide 9 our health hygiene specialties division delivered sales of 541 million in the quarter compared to 659 million in the prior year quarter the decrease was primarily attributed to the contractual pass through of lower resin prices to our customers the sale of our seal for life business and the customer product transition in hygiene we referenced on prior earnings calls excluding the customer product transition organic sales volume was flat for the quarter and on track relative to our commitment to generate positive organic volume growth as we continue to secure incremental demand and pivot our product portfolio to faster growing end markets operating ebitda decreased by 18 million from the prior year quarter when adjusted for the sale of the seal for life business this decrease was consistent with our expectation as highlighted on our last earnings call as a result of unfavorable price cost spread and the lost earnings from the customer product transition this will be the last quarter the customer product transition will have a significant impact on us on our year over year comparison next on slide 10 sales for our engineered materials division was 585 million for the quarter compared to 661 million and the prior year quarter the decrease was primarily attributed to the pass through of lower resin prices and lower organic volumes which were consistent with our expectation as we sequentially improved volumes and continue the qualification process of recent business wins our effort and focus to regain market share with regional and local customers is positively impacting our results operating ebitda in our engineered materials division was 106 million compared to 126 million in the prior year quarter primarily as a result of unfavorable price cost spread is expected we are encouraged by the progress our team has made and the positive momentum of the business this momentum can be seen with operating ebitda in the december quarter coming in higher and the seasonally stronger september quarter slide 11 provides a summary of our income statement for our first fiscal quarter overall operating income was 199 million in the quarter compared to 176 million in the prior year quarter primarily attributed to the improved operating ebitda just discussed partially offset by incremental depreciation and amortization from the rpc acquisition our net income for the quarter was 47 million and our adjusted earnings per share was 0 56 noting that we do not add back amortization of intangibles from acquisitions if we were to add back this amortization it would result in an annual adjusted eps improvement of over 30 and should be considered when comparing to other companies that adjust for amortization of intangibles from acquisitions next on slide 12 the company generated 218 million of cash flow from operations in the quarter compared to 161 million in the december 2018 quarter increasing over 35 primarily from incremental cash flow resulting from the rpc acquisition net capital expenditures in the quarter were 148 million as we incurred spending on cost reduction initiatives as well as customer linked growth related projects and in line with our 600 million plan for fiscal 2020 our free cash flow for the december 2019 quarter was in line with the prior year quarter of 70 million for the four quarters ended free cash flow totaled 764 million with our substantial free cash flow and our commitment to strengthen our balance sheet we completed a partial redemption of 100 million on our 6 notes during the quarter and also issued a redemption notice on another 100 million that closed just last week we are pleased to report that we completed our first issuance into the european bond market opening a new market for berry we issued two first lien notes a eur700 million five year bond at a 1 fixed rate and a eur375 million seven year bond at a fixed rate of 1 5 with the proceeds used to repay our eur1 1 billion term loan also during the quarter we refinanced 4 25 billion of our us term loans reducing the interest rate spread by 50 basis points annual cash interest savings from these recent refinancings and debt repayment is 45 million we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our consistently increasing dependable and improving free cash flow provides us the opportunity to further improve our strong balance sheet as we have demonstrated historically our fiscal year 2020 free cash flow guidance and assumptions are shown on slide 13 today we are reaffirming our fiscal 2020 free cash flow of 800 million which includes 1 4 billion of cash flow from operations partially offset by capital expenditures of 600 million this guidance includes the use of cash for working capital and other restructuring related costs related to the rpc acquisition of 90 million along with cash taxes of 160 million and cash interest of 500 million based on current interest rates we will have a tailwind on cash interest given the completed refinancings and debt reduction just referenced additionally as softness in european markets persist we would anticipate a headwind to our fiscal year earnings forecast the volume trajectory of our legacy businesses remain on track as we anticipate positive organic base volume growth in our march 2020 quarter we are proud of our history of exceeding our free cash guidance each and every year looking beyond 2020 including realization of synergies and excluding the associated integration costs our normalized free cash flow would be more than 900 million which represents a free cash flow yield of nearly 15 using our quarter end market capitalization this concludes my financial review and now i will turn it back to tom thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer thanks mark now across the company as we look forward our teams continue to be focused on integrating rpc acquisition optimize our cost structure and fully realizing acquisition synergies along with managing the investments in growth initiatives in each of our divisions going forward we will continue to focus on locating and identifying organic growth opportunities with targeted investments in select markets with advanced innovative solutions to provide high quality products and service to our customers next the transformative acquisition of rpc gives us a world class product innovation engine where we enjoy leading positions in higher value added closures dispensing systems medical devices and healthcare packaging we have and will continue to commit resources to create profitable and sustainable organic growth across these markets similarly rpc s presence in emerging markets complements various growth objectives in multiple industry segments the strategic merit long term benefit financial impact of this combination represents an incredible opportunity for all stakeholders being able to leverage our combined know how material science supply chain product development manufacturing technology and sustainable solutions gives us certainty that the combination will benefit berry in the years ahead despite the percent i m sorry we remain confident in our total cost synergy target of 150 million with half or 75 million expected to be realized in fiscal year 2020 and again with the rpc acquisition we can generally say we re even more exciting now than ever about the growth potential of its combination the best practice sharing and global servicing capabilities it will provide coupled with an unmatched unique set of global product solution offerings for our customers creating an extraordinary opportunity for all stakeholders which will generate much value we continue to work diligently across all our businesses to grow organically and have been able to demonstrate organic volume growth by providing advantaged products in targeted markets as evidenced in our consumer packaging north american segment which has grown positive on for the past seven quarters our organic growth projects in both engineered materials and health hygiene specialties divisions remain on track and we remain confident in our projections of volume inflection for these divisions in fiscal 2020 our record level of expected capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 of 600 million is further evidence to our commitment and focus on organic growth while maintaining our low cost position in the markets we serve to drive further value for berry additionally i want to highlight again the continued strength we are seeing in our consumer packaging business despite the perception of possible headwinds regarding plastics we continue to grow our share versus alternate substrates evidenced by nearly two years of averaging 3 organic volume growth inside our north america consumer packaging business through plastics advantages of offering lighter weight clarity design versatility durability protection and cost and for these same benefit that is taking considerable share over the past 50 years we now see additional opportunities that we designed for sustainability and provide optionality for our customers to reduce plastics waste to be clear we are doing everything possible to increase the demand of recycled materials such as lightweighting reformulation tagging and identification and chemical recycling all in an effort to create a more circular economy as the market navigates and choose the best options to improve recycling rates and reduce plastics waste berry along with rpc already proven expertise puts us in a leadership and scale position to assist our customers meeting their sustainability goals and initiatives lastly i would like to highlight that we remain committed to maintain a strong balance sheet and we are well positioned to continue our historical track record of growing our free cash flow we feel very confident in our ability to meet our 800 million free cash flow target in fiscal year 2020 just as we ve done every single year as a publicly traded company and we re equally confident in our expectations of volume trajectory in fiscal 2020 and finally berry will continue to take the steps necessary to remain a leader in the markets where we participate through a relentless focus on building and strengthening our competitive advantages to ultimately maximize shareholder value the management of berry continues to be focused on finding ways to extract more value for our stakeholders by reinvesting in our leading low cost position leveraging our resources around the businesses with the greatest opportunity to grow and create value for our customers all while doing our part to protect our environment i am confident that the people at berry will continue to drive positive results and achieve our goals and mission of always advancing to protect what s important thank you for your continued interest in berry and at this time mark and i will be glad to answer any questions you may have questions and answers operator ladies and gentlemen at this time we would like to open up the question and answer session our first question comes from the line of neel kumar from morgan stanley your line is open neel kumar morgan stanley analyst hi good morning thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer hi neel neel kumar morgan stanley analyst you talked about some earnings risk from the weaker european economic environment can you just give us a sense of how you would quantify the downside and how are trends looking so far in your march quarter for the industrial piece of the business for rpc thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer well like we said we re it s early in the quarter right now but clearly while we re pleased with the progress we made inside of rpc relative to synergy realization we did see softness in our industrial space and generally just european market landscape as a whole both eastern and western europe that was offset somewhat by strength in our pharma business waste management and the food business was relatively flat so again we are assuming going forward flat volumes for the legacy rpc business and at this time you know we re watching it closely to see just how transitory this is at this stage neel kumar morgan stanley analyst okay thanks and then just for my follow up could you just give some more color on the price cost headwinds in em and hh s i know that some of it s been driven by the cost of onboarding new business and the negative operating leverage but you also expect that to inflect positive in 2q for em and 3q for hh s along with volumes and then are you what are you embedding in terms of price cost in your full year guidance thanks mark w miles chief financial officer yes sure for both businesses we expect that relationship to continue to be negative in the march quarter and expect inflection to occur within the june quarter for both hh s and em for the same reasons as we continue to see the volumes inflect on some of the start up costs associated with the new assets wind down in the upcoming quarters both i would say inflection within the june quarter and that is both of those assumptions are embedded within our guidance thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer operator next question operator yes sir our next question comes from the line of george staphos from bofa your line is open george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi everyone good morning thanks for all the details guys it s early in the year and i wouldn t have expected you to adjust your guidance either way frankly unless something significant had changed but nonetheless one of the obvious questions i think neel was touching on a little bit is you know the risk that europe presents or maybe it doesn t to your free cash flow guidance so is there is the takeaway yes you ve gotten whatever after tax perhaps about a 30 million benefit from the refinancing and maybe it s a little bit less than that because it would happen partially through the year because of the european risk is that basically one offsetting the other in terms of why you didn t adjust guidance now or is there something else that s at play here perhaps it s just it s too early in the year to adjust guidance and again if you re in our seat part two of my question here and we re trying to determine what combination of macro or other fundamental trends that we could track from the outside market that would occur that would make reaching your guidance a little bit more difficult than currently is the case thank you mark w miles chief financial officer yes i think george relative to the interest comment it s a combination of the refinancings debt repayment as well as softer interest rates and the order of magnitude of all of that would be out of the tailwind of 50 million that s pre tax on fiscal 2020 relative to our original guidance to your point it s still early in the year but based on current conditions if interest rates were to remain the same and things were to play out as expected we would have a tailwind of about 50 million pre tax on interest costs relative to european economies in our guidance as you pointed out appropriately it s early in the year we have a flat assumption as you may recall embedded in our guidance it started off a little weaker than that in europe we had offsets in our north america consumer packaging business as well as hh s that got off to a little stronger start relative to volumes that helped to offset that weakness in q1 as you pointed out it s just early in the year we have a short cycle business to the extent european economies stayed the same as they did in q1 it would be a pretty similar offset to the interest savings that we have but as you said still early we ll continue to update the market on a quarterly basis thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer and george i would say any macro factors in europe we believe ultimately will be transitory the business will be a low single digit grower long term we have no doubts about that whatsoever we continue invest in aspects of that business specifically around dispensing solutions and closures because that s with the combination of rpc in europe and legacy berry we have a global leading portfolio around those product lines serving areas like healthcare pharmaceutical as you heard from our results both those business lines with food being flat and waste management was favorable as well so a little early in the year but you know we re just articulating what we re seeing from a macro perspective but by no means do we think that has any negative impact relative to our expectation that this will be a low single digit grower longer term george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst right but you know if the exit rate continues the rest of year basically the best you could model now and we won t hold you to this because there s so many vagaries in the model and the forecast anyway it would offset the interest but hopefully it shouldn t continue for the whole year is that a fair summary mark w miles chief financial officer yes that s fair thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer yes that s fair george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thank you all right guys thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of anthony pettinari from citi your line is open anthony pettinari citigroup analyst good morning tom i think you both your legacy business and our rpc have facilities in china and i was wondering if you could just remind us what your total presence in china is now from a sales perspective and then just what impact you re seeing or you might anticipate seeing from the coronavirus thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer thanks anthony we ve got 15 facilities within what i would describe as the affected areas of china and thailand those regions represent about 5 of our overall sales i m frankly very proud of our berry team in china we are actually prioritizing the manufacture of materials non wovens specifically for the healthcare market we have been working with local authorities to maximize 24 7 the production of surgical grade face mask materials n95 respirators as well as surgical gowns and drapes for the protection of airborne and blood borne pathogens in the region our plans continue to operate we continue to work closely with the relevant health authorities with the priority of making certain our people are safe but similarly consistent with our mission of always advancing to protect what s important we re providing products on the non wovens side to support what is a growing crisis around the world with protected solutions specific to face masks gowns and in the united states the protection of disinfectant wipes for surgical suites and other regions so the business is very active relative to that and we are prioritizing the healthcare and medical portfolio across all of our sites specifically in our nanhai facility in china anthony pettinari citigroup analyst okay that s great to hear and i guess just sticking with hh s you indicated organic volumes were ahead of your expectations in the quarter it seemed like some of the big customers in the space maybe had a tough quarter from a volume standpoint just wondering what you re doing that kind of allowed you to outperform your own expectations in the quarter on hh s thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer we have i m very proud of this team and as we ve talked about for several quarters the level of agility that this business showed when frankly we made a growing focused effort to increase our share of wallet with existing customers we made targeted investments in faster growing regions of the world we pivoted our portfolio to areas such as adult incontinence feminine care biopharma and specialty applications and it s paying dividends i will reiterate i m very confident we will hit the volume inflection as we ve committed anthony pettinari citigroup analyst okay that s helpful i ll turn it over operator our next question comes from the line of ghansham panjabi from baird your line is open ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst hey guys good morning thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer good morning mark w miles chief financial officer good morning ghansham ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst hey tom just picking up on that last comment on the march quarter volume inflection year over year and just to clarify is that comment specific to legacy berry so cp north america engineered materials and hh s or does that include rpc as well and if so does that assume the rpc volumes will be flat just trying to get a better sense of that thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer yes relative to the organic volume tied to legacy berry that would be the organic definition and we re assuming it s going forward i m sorry ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst okay and then thanks for clarifying and then for the em segment you know does have some level of macroeconomic exposure i think with industrial end markets etc can you just give us a sense as to how big that industrial end market composite would be for that segment how do they perform in the december quarter and what are you embedding for that specific end market for the march quarter thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer yes on previous calls we ve talked about our efforts to ultimately regain our share at small and mid sized customers i m very pleased with our progress toward that objective and ultimately it s driving the confidence that we have in the volume inflection you know i will state that the month of december for engineered materials business was positive on a year over year basis which is a positive inflection for us relative to our q2 pivot to positive growth we are represented by small now mid sized as well as national distributors it was a key objective for us to regain that share and similarly we re also as mark had talked about some of the price cost headwind part of that s also driven by additional resources that we brought into the business from a technical perspective to not only onboard the new demand pipeline that we talked of in the past but also relative to the support of our capital investments which are about a 150 million that we ll invest over the next three years to support not only next generation products but also invest in our conversion cost to make certain that it that we maintain our low cost leadership position i m also pleased that from a commercial perspective the team has done an excellent job not only working with our operations to onboard the pipeline but also continue to build that pipeline and i feel pretty confident that the size of the pipeline that we ll enjoy in 2020 will be consistent with what we saw in 2019 as well so the commitment that we re making toward organic growth it s real it s for all of our businesses again with the objective to have all our business to deliver in low single digit growth mark w miles chief financial officer this is mark ghansham the only thing i would add is so engineered materials is almost exclusively a north american business our health hygiene specialties is global business where we did see some softness again in europe they were able to overcome that in the other regions and achieve flat volume even with that weakness so thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer yes i think that s a great point as mark said the weakness we saw was not tied specifically to rpc we saw it similarly in our european base business tied to hhs but we were fortunate to offset it with strength in the cp north america and north american hhs business in the quarter ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst and just to clarify that 70 30 for rpc that you sort of outlined what s that 70 due from a volume standpoint in the december quarter and what about that other 30 thanks again mark w miles chief financial officer yes i don t have that breakdown in front of me ghansham i think the weakness that was more pronounced in the 30 than the 70 but i don t have it broken down in that manner but it was a larger negative in the 30 more industrial type applications on the legacy rpc business thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer yes more industrial applications automotive some softness as well as you ve heard in other calls relative to the personal care business ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst got it thanks again guys operator our next question comes from the line of tyler langton from jpmorgan your line is open tyler langton jpmorgan analyst good morning tom and mark thanks i guess now that you ve had time to dig into rpc a bit more i mean are there any i guess assets that you d kind of consider selling and then also just have you rationalized any products i know there s not a whole lot overlap with your sort of consumer north america but has there been any sort of rationalization that s you know sort of weighed on volumes thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer not not significant rationalization from an rpc perspective but i would know any time we do an acquisition and with a portfolio of the size of berry s as well prior to the acquisition of rpc we re constantly looking at the portfolio and determining if there s areas that ultimately are going to be prioritized relative to our growth objectives relative to paring or shedding businesses that s an active process that we undertake and at a point in time that we have anything to share that is actionable we ll be certain to share on our future call tyler langton jpmorgan analyst great and then just with consumer north america the volumes up 3 i guess could you just give a little bit more detail sort of what s driving that growth and then i guess compared to last quarter i guess do you think that higher rate is sustainable and just kind of what you think about that for the back half of the year thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer yes that s good question again listen cp is a business that again we i think we talked about it in on the previous calls we ve been investing in that business relative to organic growth now to support our objective to deliver low single digit growth i would say cp is going to be a low single digit growth producer clearly we were pleased with 3 in a quarter but we saw from a range of product lines inside that category containers bottles pharmaceutical healthcare our vials business we re all strong in the quarter and we re really pleased with the pace of progress from those teams and the pipeline that s ultimately they re executing against that will benefit us not only here in 2020 but certainly 21 and beyond this is a strategic commitment and objective for our company to deliver the growth and we re applying the right resources toward the right target investments to make it happen and the fact that we saw growth across such a diverse number of segments gives us a great deal of confidence and what we re doing in cp north america is the same thing that we re doing in deploying in the acquisition of rpc making certain that we re prioritizing our investments where we can further stimulate growth where we can expedite and speed the pace of growth in businesses that we believe we have a sustainable differentiated advantage the same model that we re applying across all the businesses tyler langton jpmorgan analyst great thanks so much operator our next question comes from the line of brian maguire from goldman sachs your line is open brian maguire goldman sachs analyst hey good morning just wanted to come back to some of the differences in volumes between north america and international consumer and i guess europe in general and i know tom you said that you re not seeing any real impact from the sustainability conversation but i guess the question is really why do you think so much of the weakness that you re seeing in volumes is taking place in europe right now i know there are economies may be a little bit slower than in the us but seems like the consumers may be holding up all right just wondered if you could talk about if you are seeing like more pronounced de stocking there or things like brexit have any impact and then just sort of related it that if 30 of that consumer international business is sort of more industrial facing maybe why not put that in the em segment or break it out a little bit separately because it does seem like a lot of the volume weakness you re calling out are more industrial and cyclical markets than truly the more stable consumer markets we re used to seeing thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer so i would say that volume you know how we ultimately pivot products in given segments it s something that we look at on a regular basis actually we did some of that when we first bought rpc by moving some of the north american businesses from international to our north american side of cp as you said that 30 tied into things like automotive and if you look at the major economies in europe relative to automotive demand think about germany think about the uk think about spain you ve got economic softness in those regions i believe that it s transitory and we continue to believe though this business will be a low single digit grower and it s really about there were pockets of de stocking or softness tied the personal care and you ve heard others mentioned that we saw some of that as well but by no means is this a component that we re losing share to other substrates i reiterate this is not about us losing share to other substrate this is about transitory macro softness specific to our industrial based businesses brian maguire goldman sachs analyst okay and then just a separate question on capital reallocation priorities this call and others you guys have highlighted the free cash flow yield i think you think that s an attractive valuation metric yes and the priority has clearly been to repair the balance sheet and delever but with the stock under pressure again any thoughts on maybe delaying the deleveraging process and restarting the buyback authorization is that something that s on the table thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer our priorities are clear what we say we re going to delever the company get our leverage back below 4 times and ultimately deliver on our commitments relative to growth along with the predictable free cash flow which is over 900 million on a normalized basis and i think things will take care of themselves this business now with the ability for us to deliver value on a global basis and with the diversity of our portfolio with the strength of the sustainability capability we have both from a design as well as the use of post consumer chemically recycled mechanically recycled materials and our ability to ultimately interface with our end users to the degree we are to support waste reduction in a circular economy is frankly a very strong value proposition we announced yesterday a partnership with georgia pacific further reiterating our ability to support the circular economy where we ll ultimately take recycled materials from georgia pacific we ll ultimately reintroduce those into new products again demonstrating our ability to deliver on that commitment to reduce plastics waste to take advantage of available raw material and resource and we have the ability to partner with key end users and partners like a georgia pacific with all the end users that we serve throughout the market we re doing this as an example and what was announced yesterday we re doing this in the e commerce space and there s a lot more to come this is an incredibly dynamic time and we re thrilled to be part of the narrative brian maguire goldman sachs analyst okay thanks very much operator our next question comes from the line of arun viswanathan from rbc capital markets your line is open thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer next question operator our next question comes from the line of mike leithead from barclays your line is open mike leithead barclays analyst thanks good morning guys thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer good morning mike leithead barclays analyst i guess first on the resin side we ve been hearing from the resin producers about greater discounting in the us market just given the new supply there i know you re already quite a big buyer in that market but i was curious if you re seeing any incremental impact from greater resin discounting in the market today thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer listen the majority resin for us is ostensibly a pass through clearly what i would what i think is most pertinent is that we see continued stability in the commodities market unlike that we ve seen in the in the prior years and that stability ultimately is a plus as you re all aware there s been significant investment made in north america relative to polyolefins and clearly it supports frankly from a cost perspective the value of this material versus other substrates so i think it s more of that we re seeing not only in resin but frankly other raw materials as well as freight greater stability this year than we saw last year for sure mike leithead barclays analyst got it that s helpful and then i was hoping you could provide a like on like volume number for the consumer international business for the quarter but i think that was the one saying when i didn t see a volume number for in the release mark w miles chief financial officer sure it was down approximately 3 year over year mike leithead barclays analyst got it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of anojja shah from bmo capital markets your line is open anojja shah bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning i wanted to go back to this georgia pacific announcement you made yesterday on recycling plastics is this similar to what rpc is already doing in europe and can recycling plastic waste eventually be a profit center for berry thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer we re not doing this just as a public service we believe any opportunity to monetize these opportunities to recycle materials to eliminate plastics waste given berry scale number of facilities and ability to reclaim and reprocess as unique value proposition so yes we ll look to continue to replicate this the differences and it s similar what we do in rpc not exactly the same but the project with georgia pacific is just very unique that you re taking an experience company in the recycling industry the opportunity to collaborate and partner with them to remove these materials from the landfill reincorporate them in new products is an exceptional opportunity and we clearly believe that from a scale perspective that is a competitive advantage for us because we have the end use relationships the number of manufacturing and converting sites to ultimately execute in and against it your comment relative to rpc again though in terms of what they re doing from recycling we re learning a ton from them they clearly when we bought them we re further ahead from a sustainability perspective and the opportunities to steal the best practices from them and explore other opportunities that we can participate in the circular economy whether it s chemical recycling mechanical recycling it s something we re really encouraged by and frankly rpc has helped enable that for us anojja shah bmo capital markets analyst great thank you and then for my follow up question sorry if i missed that but just can you talk about foodservice volumes in consumer packaging in the quarter and also what you re seeing in foodservice relative for the battle between plastics fiber and other alternatives thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer foodservice continues to be a strong performer it similarly supported the positive growth in the quarter and i would only argue that the success of that business over the last two years has been driven by substrate conversion in our favor anojja shah bmo capital markets analyst okay great thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of kyle white from deutsche bank your line is open kyle white deutsche bank analyst hey good morning everyone thanks for taking my question just following up on the georgia pacific announcement and the talk on post consumer resin curious how much post consumer resin you currently use and where you think that could go in the next few years and then on top of that are you finding that customers i think we can all agree that the brands are wanting to become more sustainable but are you finding that customers are actually willing to pay up to use this kind of material versus virgin thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer our percentage of used in terms of post consumer material is relative to our overall spend it was up on a year over year basis but it s still a relatively smaller percentage of our overall spend from a raw material perspective i will tell you that discussion and conversation with end users is better more collaborative more balanced than it s ever been the both i think converters like ourselves as well as end users are balancing not only supply but ultimately determining what the best sustainable designs will be for them going forward and i think this is going to continue to materialize throughout the course of the year but it is it s very encouraging the level of dialogue and the percentage of time that we re spending collaborating with our end users on how we can meet their sustainability objectives reducing plastics waste reducing waste to landfill and supporting our objective and certainly our commitment to end plastics waste of eliminating plastic waste and it s been very positive i ve been doing this a lot of years and the dialogue is more actionable and better than ever before we at berry believe that our ability to educate around designing for sustainability and the alternatives that are available to our end customers are real clearly right now there is a disparity between virgin cost and recycled cost but over time as demand continues to increase that will level set and frankly some are challenging themselves to take on the responsibility and pass that cost forward so we ll see it s going to continue evolve over time but i will tell you it s not just it s just not commitments on paper the discussions are active and they re actionable and i expect to see that number in terms of post consumer usage and demand increase as well as the objectives to overall weight reduce which berry is similarly an industry leader and our ability to reduce and take weight out of our plastic parts kyle white deutsche bank analyst got it that s helpful and then just a quick one if i look at the normalized free cash flow the 900 million can you just help me bridge the 800 million this year that you re guiding to the normalized 900 million i guess if i layer on the additional 75 million of synergies kind of tax effect us and then take out the working capital and other headwinds that you had this year i get to a little bit higher number but i understand this pricing level conservatism mark w miles chief financial officer no that s the exact math yeah just taking the 800 million adding back the unrealized synergy as well as eliminating the integration costs associated with rpc and tax affecting those kyle white deutsche bank analyst all right thank you good luck in the year mark w miles chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of salvator tiano from vertical your line is open salvator tiano vertical analyst yeah hi tom mark and dustin firstly a little bit of a big picture question you kind of addressed it talking about convergence in foodservice to plastics but just a big picture when we go back a few years ago there are many many years in a row with the negative volumes and now you re on a very sustainable path two years roughly positive growth can you tell us a little bit what you ve done on your end to change the business the segment and what has changed with regard to the end markets not just foodservice and i guess plastic cups but broadly that has led to this growth trajectory thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer yeah happy too i think strategically you have to go back and realize that often times historically when we would do acquisitions we would call volume or walk away from volume because it may not have met our margin expectations the business for consumer packaging north america hasn t been impacted by an acquisition for the last seven five or seven years or so so it s really been operating on its own and our focus was identifying which opportunity we could create differentiation and then invest behind the differentiation and as a result it has paid dividends for us not only in foodservice but in our specialty bottles business and our farm and healthcare business and we re making similar investments to support our already leading position and closures and vials and we ll continue to do that and i think it s a all investments are not considered equal and we really are making tough decisions to make certain that the investments we make are absolutely on the right opportunities no different than what we ve done inside of hhs to support growth in a faster growing region like china with our high loss soft material and in our five investments which remains on track and will be sold out by the end of 2020 salvator tiano vertical analyst great and just as a follow up i wanted to see a little bit the impact of light weighting in engineered materials and health hygiene and specialties i think historically given how you count volumes on a resin basis light weighting consumer packaging has been a headwind to the reported volumes as we look more as we look to make more sustainable products will this have a measurable impacted the way you report the volumes in these segments thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer it s a fair commentary there s not a perfect unit to measure inside our business but we re not doing this just to affect the metric the reality is if we can make products better more cost effective meeting the feature needs and benefits for our end customers we will do it we re doing at engineered materials by our expertise at material science we re doing in hhs by our ability to combine non wovens with breathable film technology a compliment of the most recent clopay acquisition but yes it s an ongoing effort to define the best unit of measurement that can best reflect the progress that we re making toward growth and we ll continue to seek out what those are but there is not a perfect one in our business given the diversity of what we do salvator tiano vertical analyst great thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of gabe hajde from wells fargo securities your line is open gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst good morning gentlemen thanks for taking the question to revisit the china commentary tom that you made specific to hh s notwithstanding any ripple effect that i guess this virus may have on the economy or sentiment should we interpret that that it would be a net positive to volumes in hh s to the extent that this persists thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer i would i think it s too early to say that it s going to be a net positive the two plants that are manufacturing the majority of those materials are nanhai facility and suzhou facility but it s just it s a little too early to say what that will be it all really depends how long this health crisis lasts in some instances we re ultimately deferring the production of other materials to support the healthcare product to support the need that both china and the world economy has relative to shortages in those product lines i ll say none of our plants right now are ultimately closed so there s a variety of facilities no they are continue to serve local markets i think we ll continue to serve the local chinese market people need to continue to eat people need to continue to do those things that they do to support their everyday life as a component of our overall portfolio but a little too soon to say i m just proud of our team s ability to provide these kind of products ultimately to meet what is an unfortunate demand right now gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst no understood you ve made a couple of comments in the past couple of quarters about the dispensing systems business within the acquired rpc operations i was curious if now you ve had a couple of quarters to look underneath the tent here where that business had historically been successful and what type of investment might be necessary to expand it is this a function of really installing some assembly equipment here or maybe domestically and maybe even something where you can co locate operations and then i guess get some commercial folks in place or what timeline or anything you can give us on that front would be helpful thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer yeah it s one of the most attractive parts of the rpc acquisition combining rpc s closure dispensing business with berry s creates close to 2 billion business for berry and the team right now is prioritizing around their innovation pipeline to get it commercialized as quickly as possible secondly where they have commercialized around pharmaceutical around healthcare how we can deploy those existing application and parts to other regions of the world so it s really part of the of that global value delivery capability that we are hyper focused on i will say in general the level of investment to support this business was outstanding from an automation perspective from a converting equipment perspective it s really about making certain that we get more of that pipeline commercialized faster consistent with what we talked about in our overall strategy which is investing in an advantage products and targeted markets and deploying the resources and capital against it but we re excited about that business and that is a our objective clearly is to be a global leader in closures and dispensing solutions gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst great thank you for that and last one if i can squeeze in can you remind us on the i guess versalite product given the decline in polypropylene is that more of a cost competitive product now and something that you still having dialogue with customers on for hot cup applications thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer we continue to have questions we continue to enjoy business we ve made great strides relative to the cost of that substrate our portfolio of customers that enjoy today in our pipeline is robust i ll leave it at that and it s robust with the majors so we continue to believe it s one of the world s most advanced drink cup solutions and our existing customers continue to enjoy its benefit and there s a pipeline of new opportunity for us to consider gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst thank you good luck operator our next question comes from the line of adam josephson from keybanc your line is open adam josephson keybanc analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions i appreciate it mark just one on rpc volumes i know you said they were slightly down in the two quarters you ve owned them can you just give us some context as to what they ve been i think they were flat in the quarter to beforehand and then they had been i think growing low single digits over the past few years if memory serves can you just talk to us about what our rpc s volume trends have been over the past few years because i know the european economy is not great but it has it s been in a malaise for many years now so i m just i guess trying to understand what if anything has changed from the days when rpc was up low single digits thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer sure yeah i think adam the progression i think you laid it out pretty accurately plus 1 plus 2 and as a reminder they reported every six months so quarter to quarter i don t know that i ve look at closely to figure out volatility within the quarter so i hesitate getting too excited about one quarter s performance but yes starting under various ownership first q1 or two quarters in first quarter was flat this quarter was down 3 so for the first six months we re essentially flat down 1 on volumes then i wouldn t say there s been any significant change other than what we called out weakness in some of the european markets here in the most recent quarter but again as we pointed out too early to call how long this will last we just want to be prudent in our approach and call out that it is weaker at the moment but that could certainly change as the clock roils forward adam josephson keybanc analyst sure and just one on resin mark i know you mentioned year over year prices are down quite a bit it flew through your sales line how much of a benefit to your ebitda was resin in the quarter and what if any changes are you expecting on resin prices polypro and polyethylene for the balance of the fiscal year and just what s your outlook on supply demand in those markets mark w miles chief financial officer yeah as a reminder of resin is a pass through for us so the fact that resin is down year over year has reflected in a lower top line but that s also a lower price for our customers right so it makes our products less expensive for our customers so in terms of impact on our profitability not that significant as it pass through to our customers in terms of outlook i think tom may have mentioned this in some earlier answers but it s been relatively stable up down up 0 01 or 0 02 a month but it s been a pretty stable market here in the recent history adam josephson keybanc analyst and you are expecting no change for the balance of the fiscal year i assume in your guidance along those lines mark w miles chief financial officer yeah we re expecting a relatively stable market for resin going forward which on cash flow i should point out as well that would be a modest tailwind to the extent resin does stay benign but again early in the year so we re not adjusting at this stage adam josephson keybanc analyst perfect thank you mark mark w miles chief financial officer thank you operator our last question comes from the line of george staphos from boa your line is open george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi guys thanks for taking the follow on to late i ll make it quick can you let us know or remind us what are the next one or two steps relative to any new materials requalifying and filling the pipeline in line with your targets to hit your guidance and or within your guidance and then relately could remind us what s in the 150 million of spending for this segment over the next three years what are you basically when it s all said and done what will that segment look like how ll it be different how ll it be more competitive so on so forth thank you guys good luck in the quarter thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer sure the onboarding remains on track we ve completed over 50 of the new opportunities that have become commercialized we ll do the remaining 50 here in this quarter and into the june quarter to kind of round out the whole year the good news george it s not cast in stone so it s very dynamic and we continue to add to that pipeline and that ultimately is what we re most excited about that they continue to add onto the pipeline side of engineered material that gives us support for beyond 2020 we are making investments inside that business just to make certain that we ve got the tactical app to know how from everything to support more automation inside that business so that we ultimately can prioritize our human capital around the most value added applications inside of the business to support some which i can t describe specifically converting technologies that will give us advantages relative to composition of products materials science and the overall cost of conversion inside that space george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you very much operator i would now like to turn the call back to the company for final comments thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer very good i want to thank everybody for your interest in our

the nonpartisan congressional budget office issued yet another warning tuesday that the federal government is heading down a dangerous fiscal path racking up debt at an alarming rate the cbo projects that deficits will average 1 3 trillion a year over the coming decade with the economy settling into steady but sluggish growth that s the most disturbing thing about the report the expectation that giant deficits will be allowed to continue even when there s no recession driving up spending on federal safety net programs and causing tax revenue to plummet the nonpartisan congressional budget office issued yet another warning tuesday that the federal government is heading down a dangerous fiscal path racking up debt at an alarming rate the cbo projects that deficits will average 1 3 trillion a year over the coming decade with the economy settling into steady but sluggish growth that s the most disturbing thing about the report the expectation that giant deficits will be allowed to continue even when there s no recession driving up spending on federal safety net programs and causing tax revenue to plummet it s not inherently bad for the federal government to borrow money extra spending by the government can help stimulate the economy during a downturn but sustained and heavy deficit spending can have the opposite effect raising borrowing costs and slowing gdp growth the cbo projects that the fastest growing part of the federal budget will be interest payments on the rising debt spending that delivers no tangible benefit for taxpayers while leaving less money for programs that do advertising rising health care costs and an aging population are contributing to the federal budget mess but the problem has been exacerbated by the large and irresponsible tax cuts republicans pushed through in 2017 the cuts were sold as a way to trigger a sustained surge in economic growth instead gdp bumped up only briefly held back in part by the tariffs president trump slapped on a broad array of imports we ve seen this movie before some supposed fiscal conservatives will demand more tax cuts to try to jump start faster growth in fact trump and house republicans floated just such an idea before the 2018 election and again last year others will blame the problem on federal spending and demand cuts not to the military and security programs that trump has vastly expanded not to the vast tax giveaways and subsidies but to the safety net programs the administration is already trying to restrain slashing programs such as medicaid and food stamps to help pay for the gop tax cuts would be redistributing wealth in the worst way from the impoverished to the well to do the right answer starts with lawmakers rolling back the tax cut and spending excesses of the trump administration they can then work on a longer term plan to bring spending and revenue back into line los angeles times
hong kong china may have to cut taxes boost spending and slash interest rates to prevent the coronavirus outbreak wreaking havoc on an already fragile economy the economic impact of the virus is still impossibleto determine but one state media outlet and some economists have said that china s growth rate could drop two percentage points this quarter because of the outbreak which has brought large parts of the country to a standstill a decline on that scale could mean 62 billion rs9 574 billion in lost growth international media reported china can ill afford that kind of hit growth last year was already the country s weakest in nearly three decades as china contended with rising debt and the fallout from its trade war with the united states the coronavirus which first appeared in the central city of wuhan has already killed more than 200 people and infected more people than the sars outbreak in 2003 a disease of this magnitude wasn t even on china s radar before the outbreak the government was more worried that social unrest could be its black swan problem an improbable but chaotic event officials feared could be spurred by rising unemployment now beijing is scrambling to stop the virus from cratering its economy the ruling communist party recently put premier li keqiang in charge of virus control the decision was a clear signal that stopping the virus is the priority among priorities for the government right now the official people s daily newspaper wrote in a recent commentary so far policymakers have taken some steps to help the businesses that are most affected central and local governments have allocated 12 6 billion so far to spend on medical treatment and equipment major banks have cut interest rates for small businesses and individuals in the worst hit areas and the bank of china said it would allow people in wuhan and the rest of hubei province to delay their loan payments for several months the people s bank of china the country s central bank has said that it will ensure there is enough liquidity in the financial markets when they reopen next monday after a 10 day lunar new year holiday when hong kong s markets reopened earlier this week the hang seng index hsi plunged nearly 6 in just a few days of trading more than a dozen chinese provinces announced an extension of the lunar new year holiday by more than a week fourteen provinces and cities have said businesses need not start operations until at least the second week of february they accounted for almost 69 of china s gross domestic product in 2019 international media reported all the key eastern manufacturing provinces have extended the holiday they include guangdong home to the tech city of shenzhen across the border from hong kong shanghai home to china s largest port and a newly built tesla inc plant as well as jiangsu where nike shoes are manufactured henan in central china which has a large foxconn plant making iphones also announced the extended break the extension come on top of other measures including quarantining whole cities that are set to disrupt supply chains and logistics the longer holiday is also likely to be disruptive for china s trade hitting both exports imports and the companies that rely on that exchange the 14 provinces included in the extended holiday were the source of 78 of china s exports in december last year according to bloomberg calculations based on official data those same provinces account for 90 of copper smelting at least 60 of steel production 65 of crude oil refining and 40 of coal output

the following is the presentation by mary alice waters who spoke as part of a panel discussion in guangzhou china one of some 50 during the 10th international conference of issco the international society for the study of chinese overseas the conference was held nov 8 11 2019 at jinan university see news article in issue no 47 in 2019 waters is president of pathfinder press and editor of our history is still being written the story of three chinese cuban generals in the cuban revolution by armando choy gustavo chui and moisés sío wong the title of her presentation was cultural diplomatic and trade ties between the people s republic of china and cuba today participating in the audience were cuba s consul general in guangzhou denisse llamos infante and consul hansel e díaz laborde copyright 2020 by pathfinder press reprinted by permission sixty years ago in cuba a century of revolutionary struggle against spanish colonialism and u s imperialist domination culminated in a victorious socialist revolution it was a deep going popular revolution millions of working people of all ages both men and women transformed themselves as they fought for independence for sovereignty for dignity and began to transform their society in face of military aggression and economic sabotage by washington supported by other imperialist powers workers and peasants in cuba defended and deepened their initial conquests they established a government and a state of their own one that advanced the interests of those who had been the most oppressed and exploited layers of the population they ended capitalist ownership of the land mills factories and banks they gave land to the peasants who worked it they outlawed discrimination based on race in all public facilities they organized millions of women into employment and social and political activity with a popular mobilization involving hundreds of thousands of young people they went to the mountains working class barrios and rural areas eradicating illiteracy across cuba in less than one year they armed the workers and farmers and organized them into disciplined militia units to defend the country they were building on new economic and social foundations and against all odds for more than six decades cuban working people have successfully held at bay the most powerful empire the world will ever see cubans of chinese descent for cubans of chinese descent the consequences of these historic conquests have been unprecedented one thing distinguishes the economic and the social conditions of life today for cubans of chinese origin from chinese communities everywhere else in the world that is the near total absence of discrimination or prejudice against chinese cubans and their descendants that unique condition is a stunning fact most of you in this room know well from your own experiences the countless forms of anti chinese prejudice elsewhere in the world that alone would justify a closer look at the cuban revolution in cuba there are no typically chinese occupations anymore whether it s restaurants or laundries or small shopkeepers or families growing vegetables and fruits for urban markets there s no glass ceiling no field of endeavor or level of leadership responsibility beyond which no one of chinese ancestry will be found whether it s government ministries leaders of mass organizations of the cuban revolution generals artists scientists or whatever esteban lazo president of the national assembly of cuba is a cuban of chinese african descent lázaro barredo until recently the longtime editor in chief of granma the daily newspaper of the communist party of cuba is a cuban of chinese descent wifredo lam among the world renowned artists of the 20th century was a cuban of african chinese descent who wove threads from those cultures into the richness of his paintings another example one i ll be drawing on today since i happen to know it best is the three generals of cuba s revolutionary armed forces moisés sío wong gustavo chui and armando choy their stories are available including here at the conference in the book our history is still being written published in english spanish chinese farsi and just this week now in french as well capitalists divide and rule the lessons of the cuban revolution are especially important in today s world of deepening capitalist crisis because chauvinism and xenophobia are weapons of choice wielded by the ruling classes to try to divide working people and turn us against each other they try to convince us our problems come not from those who exploit us but from immigrants who take our jobs or neighbors whose skin color or religion is different from ours this is a history that overseas chinese know well what s happening today in asia in america in europe in africa is not new overseas chinese for centuries have been a prime target of attacks against foreigners from the more subtle forms of discrimination and race hatred to mob violence exclusion laws and pogroms this is the context in which the example of cuba stands out the impact of this history on chinese living abroad is highlighted in the foreword by wang lusha to pathfinder s 2017 edition of our history is still being written wang is the young tv and film scriptwriter who translated the book into chinese as a university student he studied in new zealand and the netherlands in the foreword he describes encountering anti chinese discrimination and prejudice for the first time while living in these countries and the feelings of inferiority it gave him but one man changed my way of thinking wang writes and that man was general moisés sío wong just by chance as wang explains he came across sío wong s name surfing the internet and read that he was a general of the revolutionary armed forces of cuba and an adviser to then cuban vice president raúl castro wang says he thought such a thing was impossible it couldn t be true so he started trying to find out more about moisés sío wong and in the process a friend in christchurch new zealand gave him a copy of our history is still being written i felt overwhelmed as i read through the pages wang noted discovering that there were many chinese in cuba in addition to general sío wong who made remarkable contributions learning about the chinese in cuba wang writes restored his self confidence and pride in being born chinese no more chinese in cuba the history of chinese in cuba is not the topic of my presentation today but for those of you to whom this is all new that story began in 1847 when over the next quarter century more than 140 000 chinese indentured laborers were shipped to cuba as part of what was known as the coolie trade they worked on cuba s booming sugar plantations under conditions very close to slavery many deserted the cane fields joined the mambises the liberation army fighting for independence from spain and stayed in cuba where they became part of the cuban working people you will often hear it said in cuba that the cuban nationality was forged one third spanish one third african and one third chinese chinese immigration to cuba ebbed and flowed for a century by the 1930s the barrio chino in havana was second in the western hemisphere only to san francisco s chinatown in size and cultural life it was the largest in all of latin america as elsewhere the chinese population in cuba rapidly became class divided it included peddlers laborers laundry workers and peasants but by the 20th century there were also rich landlords owners of department stores and large restaurants and clubs bankers and others of great wealth according to cuba s 1899 census by that time there were 42 chinese sugar plantation owners in the united states it s not unusual to be told there are no longer any chinese in cuba that they all left with the victory of the revolution like so much else said about cuba in the u s that s simply false from 1959 to 1968 the plantation owners bankers and well to do merchants having tried and failed to save the u s backed batista dictatorship or establish some other bourgeois regime did flee the country that s true but tens of thousands of cubans of chinese descent were among the millions of cubans who joined workers militias drove organized crime out of havana s chinatown and repelled the u s instigated invasion at the bay of pigs in 1961 they and their descendants are everywhere in cuba today in all occupations all you have to do is walk the streets of any city in cuba to see the chinese characteristics in face after face the truth is obvious people s republic of china i want to focus my remaining time on the main subject of my presentation here some of the turning points in the political economic and diplomatic relations between the people s republic of china and cuba over the last 60 years and the different political and class starting points that have marked those relations when the revolutionary movement led by fidel castro took power at the opening of the 1960s the new government immediately reached out to china they identified with the victorious anti imperialist struggles of the chinese people that led to the establishment of the people s republic of china in 1949 in september 1960 cuba became the first latin america country to recognize what the capitalist rulers called red china defying washington s economic blackmail which kept every other country in the americas aligned for decades with taiwan in a reciprocal way as u s government attacks on the cuban revolution escalated beijing stepped in with assistance much needed shipments of rice above all before the revolution most rice consumed in cuba had been imported from the united states that trade was abruptly ended in the early 1960s as part of washington s near total cutoff of economic and financial relations with cuba china s aid was greatly appreciated but the opening years of the cuban revolution also coincided with rapidly deepening divisions between the governments of china and the union of soviet socialist republics what became known as the sino soviet conflict the cuban leadership led an impassioned political battle to convince both moscow and beijing to put aside factional interests and come together to support the vietnamese national liberation struggle in face of the murderous war being waged by washington and its imperialist allies che guevara s famous call in 1966 to create two three many vietnams in solidarity with the vietnamese struggle is well known in late 1965 in an effort by the chinese government to pressure the cuban leadership to line up with it as opposed to moscow beijing abruptly slashed almost by half its emergency rice shipments to cuba fidel castro issued a scathing public response in a february 1966 statement published by prensa latina castro called the chinese leadership s action a display of absolute contempt toward our country and the dignity of our people in a public speech in havana a month later he said chinese government officials had introduced the style of absolute monarchies into contemporary socialist revolutions forgotten the marxist truth that it is not individual men but people who write history and made a god of mao tse tung as the so called cultural revolution unfolded in china in the late 1960s the cuban leadership was horrified by its destructive course by its devastation of culture and education and by its violent factionalism and adventurism copied and practiced by pro maoist parties everywhere including in latin america cuban leaders considered the factional divisions created by this beijing fostered course to be one of the factors that led to the defeat in 1967 of the bolivian guerrilla front led by che guevara and to che s death in combat the cultural revolution played out with consequences in cuba as well as chinese cubans who backed the mao leadership briefly gained control of the chung wah casino in havana the main chinese association in the country before some of them abandoned revolutionary cuba for the people s republic of china in 1968 although the two governments never broke diplomatic ties relations between them had gone into a deep freeze by the last half of the 60s a situation that lasted for close to a quarter century those were years during which the governments of cuba and the prc confronted each other on opposite sides of the barricades in decisive international class battles key among these clashes was the blood drenched 1973 coup in chile after which beijing developed close ties with the military dictatorship including two state visits to the prc by gen augusto pinochet other conflicts included beijing s 1979 invasion of vietnam along its northern border which was denounced by the cuban government and cuba s internationalist mission to help turn back the south african apartheid regime s u s backed invasions of angola in the 1970s and 80s during which the chinese regime aided counterrevolutionary angolan forces aligned with pretoria and washington new relations open a new stage of relations between the two governments opened at the end of the 1980s with the fall of the meringue as cuban president fidel castro called the collapse of regimes in the soviet union and eastern europe that had paraded as socialist virtually overnight cuba lost 85 percent of its foreign trade bringing agriculture industry transportation and other economic activity to a crashing halt the resulting economic and political crisis is known in cuba as the special period these momentous shocks coincided with another watershed the events of tiananmen square in spring 1989 in face of large youth mobilizations demanding political and economic reforms the chinese government declared martial law and used the people s liberation army to put an end to the protests killing countless numbers amid the near total isolation of beijing internationally the cuban leadership supported the actions by the chinese leadership fidel called them regrettable and said they were poorly handled with inexperience perhaps but that the chinese leadership had no alternative in 1993 for the first time ever the chinese president jiang zemin visited cuba and cuban president fidel castro reciprocated with a trip to china for the first time ever in 1995 the chinese government also began providing vital emergency economic aid to cuba even today cubans talk about the half million chinese bicycles that became one of the most widely used means of transportation in those years that welcome development was soon followed by a bicycle factory built with chinese equipment and aid that was managed by the ujc the union of communist youth by some reports the chinese government extended over a billion dollars in loans to cuba during the 1990s some of the interest and principal was later written down as terms were renegotiated in 2011 but substantial yearly payments are still rigorously adhered to by the cuban government as important as china s aid to cuba was however it pales in comparison with chinese investments elsewhere in latin america including a reported 65 billion to venezuela between 2005 and 2017 according to recent reports china has announced plans to increase overall investments in latin america to 250 billion by 2025 trade as a whole between latin america and china amounts to roughly 260 billion a year today only 2 billion of that is with cuba the point i want to emphasize however is that these trade ties and loans have nothing to do with international solidarity they are strictly based on market relations and profit maximization for the lender investment in infrastructure projects like ports and railroads is everywhere tied to the purchase of chinese equipment and materials and is financed in large part by loans to be paid in full and on time that s the basis of beijing s famous belt and road initiative as sío wong was fond of saying our chinese friends don t give anything to anyone in the capitalist world some academic experts on the cuban revolution gleefully if inaccurately joke that china has become cuba s international monetary fund meanwhile despite many signed memoranda of understanding with beijing pledges of cooperation and friendship and reciprocal trade delegations back and forth most major projects in cuba have yet to materialize that s the case as of now with regard to funds to revitalize nickel production in eastern cuba modernize the oil refinery in cienfuegos and build luxury hotels and golf courses on prime real estate the policy of china s leadership has been explicit throughout to bring pressure to bear on the cuban leadership to meet its international debt payments and to adopt china s example of market socialism it can more accurately be called capitalism with chinese characteristics if i can adapt a phrase from deng xiaoping end us economic war on cuba let me close on one point the depth of the economic crisis facing cuban toilers today is no secret to any of us it s severe as cuban foreign minister bruno rodríguez told more than 1 000 participants at an international solidarity conference in havana in early november i feel it is my duty to tell you that hard times are ahead of us the brutally grinding and never ending economic strangulation of the cuban toilers by u s imperialism takes a heavy cumulative toll on a people whose crime is their refusal to become vassals of u s imperialism once again there are today in cuba significant shortages of personal hygiene products with the consequences we know that has for one s dignity and sense of well being diesel fuel medicines gas for cooking as well as many food products are difficult to obtain and washington is once again tightening the economic noose seeking every way to choke off vitally needed imports and foreign currency it s an old story we ve all lost count how many times over the last 60 years under both republican and democratic administrations the pendulum has swung in this direction in fact most often the ratcheting up of economic pressure has been carried out under democratic party leadership if you follow the bourgeois media whether mass or social all you hear is that the difficulties facing cuban working people are the inevitable result of six decades of efforts to advance along a socialist course in defiance of what capitalists consider to be human nature that is dog eat dog greed and exploitation whatever mistakes and false steps have been made by the cuban leadership and they are the first to acknowledge them it s not hard to imagine what cuba once among the most economically developed countries of capitalist latin america would be like today if it had not been for washington s 60 years of economic strangulation cuba s new guidelines for social and economic policy adopted in 2011 after extensive nationwide debate as well as the new constitution that went into effect earlier this year are a recognition of the consequences of imperialism s decadeslong war the cuban government has had to introduce greater space for market relations in cuba but the lesson is not the inevitable bankruptcy of socialism it s the opposite what emerges from this history is the capacity of working people in cuba to make and defend their revolution since 1959 in face of this unrelenting assault by u s imperialism the surprise is not that they are forced to make a retreat it s the enduring example of what is possible when the working class and its allies take power transforming themselves as they fight to transform the world i will end by quoting the words of sío wong at an issco conference like this one that took place in havana in 1999 in the pages of our history is still being written sío wong recounts an exchange he had at that event with issco s founding president wang gungwu how is it possible wang asked sío wong that you a descendant of chinese occupy a high government post are a deputy in the national assembly and a general of the armed forces how is that possible sío wong answered the difference is that here a socialist revolution took place a revolution that eliminated the economic foundations on which discrimination based on the color of a person s skin has been founded a revolution that established a government that has been used by working people to fight all forms of discrimination and prejudice to historians and others who want to study the question sío wong concluded i say that you have to understand that the chinese community here in cuba is different from peru brazil argentina or canada and that difference is the triumph of a socialist revolution that remains the lesson of cuba for us today

pick two or three themes from the budget that you think will really give a stimulus to the economy what would they be according to analysis by economists and policy experts if private investment is not picking up where does the buck stop the buck stops at the government s doors the government will have to show that it is not waiting for private investments to happen that will happen when it has to happen but we have to go about investing and that s what we made very clear saying yes we will invest and in infrastructure i want to put out some things to strengthen this point the prime minister announced this during his independence day speech that 100 lakh crore will be spent on infrastructure over five years soon after that we had a task force and we looked into details we consulted states and the private sector and came up with the pipeline of 6 500 projects within four months we were able to come out with a complete pipeline of projects and in this budget we are helping that pipeline see the light of the day i have given enough concessions for sovereign funds that want to come into india but with the added condition that you invest in infrastructure we have already given 22 000 crore for companies that will handhold and direct investments towards these pipeline projects we are also investing in inland water connectivity projects with all this i want to say the expectation that money should be spent in creating assets a focus visible in the budget is the rural economy and agriculture where you have pledged to spend 2 83 lakh crore in the 16 point action plan how will you work with the states and in the context of agriculture how do you see it addressing problems in backward and forward linkage if you look at the 16 points as a continuum you will see it has been created keeping backward and forward linkages in mind and in it the work that needs to be done in agriculture and the work that needs to be done in agriculture allied areas all these areas involve a specific role for the youth and to give them the requisite skills skill development authorities have already held several discussions with multiple states this is why i am saying that the planning for this budget did not start in the last three weeks it began in july so when it comes to youth or allied industries they follow a principled direction when you look at the rural economy one of the things that seem to have helped this year was the job guarantee scheme mnrega you originally budgeted 60 000 crore but ended up spending close to 71 000 crore this year the budget estimates are lower than that are you expecting enough of a pick up in rural jobs and rural economy to offset this or will you step in and invest more when a need arises the principle behind the mnrega is that when the need arises we will give it but if you notice in my budget speech i have also mentioned the scheme will be extended for fodder creation because today livestock in many of the water distressed districts don t even have fodder maintaining livestock is becoming an issue if it is possible for us to use many of those not so fertile land i wouldn t say they are barren to cultivate fodder your local livestock will survive on it and that itself can be one of the mnrega activities so we have tried to tie up some loose ends with the scheme one of the other things where there has been a reduction from last year s budget estimates is food subsidies the fact that you also ended up spending less than what you budgeted last year suggests a capacity utilisation or an implementation problem it can also be seasonal sometimes when people are migrating and the interoperability that we are bringing in it can be due to that i don t think i will be able to put my finger on what specifically caused it but it is not a conscious reduction from our side on direct taxation what compelled you to create the new slabs for income tax and now for individual tax payers what will be a better option in your opinion the idea behind this move was to make tax filing easier and simpler for the people they should be able to understand what the tax burden on them is exactly the myriad of exemptions 120 exemptions that have piled up over the decades also creates a problem of revenue estimation for the tax department moreover as a taxpayer a person needs to turn to a professional to understand what exemptions they should use our belief was that ultimately tax should be simpler and the burden lighter this is why i can say that from now we are beginning on a path to reduce exemptions while also lowering the rate the total saving because of reduced tax will be high in the new scheme i have also asked the revenue secretary to issue a clarification note today itself that even in the new scheme four new exemptions have been added because we do not want to tax the savings people already have justifiable simple straight forward exemptions have been added to the new system so the idea is over a period of time all exemptions will go yes we want to remove gradually everything called exemptions i am not waiting for a golden day to do it but have started the process by offering a new stream i am not forcing people you can continue to be where you want to claim exemptions but gradually when exemptions go i will also give an attractive rate do you think the tax changes that you made will be significant enough to impact consumption yes i am giving you an example a person with a salary of 15 lakh per annum will save 78 000 and he will have to use that money either in savings or in consumption so what about the fear that some people have that savings are gone altogether i don t want to believe that a taxpayer will have to be goaded to save a taxpayer is smart enough intelligent enough responsible enough to take a call on how much he wants to spend or save we should trust him to that extent on the tax issue the new charter appears to be the first time a government has gone out and said that taxpayers have the right to not be harassed can you tell us a little bit about this i have gone around the country talking to tax administrators and said that yes you have a target to collect revenue but please don t overreach we have been assuring taxpayers all that is on one level but the prime minister himself has wondered if we really respect the taxpayer hence we thought if we are clear about the intention why should we not put into law if my research is right there are only three countries that have it in their law itself australia usa and canada i am glad we have joined that league to assure taxpayers that this government s intention is to trust wealth creators and taxpayers you took a leeway of 0 5 percentage point to raise the fiscal deficit target from 3 3 to 3 8 and you say you will moving forward return to a path of fiscal discipline what does the budget say to domestic and international investors you are referring to the frbm act and since circumstances now needs us to increase spending this has been a deliberate decision we have also had issues with revenue generation since gst collections had not been up to the target for a few months this year given both of these circumstances we have utilised the forbearance clause otherwise we would not have been reflecting the truth if you look at all the numbers there is a level of pragmatism some of the tax receipts you are estimating this year are lower than last year you think they are achievable yes corporate tax cut will have show after a time lag but i have to bear the brunt in showing that i lost the money today if i am able to come back to some discipline in fiscal deficit by saying 3 5 in the budget estimate it is because i expect revenue generation to improve the nominal growth expectation of 10 is the lowest in a long time it is realistic i think because we don t want to give an impression in fact in the house when i said this some members misunderstood so i had to repeat that it is nominal gdp growth how will you define this budget as a matter of a central theme on social media the ministry ran a hashtag janjankabudget that was the objective to touch every section and also to send the larger message that this is a responsible government it knows its limitations and its responsibilities it is also a government that knows that only half of india s potential is being utilised we will do whatever it takes to encourage the utilisation of the country s full potential one very big strand of your budget has been this emphasis on market forces to give you an example normally where fms would have used the fiscal space to spend more you have chosen the option of cutting taxes and giving power to individuals and companies on how they spend is this a seminal shift in the ideological approach to budget making it is a shift to suit and in line with our ideology the government has to do only as much as is expected from a government the pm made this clear when he said government should have an impact but not make you feel indebted the government s role cannot be overwhelming if i have to constantly spend collect it is never going to end you will never be able to work out a mechanism through which the economy can drive itself at a pace at which it can move not generate too much heat and at the same time be sustainable in the way in which it moves forward most of the things where we are putting our equity we are also saying it should be in public private partnership ppp mode we are also saying that states will also have to be in it this whole idea of only the central or state government will spend no longer works it has to be all three together where i have land i give you land where i have power generation capabilities i give that but where others will have to come in they will similarly in railways some of the prime routes are suffering because net collection has not been improved nor is cross subsidy any longer justifiable you can t leave the poor paying high rates some of these routes will be given out in ppp model bengaluru suburban is using railway tracks around the city the decision between the state and us is that it should be on metro pricing model it can t be railway subsidising tickets and the state government running it that is just not sustainable in everything that we have announced the directional change in which that project will have to run for itself is made clear eventually it will have to be sustainable on its own is the plan even in infrastructure this sovereign wealth fund instead of the classic model of the government going out and investing money you have created the space for them to come in and made it very attractive for them we have given them enough incentive we have made sure that the money they earn over interest and other things will not be taxed provided they spend on infrastructure provided they lock in for a certain number of years it is not like it s just been given every single word uttered in the budget has gone through different layers and all of us will own it up the time that the pm has given to see that they are falling in place is amazing the other thing that we have noticed in the last five years is that the public sector is no longer what your political opponents call family silver in this budget you have taken it to a different level you are trebling your disinvestment receipts are we seeing another big shift yes if you have noticed i have said that money from disinvestment will go to the companies which are going to be investing in long term infrastructure sale of family silver is not going for revenue expenses it is going towards greater asset creation responsible disinvestment responsible sale if at all of family silver that is again being put towards asset creation that asset which you no longer can run efficiently and make profit is clearly offloaded but here we put the receipts into the infrastructure pipeline the two companies which i ve mentioned will receive the funds they will take the money it is a responsible way in which public expenditure is being handled so you are saying it won t be used to balance the fiscal deficit or to finance it no i have very clearly told you that this is how it is going is that a general off the cuff remark no we have already given 22 000 crore towards pipeline projects to these two companies which means we are putting the money where our mouth is but is this number achievable absolutely i think because to be fair the last announcement was made in july again to be fair the officials have done tremendous footwork to get it all off the table lic will be the key i guess to meet the disinvestment target the leg work was done between july and now because all this has its own timelines i am not benefiting by the same this financial year but it s going to the next fiscal but ruthlessly to think you did not do it within a financial year and will you be able to do it next time is not right because this time we have done the footwork and it s going to be ready immediately after the commencement of the next year and what is the idea behind getting lic to do an ipo to get more money to be invested by retail investors more money to come in from others why should it be only the government investing more public more opening up the crowding out does not happen crowding in should come in now you are projecting an increase in your income tax collections despite the cut that you are pushing through right now so do you think it is achievable i am keeping both the systems going right or you are expecting some buoyancy of course because income tax i don t think is suffering now the direct tax collection is going on fine the gst got affected and it is now restored in fact there is a significant increase in gst even in these things you are expecting a recalibration of rates you are counting on that yes that will also be a part but there is a lot of removing the deadwood the evasion which is happening is being plucked otherwise technically as per media assessment nothing has changed in the overall going back to your statement of involving states as a stakeholder are we also seeing this budget signal the limits of a union government shouldering the economic burden as it were and is now looking to involve states no no i wouldn t see it like that why should we involve the states more because most of the activity happens there the land is with them zones are with them if we want every district to be an export hub the activities start from them the economic survey has one very interesting data if you noticed the chief economic advisor has based it on hard data and he has taken on board nearly 480 odd districts in doing that data because of private entrepreneurship the growth is unbelievable at the district level so why would it not have an optimism about revenue generation the stock market seems to have reacted adversely to the budget as an fm does it concern you it is not a fully open stock market today saturday not all wings of the stock market have been operational today we will have to wait for monday so it doesn t worry you as an fm i am confident that the stock market will get the full picture of the budget by monday
a top u n official has warned that the international community would pay a terrible price if it fails to help rebuild sudan s dilapidated economy as the african country transitions to civilian rule the story of sudan in year 2020 is not the story of the previous government united nations development programme undp administrator achim steiner told afp in an interview during his visit to sudan this week it is the story in which waiting for too long to actually step in and support this development process may have a terrible price more than a year after the start of a nationwide protest movement that led to the ouster of longtime ruler omar al bashir last april sudan faces a series of challenges driven by an economic crisis years of recession were a key trigger for the protest movement against bashir s 30 year old autocratic regime months after he was ousted the economy remains burdened with foreign debt of more than 60 billion inflation of about 60 percent soaring unemployment and chronic shortage of fuel and foreign currency but these challenges are exactly the opportunity for the international community to step in and help sudan said steiner the first undp chief to ever visit the northeast african country here is a country in which the youth and particularly the women have not only managed to pull off a peaceful revolution in large part but they actually have an agenda to build a developmental state steiner said the international community must recognize how unusual and how extraordinarily helpful this is in a region that is otherwise providing more and more worrying news about political instability and about extremism danger in forgetting sudan sudanese officials say there has been a lackluster response from the international community to the country s reform process led by new prime minister abdalla hamdok a well respected economist most blame washington s continued blacklisting of sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism which makes international banking cumbersome and keeps overseas investors away in october 2017 washington lifted its 20 year old trade embargo imposed on sudan but kept the country on the terrorism blacklist along with iran syria and north korea removing sudan from the blacklist is likely to take time with washington seeking assurances that bashir s regime is being fully dismantled steiner said that for many sudan s blacklisting was no longer a crucial issue and he urged the u s congress to expedite the delisting he said the international community was taking sudan a little bit for granted we are in danger of forgetting that sudan is actually a story that is more hopeful than it has been for 30 years and are we missing an opportunity to actually lean in and support it said steiner we as undp are certainly committed to increasing our engagement this is a win win proposition wiser plans needed global financial institutions demand that sudan launch widespread reforms to revive its economy including cutting subsidies which according to steiner should be done gradually our role and that of the world bank the imf is to come up with wiser and smarter advice than simply saying to sudan well you are failing in your reform if you don t do x or y he said steiner lauded the new authorities for engaging in talks with rebel groups for ending conflicts in darfur blue nile and south kordofan regions riven by fighting under bashir over the years hundreds of thousands have been killed and millions displaced in fighting between bashir s forces and rebels in these regions steiner said it was up to the sudanese people to decide what kind of society they now wanted but they needed the help of the international community to build that society when you are on your knees when a previous government has raided the coffers of a nation for decades you have to look to the international community to also be part of that recovery effort and i think this is the story that is unfolding before our eyes in sudan today he said more on the subject

overall organic volumes were flat in the quarter as we improve sequentially following our key objective of driving positive growth in our businesses i m pleased to report that our north american

our debt saving the company 45 million in annual cash interest costs now looking at some details specifically by segment our consumer packaging north american business recorded stronger than expected organic volume growth in the quarter of 3 as we continue on to focus on investing in growing markets where we have advantaged products and we are encouraged by the momentum of the division delivering now seven consecutive quarters of positive organic volume growth our health hygiene specialties division reported flat organic volumes excluding the customer product transition we spoke of previously and saw sequential quarter over quarter volume improvement we continue to innovate deploy new capital for organic growth and focus on increasing our share of wallet with existing customers while pivoting our business to faster growing markets such as adult incontinence feminine care and medical our investments made in china and north america are on track and started benefiting us here in early 2020 inside our engineered materials division we also saw sequential quarter over quarter volume improvement as projected and we made progress on boarding our new business pipeline discussed in previous calls additionally we have started to deploy capital as part of our commitment of investing 150 million over the next three years toward growth in next generation products and lastly our consumer packaging international business reported another quarter of solid results this segment primarily consists of business from our recent acquisition of rpc group which closed in july 9th 2019 it s now been two quarters since we acquired rpc and we re even more excited about the long term benefits and strategic rationale of this combination our team continues to work diligently to identify opportunities and share best practices this acquisition has transformed berry creating a leading global company with an unmatched diversified global product offering and delivery capability creating significant value for our customers additionally through our combined collaboration know how material science product development and manufacturing technologies we truly are an innovative thought leader when it comes to designing for sustainability we continue to integrate the business with an intense focus on realizing the cost synergies in our initial forecast of 150 million and finally before i turn the call over to mark who will review our financial results in more detail i want to reiterate our focus on driving profitable and sustainable organic growth and our expectation of

committing billions of dollars in capacity additions with the benefit of low cost raw materials in the united states now mark will provide more details and remarks and then i ll come back to discuss our strategy and then open the call for questions mark mark w miles chief financial officer thank you tom i would like to refer everyone to slide 6 now as tom referenced first quarter reported sales were up 43 to just over 2 8 billion the increase included revenue from the acquisition of rpc and continued positive organic volumes in our north american consumer packaging business these positives were partially offset by lower selling prices due to the pass through of lower resin costs and the sale of our seal for life business from an earnings perspective the december quarter operating ebitda increased by 36 to 451 million the increase included contributions in the rpc acquisition synergy realization and organic earnings growth at our north american consumer packaging segment these improvements were partially offset by the sale of our seal for life business and anticipated unfavorable price cost spread and our engineered materials and health hygiene specialty segments now looking at the results of each operating segment starting on slide 7 the prior year results have been restated to match the current structure for the quarter our consumer packaging international division delivered sales of over 1 billion and operating ebitda of 142 million this division primarily consists of business acquired as part of the rpc transaction and therefore we re not included in our historical results so for comparison purposes we are utilizing results prior to our ownership legacy rpc operating ebitda and volumes declined low single digits compared to the prior year quarter specifically our pharmaceutical and waste management businesses produced solid volume growth in the quarter along with flat volumes in our food business offset by general softness in european markets as a reminder 70 of the portfolio is consumer non discretionary products such as food beverage healthcare and personal care and the remaining 30 is tied in the end markets like building and construction automotive distribution and other specialty categories we now have two quarters of results under our belt and remain very confident of the long term value creation opportunities from the combination through the first two quarters we are encouraged by the prospects of the business and proud of the execution of the team with the legacy rpc business generating low single digit operating ebitda growth on a constant currency basis on slightly lower base volumes next on slide 8 sales in our consumer packaging north america division were 680 million in the quarter which was 13 higher than the december 2018 quarter as a result of the addition of the north american rigid business from the rpc acquisition along with better than expected organic volume growth of 3 as the business has continued executing its long term strategy focusing on advantaged products in targeted markets these contributions were partially offset by lower selling prices and the contractual pass through of lower resin cost to our customers operating ebitda for the division in the quarter was 121 million compared to 88 million in the prior year quarter this 38 increase was primarily driven by the contributions in the rpc acquisition including synergies from the combination and continued organic volume growth turning to slide 9 our health hygiene specialties division delivered sales of 541 million in the quarter compared to 659 million in the prior year quarter the decrease was primarily attributed to the contractual pass through of lower resin prices to our customers the sale of our seal for life business and the customer product transition in hygiene we referenced on prior earnings calls excluding the customer product transition organic sales volume was flat for the quarter and on track relative to our commitment to generate positive organic volume growth as we continue to secure incremental demand and pivot our product portfolio to faster growing end markets operating ebitda decreased by 18 million from the prior year quarter when adjusted for the sale of the seal for life business this decrease was consistent with our expectation as highlighted on our lastearnings callas a result of unfavorable price cost spread and the lost earnings from the customer product transition this will be the last quarter the customer product transition will have a significant impact on us on our year over year comparison next on slide 10 sales for our engineered materials division was 585 million for the quarter compared to 661 million and the prior year quarter the decrease was primarily attributed to the pass through of lower resin prices and lower organic volumes which were consistent with our expectation as we sequentially improved volumes and continue the qualification process of recent business wins our effort and focus to regain market share with regional and local customers is positively impacting our results operating ebitda in our engineered materials division was 106 million compared to 126 million in the prior year quarter primarily as a result of unfavorable price cost spread is expected we are encouraged by the progress our team has made and the positive momentum of the business this momentum can be seen with operating ebitda in the december quarter coming in higher and the seasonally stronger september quarter slide 11 provides a summary of our income statement for our first fiscal quarter overall operating income was 199 million in the quarter compared to 176 million in the prior year quarter primarily attributed to the improved operating ebitda just discussed partially offset by incremental depreciation and amortization from the rpc acquisition our net income for the quarter was 47 million and our adjusted earnings per share was 0 56 noting that we do not add back amortization of intangibles from acquisitions if we were to add back this amortization it would result in an annual adjusted eps improvement of over 30 and should be considered when comparing to other companies that adjust for amortization of intangibles from acquisitions next on slide 12 the company generated 218 million of cash flow from operations in the quarter compared to 161 million in the december 2018 quarter increasing over 35 primarily from incremental cash flow resulting from the rpc acquisition net capital expenditures in the quarter were 148 million as we incurred spending on cost reduction initiatives as well as customer linked growth related projects and in line with our 600 million plan for fiscal 2020 our free cash flow for the december 2019 quarter was in line with the prior year quarter of 70 million for the four quarters ended free cash flow totaled 764 million with our substantial free cash flow and our commitment to strengthen our balance sheet we completed a partial redemption of 100 million on our 6 notes during the quarter and also issued a redemption notice on another 100 million that closed just last week we are pleased to report that we completed our first issuance into the european bond market opening a new market for berry we issued two first lien notes a eur700 million five year bond at a 1 fixed rate and a eur375 million seven year bond at a fixed rate of 1 5 with the proceeds used to repay our eur1 1 billion term loan also during the quarter we refinanced 4 25 billion of our us term loans reducing the interest rate spread by 50 basis points annual cash interest savings from these recent refinancings and debt repayment is 45 million we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our consistently increasing dependable and improving free cash flow provides us the opportunity to further improve our strong balance sheet as we have demonstrated historically our fiscal year 2020 free cash flow guidance and assumptions are shown on slide 13 today we are reaffirming our fiscal 2020 free cash flow of 800 million which includes 1 4 billion of cash flow from operations partially offset by capital expenditures of 600 million this guidance includes the use of cash for working capital and other restructuring related costs related to the rpc acquisition of 90 million along with cash taxes of 160 million and cash interest of 500 million based on current interest rates we will have a tailwind on cash interest given the completed refinancings and debt reduction just referenced additionally as softness in european markets persist we would anticipate a headwind to our fiscal year earnings forecast the volume trajectory of our legacy businesses remain on track as we anticipate positive organic base volume growth in our march 2020 quarter we are proud of our history of exceeding our free cash guidance each and every year looking beyond 2020 including realization of synergies and excluding the associated integration costs our normalized free cash flow would be more than 900 million which represents a free cash flow yield of nearly 15 using our quarter end market capitalization this concludes my financial review and now i will turn it back to tom thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer thanks mark now across the company as we look forward our teams continue to be focused on integrating rpc acquisition optimize our cost structure and fully realizing acquisition synergies along with managing the investments in growth initiatives in each of our divisions going forward we will continue to focus on locating and identifying organic growth opportunities with targeted investments in select markets with advanced innovative solutions to provide high quality products and service to our customers next the transformative acquisition of rpc gives us a world class product innovation engine where we enjoy leading positions in higher value added closures dispensing systems medical devices and healthcare packaging we have and will continue to commit resources to create profitable and sustainable organic growth across these markets similarly rpc s presence in emerging markets complements various growth objectives in multiple industry segments the strategic merit long term benefit financial impact of this combination represents an incredible opportunity for all stakeholders being able to leverage our combined know how material science supply chain product development manufacturing technology and sustainable solutions gives us certainty that the combination will benefit berry in the years ahead despite the percent i m sorry we remain confident in our total cost synergy target of 150 million with half or 75 million expected to be realized in fiscal year 2020 and again with the rpc acquisition we can generally say we re even more exciting now than ever about the growth potential of its combination the best practice sharing and global servicing capabilities it will provide coupled with an unmatched unique set of global product solution offerings for our customers creating an extraordinary opportunity for all stakeholders which will generate much value we continue to work diligently across all our businesses to grow organically and have been able to demonstrate organic volume growth by providing advantaged products in targeted markets as evidenced in our consumer packaging north american segment which has grown positive on for the past seven quarters our organic growth projects in both engineered materials and health hygiene specialties divisions remain on track and we remain confident in our projections of volume inflection for these divisions in fiscal 2020 our record level of expected capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 of 600 million is further evidence to our commitment and focus on organic growth while maintaining our low cost position in the markets we serve to drive further value for berry additionally i want to highlight again the continued strength we are seeing in our consumer packaging business despite the perception of possible headwinds regarding plastics we continue to grow our share versus alternate substrates evidenced by nearly two years of averaging 3 organic volume growth inside our north america consumer packaging business through plastics advantages of offering lighter weight clarity design versatility durability protection and cost and for these same benefit that is taking considerable share over the past 50 years we now see additional opportunities that we designed for sustainability and provide optionality for our customers to reduce plastics waste to be clear we are doing everything possible to increase the demand of recycled materials such as lightweighting reformulation tagging and identification and chemical recycling all in an effort to create a more circular economy as the market navigates and choose the best options to improve recycling rates and reduce plastics waste berry along with rpc already proven expertise puts us in a leadership and scale position to assist our customers meeting their sustainability goals and initiatives lastly i would like to highlight that we remain committed to maintain a strong balance sheet and we are well positioned to continue our historical track record of growing our free cash flow we feel very confident in our ability to meet our 800 million free cash flow target in fiscal year 2020 just as we ve done every single year as a publicly traded company and we re equally confident in our expectations of volume trajectory in fiscal 2020 and finally berry will continue to take the steps necessary to remain a leader in the markets where we participate through a relentless focus on building and strengthening our competitive advantages to ultimately maximize shareholder value the management of berry continues to be focused on finding ways to extract more value for our stakeholders by reinvesting in our leading low cost position leveraging our resources around the businesses with the greatest opportunity to grow and create value for our customers all while doing our part to protect our environment i am confident that the people at berry will continue to drive positive results and achieve our goals and mission of always advancing to protect what s important thank you for your continued interest in berry and at this time mark and i will be glad to answer any questions you may have questions and answers operator ladies and gentlemen at this time we would like to open up the question and answer session our first question comes from the line of neel kumar from morgan stanley your line is open neel kumar morgan stanley analyst hi good morning thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer hi neel neel kumar morgan stanley analyst you talked about some earnings risk from the weaker european economic environment can you just give us a sense of how you would quantify the downside and how are trends looking so far in your march quarter for the industrial piece of the business for rpc thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer well like we said we re it s early in the quarter right now but clearly while we re pleased with the progress we made inside of rpc relative to synergy realization we did see softness in our industrial space and generally just european market landscape as a whole both eastern and western europe that was offset somewhat by strength in our pharma business waste management and the food business was relatively flat so again we are assuming going forward flat volumes for the legacy rpc business and at this time you know we re watching it closely to see just how transitory this is at this stage neel kumar morgan stanley analyst okay thanks and then just for my follow up could you just give some more color on the price cost headwinds in em and hh s i know that some of it s been driven by the cost of onboarding new business and the negative operating leverage but you also expect that to inflect positive in 2q for em and 3q for hh s along with volumes and then are you what are you embedding in terms of price cost in your full year guidance thanks mark w miles chief financial officer yes sure for both businesses we expect that relationship to continue to be negative in the march quarter and expect inflection to occur within the june quarter for both hh s and em for the same reasons as we continue to see the volumes inflect on some of the start up costs associated with the new assets wind down in the upcoming quarters both i would say inflection within the june quarter and that is both of those assumptions are embedded within our guidance thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer operator next question operator yes sir our next question comes from the line of george staphos from bofa your line is open george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi everyone good morning thanks for all the details guys it s early in the year and i wouldn t have expected you to adjust your guidance either way frankly unless something significant had changed but nonetheless one of the obvious questions i think neel was touching on a little bit is you know the risk that europe presents or maybe it doesn t to your free cash flow guidance so is there is the takeaway yes you ve gotten whatever after tax perhaps about a 30 million benefit from the refinancing and maybe it s a little bit less than that because it would happen partially through the year because of the european risk is that basically one offsetting the other in terms of why you didn t adjust guidance now or is there something else that s at play here perhaps it s just it s too early in the year to adjust guidance and again if you re in our seat part two of my question here and we re trying to determine what combination of macro or other fundamental trends that we could track from the outside market that would occur that would make reaching your guidance a little bit more difficult than currently is the case thank you mark w miles chief financial officer yes i think george relative to the interest comment it s a combination of the refinancings debt repayment as well as softer interest rates and the order of magnitude of all of that would be out of the tailwind of 50 million that s pre tax on fiscal 2020 relative to our original guidance to your point it s still early in the year but based on current conditions if interest rates were to remain the same and things were to play out as expected we would have a tailwind of about 50 million pre tax on interest costs relative to european economies in our guidance as you pointed out appropriately it s early in the year we have a flat assumption as you may recall embedded in our guidance it started off a little weaker than that in europe we had offsets in our north america consumer packaging business as well as hh s that got off to a little stronger start relative to volumes that helped to offset that weakness in q1 as you pointed out it s just early in the year we have a short cycle business to the extent european economies stayed the same as they did in q1 it would be a pretty similar offset to the interest savings that we have but as you said still early we ll continue to update the market on a quarterly basis thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer and george i would say any macro factors in europe we believe ultimately will be transitory the business will be a low single digit grower long term we have no doubts about that whatsoever we continue invest in aspects of that business specifically around dispensing solutions and closures because that s with the combination of rpc in europe and legacy berry we have a global leading portfolio around those product lines serving areas like healthcare pharmaceutical as you heard from our results both those business lines with food being flat and waste management was favorable as well so a little early in the year but you know we re just articulating what we re seeing from a macro perspective but by no means do we think that has any negative impact relative to our expectation that this will be a low single digit grower longer term george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst right but you know if the exit rate continues the rest of year basically the best you could model now and we won t hold you to this because there s so many vagaries in the model and the forecast anyway it would offset the interest but hopefully it shouldn t continue for the whole year is that a fair summary mark w miles chief financial officer yes that s fair thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer yes that s fair george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thank you all right guys thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of anthony pettinari from citi your line is open anthony pettinari citigroup analyst good morning tom i think you both your legacy business and our rpc have facilities in china and i was wondering if you could just remind us what your total presence in china is now from a sales perspective and then just what impact you re seeing or you might anticipate seeing from the coronavirus thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer thanks anthony we ve got 15 facilities within what i would describe as the affected areas of china and thailand those regions represent about 5 of our overall sales i m frankly very proud of our berry team in china we are actually prioritizing the manufacture of materials non wovens specifically for the healthcare market we have been working with local authorities to maximize 24 7 the production of surgical grade face mask materials n95 respirators as well as surgical gowns and drapes for the protection of airborne and blood borne pathogens in the region our plans continue to operate we continue to work closely with the relevant health authorities with the priority of making certain our people are safe but similarly consistent with our mission of always advancing to protect what s important we re providing products on the non wovens side to support what is a growing crisis around the world with protected solutions specific to face masks gowns and in the united states the protection of disinfectant wipes for surgical suites and other regions so the business is very active relative to that and we are prioritizing the healthcare and medical portfolio across all of our sites specifically in our nanhai facility in china anthony pettinari citigroup analyst okay that s great to hear and i guess just sticking with hh s you indicated organic volumes were ahead of your expectations in the quarter it seemed like some of the big customers in the space maybe had a tough quarter from a volume standpoint just wondering what you re doing that kind of allowed you to outperform your own expectations in the quarter on hh s thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer we have i m very proud of this team and as we ve talked about for several quarters the level of agility that this business showed when frankly we made a growing focused effort to increase our share of wallet with existing customers we made targeted investments in faster growing regions of the world we pivoted our portfolio to areas such as adult incontinence feminine care biopharma and specialty applications and it s paying dividends i will reiterate i m very confident we will hit the volume inflection as we ve committed anthony pettinari citigroup analyst okay that s helpful i ll turn it over operator our next question comes from the line of ghansham panjabi from baird your line is open ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst hey guys good morning thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer good morning mark w miles chief financial officer good morning ghansham ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst hey tom just picking up on that last comment on the march quarter volume inflection year over year and just to clarify is that comment specific to legacy berry so cp north america engineered materials and hh s or does that include rpc as well and if so does that assume the rpc volumes will be flat just trying to get a better sense of that thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer yes relative to the organic volume tied to legacy berry that would be the organic definition and we re assuming it s going forward i m sorry ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst okay and then thanks for clarifying and then for the em segment you know does have some level of macroeconomic exposure i think with industrial end markets etc can you just give us a sense as to how big that industrial end market composite would be for that segment how do they perform in the december quarter and what are you embedding for that specific end market for the march quarter thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer yes on previous calls we ve talked about our efforts to ultimately regain our share at small and mid sized customers i m very pleased with our progress toward that objective and ultimately it s driving the confidence that we have in the volume inflection you know i will state that the month of december for engineered materials business was positive on a year over year basis which is a positive inflection for us relative to our q2 pivot to positive growth we are represented by small now mid sized as well as national distributors it was a key objective for us to regain that share and similarly we re also as mark had talked about some of the price cost headwind part of that s also driven by additional resources that we brought into the business from a technical perspective to not only onboard the new demand pipeline that we talked of in the past but also relative to the support of our capital investments which are about a 150 million that we ll invest over the next three years to support not only next generation products but also invest in our conversion cost to make certain that it that we maintain our low cost leadership position i m also pleased that from a commercial perspective the team has done an excellent job not only working with our operations to onboard the pipeline but also continue to build that pipeline and i feel pretty confident that the size of the pipeline that we ll enjoy in 2020 will be consistent with what we saw in 2019 as well so the commitment that we re making toward organic growth it s real it s for all of our businesses again with the objective to have all our business to deliver in low single digit growth mark w miles chief financial officer this is mark ghansham the only thing i would add is so engineered materials is almost exclusively a north american business our health hygiene specialties is global business where we did see some softness again in europe they were able to overcome that in the other regions and achieve flat volume even with that weakness so thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer yes i think that s a great point as mark said the weakness we saw was not tied specifically to rpc we saw it similarly in our european base business tied to hhs but we were fortunate to offset it with strength in the cp north america and north american hhs business in the quarter ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst and just to clarify that 70 30 for rpc that you sort of outlined what s that 70 due from a volume standpoint in the december quarter and what about that other 30 thanks again mark w miles chief financial officer yes i don t have that breakdown in front of me ghansham i think the weakness that was more pronounced in the 30 than the 70 but i don t have it broken down in that manner but it was a larger negative in the 30 more industrial type applications on the legacy rpc business thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer yes more industrial applications automotive some softness as well as you ve heard in other calls relative to the personal care business ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst got it thanks again guys operator our next question comes from the line of tyler langton from jpmorgan your line is open tyler langton jpmorgan analyst good morning tom and mark thanks i guess now that you ve had time to dig into rpc a bit more i mean are there any i guess assets that you d kind of consider selling and then also just have you rationalized any products i know there s not a whole lot overlap with your sort of consumer north america but has there been any sort of rationalization that s you know sort of weighed on volumes thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer not not significant rationalization from an rpc perspective but i would know any time we do an acquisition and with a portfolio of the size of berry s as well prior to the acquisition of rpc we re constantly looking at the portfolio and determining if there s areas that ultimately are going to be prioritized relative to our growth objectives relative to paring or shedding businesses that s an active process that we undertake and at a point in time that we have anything to share that is actionable we ll be certain to share on our future call tyler langton jpmorgan analyst great and then just with consumer north america the volumes up 3 i guess could you just give a little bit more detail sort of what s driving that growth and then i guess compared to last quarter i guess do you think that higher rate is sustainable and just kind of what you think about that for the back half of the year thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer yes that s good question again listen cp is a business that again we i think we talked about it in on the previous calls we ve been investing in that business relative to organic growth now to support our objective to deliver low single digit growth i would say cp is going to be a low single digit growth producer clearly we were pleased with 3 in a quarter but we saw from a range of product lines inside that category containers bottles pharmaceutical healthcare our vials business we re all strong in the quarter and we re really pleased with the pace of progress from those teams and the pipeline that s ultimately they re executing against that will benefit us not only here in 2020 but certainly 21 and beyond this is a strategic commitment and objective for our company to deliver the growth and we re applying the right resources toward the right target investments to make it happen and the fact that we saw growth across such a diverse number of segments gives us a great deal of confidence and what we re doing in cp north america is the same thing that we re doing in deploying in the acquisition of rpc making certain that we re prioritizing our investments where we can further stimulate growth where we can expedite and speed the pace of growth in businesses that we believe we have a sustainable differentiated advantage the same model that we re applying across all the businesses tyler langton jpmorgan analyst great thanks so much operator our next question comes from the line of brian maguire from goldman sachs your line is open brian maguire goldman sachs analyst hey good morning just wanted to come back to some of the differences in volumes between north america and international consumer and i guess europe in general and i know tom you said that you re not seeing any real impact from the sustainability conversation but i guess the question is really why do you think so much of the weakness that you re seeing in volumes is taking place in europe right now i know there are economies may be a little bit slower than in the us but seems like the consumers may be holding up all right just wondered if you could talk about if you are seeing like more pronounced de stocking there or things like brexit have any impact and then just sort of related it that if 30 of that consumer international business is sort of more industrial facing maybe why not put that in the em segment or break it out a little bit separately because it does seem like a lot of the volume weakness you re calling out are more industrial and cyclical markets than truly the more stable consumer markets we re used to seeing thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer so i would say that volume you know how we ultimately pivot products in given segments it s something that we look at on a regular basis actually we did some of that when we first bought rpc by moving some of the north american businesses from international to our north american side of cp as you said that 30 tied into things like automotive and if you look at the major economies in europe relative to automotive demand think about germany think about the uk think about spain you ve got economic softness in those regions i believe that it s transitory and we continue to believe though this business will be a low single digit grower and it s really about there were pockets of de stocking or softness tied the personal care and you ve heard others mentioned that we saw some of that as well but by no means is this a component that we re losing share to other substrates i reiterate this is not about us losing share to other substrate this is about transitory macro softness specific to our industrial based businesses brian maguire goldman sachs analyst okay and then just a separate question on capital reallocation priorities this call and others you guys have highlighted the free cash flow yield i think you think that s an attractive valuation metric yes and the priority has clearly been to repair the balance sheet and delever but with the stock under pressure again any thoughts on maybe delaying the deleveraging process and restarting the buyback authorization is that something that s on the table thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer our priorities are clear what we say we re going to delever the company get our leverage back below 4 times and ultimately deliver on our commitments relative to growth along with the predictable free cash flow which is over 900 million on a normalized basis and i think things will take care of themselves this business now with the ability for us to deliver value on a global basis and with the diversity of our portfolio with the strength of the sustainability capability we have both from a design as well as the use of post consumer chemically recycled mechanically recycled materials and our ability to ultimately interface with our end users to the degree we are to support waste reduction in a circular economy is frankly a very strong value proposition we announced yesterday a partnership with georgia pacific further reiterating our ability to support the circular economy where we ll ultimately take recycled materials from georgia pacific we ll ultimately reintroduce those into new products again demonstrating our ability to deliver on that commitment to reduce plastics waste to take advantage of available raw material and resource and we have the ability to partner with key end users and partners like a georgia pacific with all the end users that we serve throughout the market we re doing this as an example and what was announced yesterday we re doing this in the e commerce space and there s a lot more to come this is an incredibly dynamic time and we re thrilled to be part of the narrative brian maguire goldman sachs analyst okay thanks very much operator our next question comes from the line of arun viswanathan from rbc capital markets your line is open thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer next question operator our next question comes from the line of mike leithead from barclays your line is open mike leithead barclays analyst thanks good morning guys thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer good morning mike leithead barclays analyst i guess first on the resin side we ve been hearing from the resin producers about greater discounting in the us market just given the new supply there i know you re already quite a big buyer in that market but i was curious if you re seeing any incremental impact from greater resin discounting in the market today thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer listen the majority resin for us is ostensibly a pass through clearly what i would what i think is most pertinent is that we see continued stability in the commodities market unlike that we ve seen in the in the prior years and that stability ultimately is a plus as you re all aware there s been significant investment made in north america relative to polyolefins and clearly it supports frankly from a cost perspective the value of this material versus other substrates so i think it s more of that we re seeing not only in resin but frankly other raw materials as well as freight greater stability this year than we saw last year for sure mike leithead barclays analyst got it that s helpful and then i was hoping you could provide a like on like volume number for the consumer international business for the quarter but i think that was the one saying when i didn t see a volume number for in the release mark w miles chief financial officer sure it was down approximately 3 year over year mike leithead barclays analyst got it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of anojja shah from bmo capital markets your line is open anojja shah bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning i wanted to go back to this georgia pacific announcement you made yesterday on recycling plastics is this similar to what rpc is already doing in europe and can recycling plastic waste eventually be a profit center for berry thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer we re not doing this just as a public service we believe any opportunity to monetize these opportunities to recycle materials to eliminate plastics waste given berry scale number of facilities and ability to reclaim and reprocess as unique value proposition so yes we ll look to continue to replicate this the differences and it s similar what we do in rpc not exactly the same but the project with georgia pacific is just very unique that you re taking an experience company in the recycling industry the opportunity to collaborate and partner with them to remove these materials from the landfill reincorporate them in new products is an exceptional opportunity and we clearly believe that from a scale perspective that is a competitive advantage for us because we have the end use relationships the number of manufacturing and converting sites to ultimately execute in and against it your comment relative to rpc again though in terms of what they re doing from recycling we re learning a ton from them they clearly when we bought them we re further ahead from a sustainability perspective and the opportunities to steal the best practices from them and explore other opportunities that we can participate in the circular economy whether it s chemical recycling mechanical recycling it s something we re really encouraged by and frankly rpc has helped enable that for us anojja shah bmo capital markets analyst great thank you and then for my follow up question sorry if i missed that but just can you talk about foodservice volumes in consumer packaging in the quarter and also what you re seeing in foodservice relative for the battle between plastics fiber and other alternatives thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer foodservice continues to be a strong performer it similarly supported the positive growth in the quarter and i would only argue that the success of that business over the last two years has been driven by substrate conversion in our favor anojja shah bmo capital markets analyst okay great thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of kyle white from deutsche bank your line is open kyle white deutsche bank analyst hey good morning everyone thanks for taking my question just following up on the georgia pacific announcement and the talk on post consumer resin curious how much post consumer resin you currently use and where you think that could go in the next few years and then on top of that are you finding that customers i think we can all agree that the brands are wanting to become more sustainable but are you finding that customers are actually willing to pay up to use this kind of material versus virgin thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer our percentage of used in terms of post consumer material is relative to our overall spend it was up on a year over year basis but it s still a relatively smaller percentage of our overall spend from a raw material perspective i will tell you that discussion and conversation with end users is better more collaborative more balanced than it s ever been the both i think converters like ourselves as well as end users are balancing not only supply but ultimately determining what the best sustainable designs will be for them going forward and i think this is going to continue to materialize throughout the course of the year but it is it s very encouraging the level of dialogue and the percentage of time that we re spending collaborating with our end users on how we can meet their sustainability objectives reducing plastics waste reducing waste to landfill and supporting our objective and certainly our commitment to end plastics waste of eliminating plastic waste and it s been very positive i ve been doing this a lot of years and the dialogue is more actionable and better than ever before we at berry believe that our ability to educate around designing for sustainability and the alternatives that are available to our end customers are real clearly right now there is a disparity between virgin cost and recycled cost but over time as demand continues to increase that will level set and frankly some are challenging themselves to take on the responsibility and pass that cost forward so we ll see it s going to continue evolve over time but i will tell you it s not just it s just not commitments on paper the discussions are active and they re actionable and i expect to see that number in terms of post consumer usage and demand increase as well as the objectives to overall weight reduce which berry is similarly an industry leader and our ability to reduce and take weight out of our plastic parts kyle white deutsche bank analyst got it that s helpful and then just a quick one if i look at the normalized free cash flow the 900 million can you just help me bridge the 800 million this year that you re guiding to the normalized 900 million i guess if i layer on the additional 75 million of synergies kind of tax effect us and then take out the working capital and other headwinds that you had this year i get to a little bit higher number but i understand this pricing level conservatism mark w miles chief financial officer no that s the exact math yeah just taking the 800 million adding back the unrealized synergy as well as eliminating the integration costs associated with rpc and tax affecting those kyle white deutsche bank analyst all right thank you good luck in the year mark w miles chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of salvator tiano from vertical your line is open salvator tiano vertical analyst yeah hi tom mark and dustin firstly a little bit of a big picture question you kind of addressed it talking about convergence in foodservice to plastics but just a big picture when we go back a few years ago there are many many years in a row with the negative volumes and now you re on a very sustainable path two years roughly positive growth can you tell us a little bit what you ve done on your end to change the business the segment and what has changed with regard to the end markets not just foodservice and i guess plastic cups but broadly that has led to this growth trajectory thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer yeah happy too i think strategically you have to go back and realize that often times historically when we would do acquisitions we would call volume or walk away from volume because it may not have met our margin expectations the business for consumer packaging north america hasn t been impacted by an acquisition for the last seven five or seven years or so so it s really been operating on its own and our focus was identifying which opportunity we could create differentiation and then invest behind the differentiation and as a result it has paid dividends for us not only in foodservice but in our specialty bottles business and our farm and healthcare business and we re making similar investments to support our already leading position and closures and vials and we ll continue to do that and i think it s a all investments are not considered equal and we really are making tough decisions to make certain that the investments we make are absolutely on the right opportunities no different than what we ve done inside of hhs to support growth in a faster growing region like china with our high loss soft material and in our five investments which remains on track and will be sold out by the end of 2020 salvator tiano vertical analyst great and just as a follow up i wanted to see a little bit the impact of light weighting in engineered materials and health hygiene and specialties i think historically given how you count volumes on a resin basis light weighting consumer packaging has been a headwind to the reported volumes as we look more as we look to make more sustainable products will this have a measurable impacted the way you report the volumes in these segments thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer it s a fair commentary there s not a perfect unit to measure inside our business but we re not doing this just to affect the metric the reality is if we can make products better more cost effective meeting the feature needs and benefits for our end customers we will do it we re doing at engineered materials by our expertise at material science we re doing in hhs by our ability to combine non wovens with breathable film technology a compliment of the most recent clopay acquisition but yes it s an ongoing effort to define the best unit of measurement that can best reflect the progress that we re making toward growth and we ll continue to seek out what those are but there is not a perfect one in our business given the diversity of what we do salvator tiano vertical analyst great thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of gabe hajde from wells fargo securities your line is open gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst good morning gentlemen thanks for taking the question to revisit the china commentary tom that you made specific to hh s notwithstanding any ripple effect that i guess this virus may have on the economy or sentiment should we interpret that that it would be a net positive to volumes in hh s to the extent that this persists thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer i would i think it s too early to say that it s going to be a net positive the two plants that are manufacturing the majority of those materials are nanhai facility and suzhou facility but it s just it s a little too early to say what that will be it all really depends how long this health crisis lasts in some instances we re ultimately deferring the production of other materials to support the healthcare product to support the need that both china and the world economy has relative to shortages in those product lines i ll say none of our plants right now are ultimately closed so there s a variety of facilities no they are continue to serve local markets i think we ll continue to serve the local chinese market people need to continue to eat people need to continue to do those things that they do to support their everyday life as a component of our overall portfolio but a little too soon to say i m just proud of our team s ability to provide these kind of products ultimately to meet what is an unfortunate demand right now gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst no understood you ve made a couple of comments in the past couple of quarters about the dispensing systems business within the acquired rpc operations i was curious if now you ve had a couple of quarters to look underneath the tent here where that business had historically been successful and what type of investment might be necessary to expand it is this a function of really installing some assembly equipment here or maybe domestically and maybe even something where you can co locate operations and then i guess get some commercial folks in place or what timeline or anything you can give us on that front would be helpful thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer yeah it s one of the most attractive parts of the rpc acquisition combining rpc s closure dispensing business with berry s creates close to 2 billion business for berry and the team right now is prioritizing around their innovation pipeline to get it commercialized as quickly as possible secondly where they have commercialized around pharmaceutical around healthcare how we can deploy those existing application and parts to other regions of the world so it s really part of the of that global value delivery capability that we are hyper focused on i will say in general the level of investment to support this business was outstanding from an automation perspective from a converting equipment perspective it s really about making certain that we get more of that pipeline commercialized faster consistent with what we talked about in our overall strategy which is investing in an advantage products and targeted markets and deploying the resources and capital against it but we re excited about that business and that is a our objective clearly is to be a global leader in closures and dispensing solutions gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst great thank you for that and last one if i can squeeze in can you remind us on the i guess versalite product given the decline in polypropylene is that more of a cost competitive product now and something that you still having dialogue with customers on for hot cup applications thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer we continue to have questions we continue to enjoy business we ve made great strides relative to the cost of that substrate our portfolio of customers that enjoy today in our pipeline is robust i ll leave it at that and it s robust with the majors so we continue to believe it s one of the world s most advanced drink cup solutions and our existing customers continue to enjoy its benefit and there s a pipeline of new opportunity for us to consider gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst thank you good luck operator our next question comes from the line of adam josephson from keybanc your line is open adam josephson keybanc analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions i appreciate it mark just one on rpc volumes i know you said they were slightly down in the two quarters you ve owned them can you just give us some context as to what they ve been i think they were flat in the quarter to beforehand and then they had been i think growing low single digits over the past few years if memory serves can you just talk to us about what our rpc s volume trends have been over the past few years because i know the european economy is not great but it has it s been in a malaise for many years now so i m just i guess trying to understand what if anything has changed from the days when rpc was up low single digits thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer sure yeah i think adam the progression i think you laid it out pretty accurately plus 1 plus 2 and as a reminder they reported every six months so quarter to quarter i don t know that i ve look at closely to figure out volatility within the quarter so i hesitate getting too excited about one quarter s performance but yes starting under various ownership first q1 or two quarters in first quarter was flat this quarter was down 3 so for the first six months we re essentially flat down 1 on volumes then i wouldn t say there s been any significant change other than what we called out weakness in some of the european markets here in the most recent quarter but again as we pointed out too early to call how long this will last we just want to be prudent in our approach and call out that it is weaker at the moment but that could certainly change as the clock roils forward adam josephson keybanc analyst sure and just one on resin mark i know you mentioned year over year prices are down quite a bit it flew through your sales line how much of a benefit to your ebitda was resin in the quarter and what if any changes are you expecting on resin prices polypro and polyethylene for the balance of the fiscal year and just what s your outlook on supply demand in those markets mark w miles chief financial officer yeah as a reminder of resin is a pass through for us so the fact that resin is down year over year has reflected in a lower top line but that s also a lower price for our customers right so it makes our products less expensive for our customers so in terms of impact on our profitability not that significant as it pass through to our customers in terms of outlook i think tom may have mentioned this in some earlier answers but it s been relatively stable up down up 0 01 or 0 02 a month but it s been a pretty stable market here in the recent history adam josephson keybanc analyst and you are expecting no change for the balance of the fiscal year i assume in your guidance along those lines mark w miles chief financial officer yeah we re expecting a relatively stable market for resin going forward which on cash flow i should point out as well that would be a modest tailwind to the extent resin does stay benign but again early in the year so we re not adjusting at this stage adam josephson keybanc analyst perfect thank you mark mark w miles chief financial officer thank you operator our last question comes from the line of george staphos from boa your line is open george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi guys thanks for taking the follow on to late i ll make it quick can you let us know or remind us what are the next one or two steps relative to any new materials requalifying and filling the pipeline in line with your targets to hit your guidance and or within your guidance and then relately could remind us what s in the 150 million of spending for this segment over the next three years what are you basically when it s all said and done what will that segment look like how ll it be different how ll it be more competitive so on so forth thank you guys good luck in the quarter thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer sure the onboarding remains on track we ve completed over 50 of the new opportunities that have become commercialized we ll do the remaining 50 here in this quarter and into the june quarter to kind of round out the whole year the good news george it s not cast in stone so it s very dynamic and we continue to add to that pipeline and that ultimately is what we re most excited about that they continue to add onto the pipeline side of engineered material that gives us support for beyond 2020 we are making investments inside that business just to make certain that we ve got the tactical app to know how from everything to support more automation inside that business so that we ultimately can prioritize our human capital around the most value added applications inside of the business to support some which i can t describe specifically converting technologies that will give us advantages relative to composition of products materials science and the overall cost of conversion inside that space george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you very much operator i would now like to turn the call back to the company for final comments thomas e salmon chairman and chief executive officer very good i want to thank everybody for your interest in our q1 results look forward to speaking to you next quarter thank you operator duration 69 minutes
