this article is more than 4 years old evan vucci associated press president trump has brazil all wrong and the market seems to think so as well because the country s stock market is beating the s p 500 and the rest of the emerging markets index again on wednesday the self described tariff man reinstated tariffs on brazilian steel on tuesday he blamed a weak brazilian real for his decision saying the weakened currency makes brazilian steel more attractive to world markets a weaker currency definitely makes brazilian goods more price competitive but despite the currency weakening significantly since late july going from r 3 72 on july 18 to a five year low of r 4 23 on november 29 brazil s revenue from steel exports is in decline brazil s economic minister paulo guedes a market fave said today that trump was making a very serious mistake in accusing brazil of deliberately pushing down the value of its currency the brazil steelers depending on the product line and product code set by the brazilian foreign trade ministry export value of semi manufactured steel products fell 21 67 in november worldwide steel laminate exports fell even more by 51 year to date exports of steel products have not been helped by the foreign exchange rate semi manufactured steel exports fell 15 9 steel laminate exports are down 18 the brazilian real is down roughly 8 against the dollar year to date so these values are not all due to a weaker currency eating up export profits jim mone associated press the u s is the no 2 destination for brazilian goods after china steel products are second only to crude oil but like crude oil steel shipment values are also down from january to november the u s imported 12 7 less worth of brazilian steel over an 11 month period than a year ago totaling 2 5 billion all told brazil exports to the u s for the year are up 2 7 to 26 9 billion helped along primarily by a surge in gasoline ethanol and coffee bean exports not steel china is not a a major steel importer it produces its own steel and instead buys the iron ore pellets used to make steel china imported 21 more iron ore from brazil so far this year according to the foreign trade ministry brazil s other top trading partners are not importing ship loads of steel either holland brazil s no 3 export market saw a 0 5 increase in certain steel products such as steel rebar for a total of 1 02 billion perhaps trump is looking at mexico imports of semi manufactured steel that s a top 10 export market for brazil and steel sales rose 26 7 to 157 million spain increased its purchase of brazilian steel this year too rising 21 4 to 54 million it is unclear if any of these buyers sourced from brazil instead of the u s but even if they did this happens worldwide every day in market economies what should worry trump if anything is more brazilian steel coming into the united states at the expense of local producers according to gerdau a brazilian multinational steel producer with steel mills in the u s volume of brazilian steel shipments in the third quarter fell 17 volumes of steel shipments over the last 9 months compared to the same period a year ago fell 20 1 see market totally ignores brazil tariffs forbes bloomberg the weaker real is not helping brazilian steel trump said the weaker real makes brazilian soy more competitive to the detriment to american farmers brazilian soybeans are priced in dollars the only price differential is due to brazil s logistical cost which sometimes makes brazilian soy more expensive in dollar terms brazil s weaker currency does not give it a pricing power beyond what brazil has always had in comparison to the u s the brazilian real averages at least two times cheaper than the dollar like in the u s china is brazil s largest soy buyer china is basically boycotting u s soy and buying more brazilian soy taking the u s out of the top spot as world s leading soybean exporter that s not brazil s fault unless trump thinks brazilian agribusiness firms should tell the chinese to buy from their american friends instead brazil s soy export boom of last year is because china turned away from the u s in revenge for trump s trade war this year is not turning out as well in terms of revenue soy exports to china in dollar terms are down 23 8 year to date to 19 5 billion rodolfo buhrer associated press agroconsult a brazilian agribusiness market intelligence firm estimates that china imports of brazilian soybeans will decline in this next harvest by around 10 brazil s currency not the renminbi this year the u s treasury went against its long standing tradition of refraining from calling china a currency manipulator this week trump hinted that brazil was practicing competitive devaluations in order to make its currency weaker so now brazil is a currency manipulator of sorts no one in the market believes for a second that brazil manipulates their forex market in 2008 months before the collapse of lehman brothers and bear stearns brazil s finance minister at the time guido mantega lamented the brazilian real trading at a strong r 1 60 to the dollar mantega famously said the u s was engaging in a currency war with the weak dollar then the market collapsed the great recession hit and all emerging market currencies tumbled the currency war was forgotten until around 2011 when quantitative easing was in full effect the real strengthened again to around r 1 55 in intraday trading in june of that year it was the strongest the brazilian real has ever been the real weakened over the next several years for a number of factors including more money flowing into the advanced economies thanks to the fed and european central bank and a growing political crisis in brazil that led to an economic crisis brazil is only now clawing its way out of its own great recession andrew harrer 2017 bloomberg finance lp the brazilian central bank intervened twice in the forex market last week selling between 2 billion to 3 billion to avoid an even weaker currency it was the first intervention in the spot market since 2009 but it clearly triggered trump the real has weakened this year for good reasons says jan dehn head of research for the ashmore group a 95 billion asset manager primarily invested in emerging market debt local interest rates have declined to the lowest level ever thanks to declining inflation rates and a full restoration of central bank credibility under the new government low rates have in turn allowed companies to repay dollar denominated debt and borrow in local currency at similar levels of interest rates instead this has led to an increase in the demand for dollars to repay debt more demand for dollars means less demand for reals as companies sell reals to buy dollars to pay back loans that s pushing the currency lower in the short term dehn says the brazilian real also weakened recently for pure technical reasons investors went long the real in anticipation of large foreign direct investment into the oil and gas sector in the recent concessions the auction was a success for petrobras which secured the right to operate very productive assets however foreign participation was slim only 10 of one field which left currency speculators frustrated he notes as expectations for dollar inflows into brazil s oil and gas market fell flat the unwinding of the bullish real bet coincided with well known year end seasonal dividend remittances and then the currency took another hit from a data release which showed brazil s trade deficit was growing when it really was not last week november export numbers were corrected showing the trade balance is in surplus to the tune of 37 6 billion year to date that surplus is not to the detriment of u s steel manufacturers or the u s farmer as trump believes the u s has an 8 1 billion trade surplus with brazil according to census data the problem is china tariffs on u s soy leading to what amounts to bans on chinese companies buying american soy they ve turned to brazil american steel may have its own issues that have little to do with brazil trump and his commerce department have provided no words on brazil flooding the u s with cheap steel products how long before trump rescinds these tariffs on brazilian steel is anybody s guess brazil was exempted from steel and aluminum tariffs in may 2018 and never really put in place to begin with quotas were put in place instead to change the quotas to tariffs would require new presidential proclamations as tariffs can t be reimposed by a tweet at this writing we are still awaiting these proclamations says paul nathanson executive director of the coalition of american metal manufacturers and users if the president does move forward with these tariffs it would likely lead to an immediate legal challenge he says a current u s court of international trade case on steel tariffs involves an earlier decision by president trump to raise the so called section 232 steel tariff on turkey to 50 the court ruled against the president s actions against turkey because he did not give a reason for raising the tariff only on turkish steel and he did not follow proper procedures in issuing the proclamation on the matter nathanson says it might be for this reason that wall street doesn t seem too worried about brazilian steel being roadblocked at the ports by trump

relatively few appear to have noticed that central banks have moved to the front lines of the climate fight bank of canada governor stephen poloz took it upon himself to raise the subject while on stage at an event in toronto last month hosted by the ontario securities commission after neither the moderator nor a single audience member asked him a question about climate change even though the theme of the event was emerging risks there is no greater emerging threat than the warming of the planet almost 200 countries have signed the 2015 paris agreement yet collectively they have failed to stop the growth in global ghg emissions meaning that deeper and faster cuts are now required the united nations environment programme said in its annual emissions gap report published november 26 in geneva nations must cut pollution in half by 2030 to meet the paris target of keeping the temperature from rising by more than 1 5 degrees celsius over that time the report said that will require a dramatic change in behaviour as emissions have increased by an average of about 1 5 percent annually over the past decade according to bloomberg climate change continues to pose risks to both the economy and the financial system the bank of canada said in may when it formally added global warming to its list of vulnerabilities that make the economy susceptible to a financial crisis more recently the central bank published an article that states explicitly that climate change is transforming the economy and financial system the international monetary fund is even blunter simply put climate is the biggest risk the world faces gita bhatt editor in chief of finance development the fund s in house magazine writes in a prelude to the current issue although the canadian public may be mostly unaware that the climate has become a priority of central banks people at the alberta treasury are acutely conscious of the fact

a further incentive for households to take on even more debt benjamin reitzes bank of montreal imagine what could have happened to canada s infamous household debt levels had the bank of canada cut interest rates today the central bank didn t trim its benchmark overnight rate from 1 75 per cent but imagine how consumer debt burdens could have become even more problematic if it did and it s still an issue given that some observers still expect a rate cut at some point next year consumer debt is one of the reasons seen as holding back the bank of canada which has refused to join the rush among the world s central banks to ease monetary policy there are other reasons to be sure largely the performance of parts of canada s economy though some analysts believe central bank governor stephen poloz senior deputy governor carolyn wilkins and their colleagues will eventually cut their key rate as insurance amid economic uncertainty driven largely by global trade tensions household debt is a well known issue in canada and was a key reason why the bank of canada held policy rates steady through the first seven policy meetings of 2019 benjamin reitzes bank of montreal s canadian rates and macro strategist said in a report on the recent rise in mortgage borrowing while recent speeches from boc officials suggest they believe the macroprudential regulatory changes are improving the quality of debt burdens the bank will likely be watching the acceleration in mortgage credit growth carefully he added at 4 5 per cent year over year the rate of borrowing to buy a home is up more than one percentage point over the past six months which is why as mr reitzes put it the bank of canada will be wary of providing a further incentive for households to take on even more debt indeed the central bank said today that it continues to monitor the evolution of financial vulnerabilities related to the household sector canadian debt levels were among the fattest in the world and came under scrutiny and warnings from observers the world over the situation has indeed improved helped along by new federal mortgage qualification stress tests that came into effect in early 2018 but then look at what bmo s findings tell us about more recently and consider that the key ratio of household credit market debt to disposable income on a seasonally adjusted basis stood at 177 1 per cent in the second quarter that means canadians owe 1 77 for each dollar at their disposal that number is better than what we ve seen but is still elevated which is why it s such a concern to the central bank this is the financial vulnerabilities portion of the boc s conundrum on an insurance cut said rbc dominion securities rates strategist simon deely and his colleague mark chandler head of canadian rates strategy any easing would likely be followed by a rise in the debt to income ratio they added in their lookahead to today s decision according to a report tuesday from canada mortgage and

tests came into effect but pushed higher into this year ms shaker and mr batch said adding that moved in line with the national trend in sales of homes on the plus side average credit scores increased in the second quarter and default rates have remained low and fairly stable across most credit types over the last four years with the exception of auto loans where delinquencies have been rising signaling that consumers with such loans face greater stress paying off debt on time but as the globe and mail s matt lundy reports consumer insolvencies in canada rose in october to their highest level since the financial crisis this horse appears already to have left its barn brett house and alena bystrova bank of nova scotia here s what observers said on the debt issue before today s statement in recent communications the bank of canada s senior leadership has noted its concern that any move to cut rates could set off a new flurry of household borrowing this horse appears already to have left its barn and businesses that finance their operations at the shorter end of the market are paying rates higher than the belly of the curve the canadian economy remains too reliant on real estate investment for growth but the current mix of short term and longer term yields isn t aligned to change this brett house deputy chief economist and alena bystrova senior research analyst bank of nova scotia we expect the bank of canada to leave its key policy rate unchanged next week as fears of stoking the flames of the resurgent housing market outweigh the risk that economic growth will slow by more than expected this quarter paul ashworth chief north america economist capital economics the boc opting against an insurance cut in october implicitly suggests that they are willing to tolerate this small stable output gap to avoid exacerbating household debt vulnerabilities however a small but persistent widening would likely be another story the boc s projection already has a repeat 1 3 per cent gain in q4 i e still below potential growth so this could be a slow developing story rbc s mr deeley and mr chandler if there is one big downside risk the global slowdown there are a number of smaller factors telling the to hold tight first housing activity has rebounded smartly in b c and ontario as the plunge in longer term bond yields this year has done much of the work for the bank at the same time mortgage credit growth has accelerated again at just over 4 per cent it s not flashing warning signs but the turnaround has reduced the impetus to ease robert kavcic senior economist bmo in our view the stars are aligned for further strengthening of the canadian housing market due to lower mortgage rates the addition of about 300 000 full time jobs so far this year and one of the strongest household formation rates among industrialized countries sébastien lavoie chief economist laurentian bank securities the boc may be too worried about inflaming housing and mortgage markets this time like it did when it eased in 2015 obviously worry in itself is legitimate given the history of bubbles often induced by monetary policy but the question at hand is whether cutting the policy rate would further inflame housing mortgage and housing markets recovered in many areas this year in part because a globally correlated bond rally drove fixed mortgage rates lower including the key five year fixed rate cutting the variable rate once or twice is unlikely to do more than to remove a front end kink in the rates curve rather than drive a flood of variable rate activity derek holt head of capital markets economics bank of nova scotia read more boc holds steady as noted the central bank held its key rate steady with a statement that pushed the canadian dollar above 75 5 us cents future interest rate decisions will be guided by the bank s continuing assessment of the adverse impact of trade conflicts against the sources of resilience in the canadian economy notably consumer spending and housing activity the central bank said fiscal policy developments will also figure into the bank s updated outlook in january as for the world backdrop which is so key to the bank of canada s stance the central bank cited nascent evidence that the global economy is stabilizing with growth still expected to edge higher over the next couple of years and as for canada it noted that economic growth slowed in the third quarter to an annual pace of 1 3 per cent but highlighted stronger business investment today s statement dialed back the dovish rhetoric of the prior statement and as such suggests that the boc is pretty firmly on hold for now said cibc world markets senior economist andrew grantham the statement overall was maybe a little more hawkish than markets were expecting and investors will now be dialing back the probability of a boc interest rate cut in the near term which has seen bond yields rise he added read more home sales surge and on that note

google ceo sundar pichai will now take on a dual role as ceo of the umbrella company alphabet thus overseeing both parts of the business what this means for the overall business is not immediately clear however in the short term it s quite likely that very little will change given that both will still retain their seats on the board as well as their controlling stakes in the company michael hewson chief analyst cmc markets larry page was clearly unwilling to participate in this more political phase in the growth of google and its parent company alphabet alphabet shares have had a stellar year with sundar pichai at the helm of google and we think investors will welcome the continuity pichai is not the kind of outspoken ceo to take on politicians and regulators out in the open that could be his undoing when the rising number of tax and competition probes lead to more public appearances more likely though pichai can rely on behind the scene strategizing and lobbying to end up

trump s misguided international trade strategy international trade is really about national security j c scull follow 8 min read nov 16 2019 1 share photo by geronimo giqueaux on unsplash international trade international trade policies are as controversial among economists as they are among politicians the reason is that there is much at stake not only in regards to jobs but also in the cost of consumer products intellectual property rights inflation and even national security what makes trade policies so contentious is that any one particular action can cause an economic measurement to rise while another one may fall for example cheap imports help to bring down inflation but can cause unemployment in certain areas of the economy while some manufacturing jobs are lost retail jobs increase due to higher consumer purchases also lower prices benefit the poor and the middle class as they are able to afford products they would normally not be able to buy this allows them to spend money on other items eventually further benefiting the economy however this increase in spending on foreign made products also increases our debt to other countries the above descriptions only represent a minute part of the total complexity of international trade making this subject a difficult one to come to any sort of general consensus

tariffs is not shared by federal reserve chairman jerome powell who has said they are making executives so uncertain about the outlook that companies are delaying investments and slowing the economy likewise the us28 billion in tariff revenue that trump has earmarked for farmers hurt by his trade war is effectively a tax paid by other americans and now amounts to more than twice the 2009 bailout of the us auto industry trump s action against brazil and argentina took officials in both countries by surprise typically the us provides businesses with some warning of tariff changes delaying their effective date to allow goods in transit to arrive at american ports without being taxed but the president tweeted that his tariff order was effective immediately global markets were shaken by the escalating trade tensions credit ap in a sign of how abruptly trump had acted his own administration was unprepared to provide details the white house referred questions about the new policy to the commerce department which referred a reporter back to the white house officials at the customs and border protection agency which collects tariffs from importers referred a reporter to lighthizer s office which did not respond to a request for comment commerce secretary wilbur ross told fox business even our friends must live by the rules our best allies must live by the rules what the president was concerned about was deterioration of the brazilian currency that is a fair factor to take into account it s a real factor the lower their currency the cheaper products coming in he felt he had to do something about it they are not the only one where there are currency issues for the moment i don t know that china is such a bad problem with currency but they have been in the past it s not clear what rules the president believes brazil or argentina has violated brazil s economy over the past year has barely grown advancing at an annual rate of just 0 2 per cent the brazilian central bank has cut interest rates three times since august in a bid to jump start growth as a consequence the brazilian currency the real has fallen about 8 per cent this year against the dollar argentina meanwhile is mired in a financial crisis that has left its economy smaller today than it was four years ago and resulted in a humiliating rescue from the international monetary fund as investors fled the currency this year lost 37 per cent of its value the argentine central bank has hiked its main interest rate to 63 per cent in a bid to halt the decline everybody is moving their money out of argentina said desmond lachman an economist at the american enterprise institute and a former imf official i m not sure what he wants the government to do there is no evidence that either country s currency moves are designed to gain an unfair trade edge according to economists and financial market experts these things are signs of a very sick patient not signs of a robust economy said marc chandler chief market strategist for bannockburn global forex the whole region is on fire brazil s us4 9 billion in exports to the us over the past two months were almost 2 per cent lower than during the same period in 2018 the president also renewed his assault on the federal reserve on monday tweeting that it should likewise act so that countries of which there are many no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies falling currencies abroad act like a price increase on american exports this makes it very hard for our manufactures farmers to fairly export their goods lower rates loosen fed the president tweeted loading for months the fed has been the target of the president s ire for raising interest rates as the economy strengthened but fed chairman jerome powell reversed course at the end of july citing the effects of the president s trade war on business confidence and investment negotiations with china over a partial trade deal are only crawling forward almost two months after trump called reporters to the oval office to announce he had reached an agreement in principle with beijing likewise a new north american trade deal awaits congressional approval months after the administration hoped it would be finished
ein news calgary alberta dec 04 2019 globe newswire commenting on the company s 2020 budget steve laut executive vice chairman of canadian natural stated canadian natural s ability to generate

driven by our large long life low decline asset base effective and efficient operations disciplined capital allocation and a strong balance sheet our 2020 capital budget of 4 05 billion delivers targeted production of approximately 1 172 000 boe d at mid point of guidance resulting in approximately 9 production per share growth in a curtailed environment as we allocate capital to the highest return projects and progress projects that add production and value in 2020 and beyond these targeted 2020 volumes assume that the alberta government curtailment program will continue throughout 2020 and as a result 2020 targeted production is 10 000 bbl d to 25 000 bbl d less than it would have been without the curtailment program we will continue to manage within our curtailment optimization strategy and target to maintain capital flexibility by aligning production growth with improved market access we are hopeful that the curtailment levels will be reduced or eliminated as we progress through 2020 safe reliable and low cost operations continue to be a focus for the company as we capture synergies increase margins and maximize value for our shareholders in 2020 and beyond due to the alberta government s recently announced elimination of curtailment for certain conventional drilling in alberta and its previously announced reduction in income tax rates canadian natural has

reliability which combined with continuous improvement will drive margin growth in 2020 natural gas production guidance is targeted to range between 1 360 mmcf d to 1 420 mmcf d as the company s

conventional drilling in alberta and its previously announced reduction in income tax rates canadian natural has increased its 2020 capital budget by approximately 250 million over 2019 levels adding approximately 60 drilling locations across alberta and putting 3 additional drilling rigs to work creating an additional approximate 1 000 full time equivalent jobs for albertans if the alberta

calgary alberta dec 04 2019 globe newswire commenting on the company s 2020 budget steve laut executive vice chairman of canadian natural stated canadian natural s ability to generate significant and sustainable free cash flow sets us apart from our peers our focus on capital discipline as a part of our four pillars of capital allocation operational excellence and leveraging our competitive advantages drives economic asset development significant margin growth and a strong balance sheet canadian natural s president tim mckay added the company is unique sustainable and robust driven by our large long life low decline asset base effective and efficient operations disciplined capital allocation and a strong balance sheet our 2020 capital budget of 4 05 billion delivers targeted production of approximately 1 172 000 boe d at mid point of guidance resulting in approximately 9 production per share growth in a curtailed environment as we allocate capital to the highest return projects and progress projects that add production and value in 2020 and beyond these targeted 2020 volumes assume that the alberta government curtailment program will continue throughout 2020 and as a result 2020 targeted production is 10 000 bbl d to 25 000 bbl d less than it would have been without the curtailment program we will continue to manage within our curtailment optimization strategy and target to maintain capital flexibility by aligning production growth with improved market access we are hopeful that the curtailment levels will be reduced or eliminated as we progress through 2020 safe reliable and low cost operations continue to be a focus for the company as we capture synergies increase margins and maximize value for our shareholders in 2020 and beyond due to the alberta government s recently announced elimination of curtailment for certain conventional drilling in alberta and its previously announced reduction in income tax rates canadian natural has increased its 2020 capital budget by approximately 250 million over 2019 levels adding approximately 60 drilling locations across alberta and putting 3 additional drilling rigs to work creating an additional approximate 1 000 full time equivalent jobs for albertans canadian natural s chief financial officer mark stainthorpe continued in 2020 our commitment to maintain a strong financial position is supported by a disciplined capital program ample liquidity and effective and efficient operations free cash flow in 2020 is targeted to be approximately 4 8 billion based on current strip wti pricing and stable differentials relative to 2019 based upon such pricing assumptions according to canadian natural s free cash flow allocation policy the company targets to allocate after current dividend requirements approximately 2 4 billion to share repurchases and approximately 2 4 billion towards strengthening the balance sheet as a result the company s year end debt metrics are targeted to strengthen further throughout 2020 to approximately 1 6x debt to adjusted ebitda and approximately 35 debt to book capitalization at year end our financial strength gives us the flexibility to deliver on our plan and continue to drive long term shareholder value highlights of the 2020 budget the company s large balanced and diverse asset base is complemented by an extensive network of owned and operated infrastructure and is supported by a deep inventory of long life low decline assets and conventional and unconventional assets the company is focused on enhanced margin growth and high return on capital projects that can deliver leading free cash flow with production and value growth opportunities canadian natural s 2020 capital budget is targeted to be 4 05 billion of which approximately 1 55 billion is allocated to conventional and unconventional assets and approximately 2 5 billion is allocated to long life low decline assets overall production in 2020 is targeted to be between 1 137 000 boe d and 1 207 000 boe d with a product mix of approximately 80 crude oil synthetic crude oil sco and ngls and approximately 20 natural gas these targeted 2020 volumes assume that the alberta government curtailment program will continue throughout 2020 and as a result 2020 targeted production is 10 000 bbl d to 25 000 bbl d less than it would have been without the curtailment program overall 2020 crude oil sco and ngl production is targeted to grow approximately 9 from 2019 levels and approximately 13 on a per share basis ranging from 910 000 bbl d to 970 000 bbl d long life low decline production is targeted to be approximately 77 of liquids production production is targeted to ramp up at the company s kirby north steam assisted gravity drainage sagd project throughout 2020 reaching targeted production capability of 40 000 bbl d in early 2021 at jackfish sagd production from pad additions with targeted production capability of approximately 21 000 bbl d will ramp up within curtailment levels with peak production targeted to be reached in 2022 at the company s oil sands mining upgrading assets canadian natural is targeting continued strong reliability which combined with continuous improvement will drive margin growth in 2020 natural gas production guidance is targeted to range between 1 360 mmcf d to 1 420 mmcf d as the company s natural gas capital investment in 2020 focuses on strategic land retention for future value generation due to the alberta government s recently announced elimination of curtailment for certain conventional drilling in alberta and its previously announced reduction in income tax rates canadian natural has increased its 2020 capital budget by approximately 250 million over 2019 levels adding approximately 60 drilling locations across alberta and putting 3 additional drilling rigs to work creating an additional approximate 1 000 full time equivalent jobs for albertans if the alberta government expanded the elimination of curtailment to include newly drilled conventional heavy oil wells canadian natural would look to put an additional 6 drilling rigs to work in alberta production and capital guidance

innovation in doha qatar foundation as you fly into doha and cast your eyes over the gleaming towers of west bay or the striking new facilities emerging on a daily basis both in central doha and education city it can appear incredulous to countenance qatar as a nation afflicted by the resource curse indeed it s gdp per capita of 72 700 marks it out as one of the wealthiest nations on earth yet in an economy whereby 60 of gdp and 85 of exports are derived from oil and gas the need to diversify is evident not least due to the decline in oil prices since 2014 that many believe is the new normal and the political and economic blockade that was imposed by some neighboring countries in june 2017 the concept of the resource curse emerged a few hundred years before the term was first coined by economist richard auty the term describes the apparent difficulty many countries that have abundant natural resources have in terms of growing their economy institutions and macroeconomic policies in resource rich arab economies a new book by kamiar mohaddes jeffrey b nugent and hoda selim explores the topic through the particular lens of the six arab nations that make up the gulf cooperation council the authors argue that the challenges imposed by the resource curse are not so much due to the price volatility of the resource itself but rather weak institutions qatar have attempted to overcome this via the creation of the qatar foundation in 1995 which aimed to unlock the human potential of the nation via education innovation and entrepreneurship in the two decades since the institution was forged they believe that the foundations for success have been established with the centrepiece being the education city district that houses the educational scientific and entrepreneurial efforts of the city unlocking human potential the 12 square km education city is home to a wide range of k12 and higher education facilities including seven international campuses from institutions such as northwestern texas a m and carnegie mellon universities with hec paris then offering executive mbas from its campus in west bay rather than providing a full range of programs each university specializes in particular disciplines so that each campus provides a complementary rather than competitive experience the international universities are complemented by qatar s own hamad bin khalifa university which offers a range of research and graduate programs collectively there are over 3 000 students from over 60 nations on campus undertaking 55 programs these facilities help to fulfill the ultimate ambition of the project to create good jobs for the citizens of qatar by equipping them with the skills they need to thrive in the future of work qatar science and technology park qatar foundation the campus is complemented by a wide range of facilities that aim to capture and combine the knowledge produced on campus via a range of dedicated research facilities qatar foundation research development and innovation strives to develop innovative solutions both for the unique challenges faced by the nation but also those of the wider world the centrepiece of the institute is the qatar science technology park which brings together applied research and technology innovation incubation and entrepreneurship the park which has been operating for a decade has created a free zone and business park to encourage multinationals to rub shoulders with researchers and startups to generate technology driven businesses the park aims to support enterprises at all stages of their development from early stage product development via the incubation center to venture capital and joint r d projects for more advanced startups to date 20 startups have been created and sit alongside over 50 multinational companies including cisco microsoft general electric and a who s who of the global oil and gas community core sectors the park is bordered by a range of biomedical innovation facilities including the qatar biobank and genome programme and the cutting edge sidra medicine teaching and research hospital specializing in women s and children s health these projects sit alongside the national ai strategy that was published recently with biomedicine and precision medicine one of the pillars of the strategy to date over 15 000 qataris have had their genomes sequenced as part of the qatar biobank project with the ultimate aim to ensure all citizens have their genomes sequenced in what is hoped will be the world s leading repository of arab genomic data in the world this will feed into the country s precision medicine program that underpins the qatari national health strategy 2018 2022 which strives to take a more preventative and community based approach to medicine and healthcare this is especially important as the country suffers disproportionately from lifestyle related conditions such as diabetes and obesity with nearly 70 of mortalities occurring from these conditions room to grow how effective have these efforts been in driving the qatari economy the results to date have been mixed there is no doubt that the city is awash with incredibly impressive facilities but as mohaddes et al highlight the inefficient spending patterns that are common in oil rich countries combined with insufficient public scrutiny results in significant waste while it s not clear that qatar has personally been beset by waste or more mendaciously fraudulent behavior the output from the considerable investments has been modest indeed many of the gleaming facilities are crying out for the throngs of people and energy that most characterize the very best innovation hubs around the world this is undoubtedly a long term project and while the economic realities of the country do allow for a long term investment approach to be taken there remains uncertainty about whether the oil price slump and the economic blockade have provided a sufficiently significant burning platform to trigger the kind of changes required to truly shift the economy away from hydrocarbon based industries indeed while direct revenue from oil and gas fell to below 50 of gdp in 2017 from 60 1 in 2011 this hides the fact that much of the other half of the economy is heavily reliant on the oil and gas sector for its revenues this is reflected in the 80 of exports that are accounted for by hydrocarbons nordic noir oslo city hall from aker brygge marina oslo norway getty norway has been in a similar situation since oil and gas deposits were discovered in the north sea shelf in the 1960s since then oil and gas has regularly contributed around 20 of national gdp with figures in 2012 revealing that the petroleum sector constituted 23 of gdp 30 of government revenues and 52 of total exports with estimates that nearly half of the petroleum resources on the norwegian shelf have been produced however it s clear that diversification of the economy is necessary the factors prevalent during the dutch disease of the 1960s have also been evident in norway as high oil revenues led to increased public consumption which in turn led to higher domestic costs indeed in 2012 hourly wage costs in the manufacturing sector were 69 higher than the european union average and while this can t account for the entire decline in norwegian manufacturing it has undoubtedly played a part nonetheless research comparing norway s economic performance with that of sweden who are in many ways comparable albeit with no oil and gas reserves to speak of found that even accounting for petroleum based revenue the norwegians were doing better than their scandinavian neighbors so how did they do this research from the university of oslo suggests the quality of norway s political institutions is a major factor with strong protection of property rights reliable public bureaucracy and minimal corruption all contributing to robust economic growth indeed the global innovation index produced each year by insead and wipo places norway in 19th place with the quality of their institutions ranked 2nd in the entire world oslo startup lab startup lab this contrasts noticeably with qatar who linger in 65th place in the index and are a noticeable outlier in the high income countries covered by the report for their poor performance qatari institutions perform particularly poorly with the overall business environment ranked down in 91st place globally which coupled with poor performance in primary and secondary education and the investment landscape hamper their attempts to diversify the economy successfully institutional advantage the relative advantage norway enjoys is therefore partly explained by the fact that the country already had a long and stable tradition of democratic rule by the time oil was discovered this has allowed the country to not only attempt to sustain some of the success historically achieved in manufacturing but flesh out complimentary prominence in related areas such as shipbuilding and geological services for instance the katapult ocean aims to build on the country s rich nautical heritage to encourage entrepreneurship in areas such as ocean health and aquaculture while the startuplabs accelerator specialize in industrial iot startups that build upon the engineering expertise established after extracting oil and gas from the north sea over the past 50 years in many ways the slump in oil prices since 2014 have been a boon to the startup scene in oslo as so many engineers have either voluntarily or otherwise chosen to deploy their talents in non oil disciplines with many choosing to create startups as recent research from mit reminds us older entrepreneurs are often better equipped to handle the rigors of startup life not least because they have well developed networks from their career to date that can be tapped into when growing the business this is certainly the case in norway where many of the corporate partners required to prove the merits of an idea are the large oil and gas companies so many of the entrepreneurs have left despite this there are clear challenges in attracting the best talent away from the relative comfort and security of a well paid job in the oil and gas sector when comparing the regular income provided by such work with the high levels of uncertainty inherent in entrepreneurial life and it can be challenging to make the leap especially when one has family responsibilities and a mortgage to pay this can be compounded by government policies that continue to tax stock options highly if we re to truly diversify from oil and gas then it really is all about talent and ensuring we have the best skills possible alexander woxen founding partner and ceo of the startuplabs accelerator told me recently so access to talent is really a key value driver and what can prevent us from growing and the tax system is really not helping us to square the opportunity cost considerations people inevitably have when thinking about leaving their job the region has had a degree of success with companies like freyr raising several million to build a giga factory in the rana municipality but even this has largely been overshadowed by neighboring northvolt with the swedish green battery company raising 1 billion to help develop its own facility in skelleftea curating inspiration so what lessons can be learned from both countries a recent paper from stanford s nicholas bloom recently highlighted five things that hey believes are crucial to the development of successful innovation ecosystems r d tax incentives with their data suggesting that reducing the cost of r d by 10 results in an increase in innovation by 10 norwegian companies can apply for a 20 deduction in r d costs with qatar offering complete tax exemption for activities conducted at the qatar science and technology park promote free trade with research published last year highlighting how valuable free trade can be to innovation especially in the medium term this is an area that norway has an obvious advantage in as a member of the european economic area provides access to the european single market whereas qatar is blocked off from neighboring economies support skilled migration with research showing that an increase in overseas college graduates of just 1 can increase the number of patents per capita by 18 norway benefits from free movement from across the eu and while not without hurdles for non eu citizens is a diverse and welcoming country qatar has arguably gone even further with just 10 of the qatari population native although with just 44 of the population having completed upper secondary school education they lack the high skill levels seen in other rapidly advancing countries train workers in stem fields with a number of policy options to improve the number of people studying a science technology engineering or maths discipline this is an ongoing challenge for most countries but with both norway and qatar having small native populations there is a clear requirement to improve the ability to attract talent from overseas provide direct grants for r d with bloom arguing that many research projects have long time horizons and are therefore best suited to government backing as they can take a longer term view both nations have sovereign wealth funds but it was noticeable that norway was primarily investing its windfall overseas in a bid to both keep inflation under control locally and to try and get the best returns in previous research bloom has highlighted how innovation today is getting more expensive so state support is likely to be ever more important in the coming years it is perhaps in the talent side of the equation that both countries struggle with the most there is an overwhelming temptation when developing innovation districts to focus on the built environment and it s hard to escape the huge amount of construction being undertaken in doha streets subways faculties and hospitals are all being built but such infrastructure is not enough to make a community innovative 22 barcelona provides a notable illustration of this as the district which is widely regarded as one of the pioneering developments of its type has many of the hallmarks of innovation districts there is a strong sense that the best ecosystems emerge organically out of existing strengths however not least as research has shown that london s techcity district grew faster before the government decided to back it than afterwards what both barcelona and london enjoy however is an extremely high density of people who are dispersed across clusters of public spaces these are what the world economic forum refers to as the glue of innovation systems as such ecosystems typically thrive because of the dense social interactions and networks that spread across innovative hotspots we literally get smarter by being around other smart people universities research parks and so on can undoubtedly help to promote those connections but so too can bars parks and cafes as such there is much to be said for the deliberate curation of networks to support the kind of social interactions that are so crucial to the innovation process this is especially important in cities like doha and oslo which are beset by not only high costs of living but very lucrative incumbent economies that draw talent to them the right ingredients creating the future getty there is a strong sense that norway is perhaps further along on this journey than qatar and indeed a recent paper from berkeley suggested that growth in the country would have remained strong even without discovering oil in the 1960s the data shows that without oil norway would have developed similarly to western europe the authors say it shows that the real gdp growth for a quarter of a century may have been 1 8 per year without oil compared to 3 3 with oil indeed it s perhaps illustrative to look at the performance of neighbors such as denmark and sweden both of whom sit at the top of imperial college london s recent european index of digital entrepreneurship systems which ranks european nations by virtue of their ability to support startups both sweden and denmark for instance score very highly for the quality of institutions the market conditions for startups and the quality of human capital the success of the nordic nations should perhaps come as no surprise as helsinki was rated the best startup ecosystem in the world in last year s global startup ecosystem report which was compiled based upon data from over 1 million companies spread across nearly 100 cities around the world whilst the u s remains the market leader in terms of share of vc investment there is a clear shift towards europe and asia with china leading the pack clayton christensen famously chronicled the challenges organizations face in diversifying income after achieving success with a particular product or service and the resource curse is that writ large on a national scale qatar and norway are at different stages of their personal battle to move on from the oil bonanza that has so enriched both countries and while it s fair to say that petroleum looms large over both economies there is equally no shortage of effort to encourage fresh industries to emerge time will tell just how effective both prove to be in overcoming the resource curse and ensuring a prosperous future post oil
calgary alberta dec 04 2019 globe newswire commenting on the company s 2020 budget steve laut executive vice chairman of canadian natural stated canadian natural s ability to generate significant and

our large long life low decline asset base effective and efficient operations disciplined capital allocation and a strong balance sheet our 2020 capital budget of 4 05 billion delivers targeted production of approximately 1 172 000 boe d at mid point of guidance resulting in approximately 9 production per share growth in a curtailed environment as we allocate capital to the highest return projects and progress projects that add production and value in 2020 and beyond these targeted 2020 volumes assume that the alberta government curtailment program will continue throughout 2020 and as a result 2020 targeted production is 10 000 bbl d to 25 000 bbl d less than it would have been without the curtailment program we will continue to manage within our curtailment optimization strategy and target to maintain capital flexibility by aligning production growth with improved market access we are hopeful that the curtailment levels will be reduced or eliminated as we progress through 2020 safe reliable and low cost operations continue to be a focus for the company as we capture synergies increase margins and maximize value for our shareholders in 2020 and beyond due to the alberta government s recently announced elimination of curtailment for certain conventional drilling in alberta and its previously announced reduction in income tax rates canadian natural has increased its

137 000 boe d and 1 207 000 boe d with a product mix of approximately 80 crude oil synthetic crude oil sco and ngls and approximately 20 natural gas these targeted 2020 volumes assume that the alberta government curtailment program will continue throughout 2020 and as a result 2020 targeted production is 10 000 bbl d to 25 000 bbl d less than it would have been without the curtailment program overall 2020 crude oil sco and ngl production is targeted to grow approximately 9 from 2019 levels and approximately 13 on a per share basis ranging from 910 000 bbl d to 970 000 bbl d long life low

reaching targeted production capability of 40 000 bbl d in early 2021 at jackfish sagd production from pad additions with targeted production capability of approximately 21 000 bbl d will ramp up within curtailment levels with peak production targeted to be reached in 2022 at the company s oil sands mining upgrading assets canadian natural is targeting continued strong reliability which combined with continuous improvement will drive margin growth in 2020 natural gas production guidance is targeted to range between 1 360 mmcf d to 1 420 mmcf d as the company s natural gas capital

thirteen rounds of negotiations have failed to achieve even a preliminary breakthrough beijing is reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that might satisfy the administration in october the two sides agreed to a modest deal that left the thorniest issues unresolved trump agreed not to proceed with plans to raise tariffs on some chinese goods beijing agreed to buy large quantities of us farm exports but they have failed to finalise that so called phase 1 agreement and on tuesday trump warned that an agreement might not be reached until after the 2020 presidential election metals mayhem last year trump unsheathed a little used weapon in us trade policy section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 to declare foreign steel and aluminum a threat to america s national security using that justification he imposed tariffs of 25 per cent tariff on imported steel and 10 per cent on aluminium but he exempted several countries argentina and brazil for instance avoided the tariffs by agreeing instead to accept quotas on their metal exports to the us with one early morning tweet on monday trump demolished that arrangement he accused argentina and brazil of manipulating their currencies lower in order to give their exporters an unfair price advantage in foreign markets it s true that brazil s real and the argentina s peso have plummeted against the us dollar but it s not because their governments have engaged in currency manipulation rather it s because their economies are in crisis brazil is contending with double digit unemployment and economic stagnation after two years of deep recession argentina is suffering from an economic crisis marked by runaway inflation huge debts and widespread poverty nafta 2 0 trump last year browbeat mexico and canada into agreeing to a rewrite of the north american free trade agreement but his version the us mexico canada agreement or usmca still awaits approval from the us congress having taken effect in 1994 the original nafta erased most trade barriers between the three economies and created a powerful regional trade bloc many us manufacturers moved factories south of the border to capitalise on low wage mexican labour and ship products back to the united states duty free trump and other critics accused nafta of wiping out american manufacturing jobs trump warned that if he couldn t negotiate a better deal he d kill nafta altogether usmca emerged after more than a year of contentious negotiations the revamped deal is meant to return some factories and factory jobs to the united states among other things it requires that 40 per cent to 45 per cent of autos must be built where auto workers earn at least us 16 an hour in order to qualify for the trade deal s duty free status but house democrats who must approve usmca insist that trump s version needs to be tweaked to ensure that it can be enforced they ve been negotiating changes with trump s top trade official robert lighthizer but have yet to resolve their differences france s tech tax the administration on monday announced plans to impose tariffs of up to 100 per cent on cheese wine lipstick and other french imports collectively worth us 2 4 billion the reason france last summer passed a digital services tax that targets american tech giants such as amazon and google the french tax is designed to prevent tech companies from dodging taxes by establishing their headquarters in low tax european union countries it imposes a 3 per cent annual levy on french revenue of digital companies with yearly global sales worth more than 750 million s 1 1 billion and french revenue exceeding 25 million the trump administration has also criticised the french tax for targeting companies revenue not their profits and for being retroactive french president emmanuel macron has threatened a robust response from europe if the us proceeds with the tariffs taxing foreign cars at trump s request the commerce department launched an investigation into auto imports and then dutifully declared that they too posed a threat to america s national security that could clear the way for trump to impose tariffs on foreign vehicles and auto parts auto tariffs would mark a major escalation in trump s protectionist policies the united states last year imported us 192 billion worth of passenger vehicles and us 159 billion in auto parts virtually no one outside the white house supports the tariffs imposing them would widen a rift with europe and risk a backlash in congress where lawmakers are already considering scaling back the president s power to impose tariffs on national security grounds trump has sought to use the tariff threat to wring trade concessions out of japan and the european union prime minister shinzo abe has said that trump vowed to forgo tariffs on japan s cars as part of a mini trade deal the two countries reached earlier this year in may trump delayed the tariffs for six months while continuing negotiations with japan and the eu as mid november approached trump said he d decide on the tariffs very soon but the deadline came and went with no comment from the administration

worryingly this lending has been facilitated by the securitization of highly leveraged loans through collaterized loan obligations clos these instruments are analogous to the synthetic assets based on pools of mortgages that fuelled the pre crisis housing boom and which did such lasting damage when they began to implode in 2007 for the avoidance of doubt clos are not the same instruments and likely do not pose the same risks to the financial system however they have enabled some firms to take on high debt burdens making them vulnerable to weaker earnings or higher interest rates asset management companies and the electronic herd a large share of clos can be found in the portfolios of us asset management companies which have grown considerably over the past decade since these firms are capitalized by those investing with them in theory asset management companies should not pose a significant threat to financial stability at the same time the rapid growth of assets under administration could be a source of market volatility if asset managers investment decisions are highly correlated a few firms making synchronous decisions to reduce holdings for example could generate large price movements that have knock on effects throughout the financial system high volatility could trigger trading algorithms that magnify price movements in a panicked electronic herd effect a term coined by thomas friedman that inadvertently produces asset fire sales and systemic risk as investors simultaneously sell assets in a panicked rush to liquidity the unintended effects of liquidity regulation the possibility of market volatility underscores the importance of ensuring the efficient allocation of liquidity across the financial system post crisis reforms have increased liquidity buffers on large banks making them less vulnerable to the kinds of asset fire sales that did so much damage a decade ago but concerns have been raised that these reforms could exacerbate problems of illiquidity in the event of severe disruption such reforms could incentivize banks to hoard liquid assets when such assets are most needed to limit the propagation and transmission of liquidity shocks while the disruption in us money markets in september which caused short term interest rates to briefly spike may be unrelated to the possible effects of regulation it underscores the need to carefully monitor market liquidity for signs of possible dysfunction monetary policy at the zero lower bound all these risks point to the need for vigilance by central banks around the world in this respect another risk gaining prominence is the worrying possibility that central banks operating at or close to the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates may be less capable of supporting growth in the face of a negative shock to output the so called lower bound arises because once interest rates are at zero it is unclear that traditional monetary policy can force interest rates below zero as a result while there is no limit to the extent to which central banks can raise interest rates to contain inflationary pressures they are limited in the extent to which they can provide the necessary monetary stimulus should growth falter

trump says trade deal could come after 2020 election stoxx 600 reverses gains now down 0 6 wall street futures plunge luxury stocks hit by us tariff threats welcome to the home for real time coverage of european equity markets brought to you by reuters stocks reporters and anchored today by julien ponthus reach him on messenger to share your thoughts on market moves julien ponthus thomsonreuters com reuters net ez banks tfw even an outrageous prediction won t help much 1429 gmt the eurostoxx bank index recovering 30 to mid 2018 levels is among saxo bank s 10 outrageous predictions for 2020 the possibility of christine lagarde turning hawkish and reversing monetary policy in january is about as likely as johnson embracing mmt and spending so much money that the uk grows faster than china in other words pigs will fly saxo bank publishes its annual outrageous predictions as an imaginative pr exercise justified on the hard to argue with grounds that the most disruptive events are those which no one sees coming christopher dembik head of macro analysis made the tongue in cheek prediction that eu banks will be among the best performing sectors in 2020 with the eurostoxx index boosted by 30 thanks to lagarde bringing rates back into positive territory before the end of the next year but the fact that such a share price boost would be considered outrageous only highlights what dire straits shares in the banking sector are in the index is currently at about 91 points to put things into context it was at flirting with 500 points before the financial crisis hit and hovering around 160 for the most part of 2015 whether or not the other predictions are outrageous is for you to decide in politics the status quo would be disrupted by the sudden failure of populism replaced by commitments to heal instead of divide according to saxo bank s chief economist steen jakobsen it s perhaps noteworthy that saxo bank sees the possibility of oil and gas industries winning in 2020 to the detriment of clean energy investments and indeed the planet as a prediction unlikely enough to be listed alongside uk growth doubling to 8 the ecb admitting monetary policy has reached its limits or hungary leaving the eu other unusual suggestions for the year ahead include trump introducing an america first tax of 25 on all u s revenues sourced from foreign production if he does you ll have to blame john hardy head of fx strategy for giving him the idea kay van petersen saxo s global macro strategist meanwhile suggested that the asian infrastructure investment bank could create a new reserve asset worth 2 thus challenging the dollar s status as the world s reserve currency elizabeth howcroft uk stocks still unloved 1201 gmt uk stocks stand out pretty much as cheap and unloved but since the risk of a no deal brexit is now reduced after boris johnson secured a deal in brussels and the general election is scheduled is it time for investors to show some love to uk listed companies fidelity thinks so as we head into 2020 the unloved status of the uk market provides a plentiful opportunity set alex wright portfolio manager at fidelity special situations and fidelity special values says in a today s note it is true that fundamentals are not great in the uk but neither are they in many other parts of the world importantly what the uk has which other markets do not is a low starting valuation wright he offers a few tips on how to navigate the uk stocks dig into selective opportunities in financials and consumer businesses tread cautiously among domestic shares as some business have structural issues and they could be value traps watch out for retailers which are particularly exposed to sterling weakness as they buy their goods overseas to sell in the u k stay defensive the portfolio today has a more defensive tilt than at any time over my tenure wright adds joice alves tariffs tit for tat luxury brands are the french faangs 1114 gmt is washington s threat to slap hefty tariffs on french luxury goods a perfect tit for tat looks like it is luxury stocks such as lvmh kering and hermes are all down 1 3 to 2 this morning after the u s govt threatened 100 tariffs on 2 4 billion of imports from france in reply to paris digital services tax that would hit the likes of google or facebook the french luxury groups are to local investors what the amazon or apple are to wall street in a word they are the faangs of european equities as they are the key drivers of growth in their respective indexes see chart below in fact some of them have done better than the faangs in the last five years jonathan bell chief investment officer at stanhope capital has lvmh on his buy list because of its success in managing and growing expensive brands which makes it an equivalent to the faang stocks and unlikely to be damaged by tariffs in the short term it could easily be hit by these sorts of concerns but these things can turn around very quickly and in the long run i think most of the owners of lvmh are people that a bit like warren buffet in coca cola they buy it and own it for the long term bell said for lvmh the threat of tariffs is likely to be a short term issue which may dent them for a quarter s earnings but probably not longer than that the bigger trends would be if consumers in china suddenly decided that they didn t want to buy goods that they consider to be french that sort of thing would have a much bigger impact than this he said clairinvest fund manager ion marc valahu on the other hand struck a more cautious note it s too risky to go into the luxury sector the sector was hit first of all by the hong kong protests and now this will hit it even more elizabeth howcroft cineworld bad previews but a hit among traders 1052 gmt if there s a silverlining to be found in this morning price action on cineworld is that you should never let bad previews prevent you from going to see a movie you fancy pre market indications we saw 6 of them for the stock were pointing out to a fall of between 1 and 5 at the open after the company warned its full year earnings would be below forecast we would expect focus on the box office underperformance and weaker fy expectations which may see the shares lower today ubs analysts wrote before the bell so at first it did look like the expected flop but then this happened a 10 comeback within 40 minutes why that s obviously the question on everybody s mind particularly those who got burnt on the basis of the pre market indications a rise in cineworld s share price on today s news is probably down to short sellers closing out their positions now we ve had confirmation of weaker trading wrote russ mould investment director at aj bell another view from cmc market s michael hewson is that frozen 2 a thanksgiving hit and the imminent release of the latest star wars could well pick up the slack in the next few weeks writing after the dust had settled the share centre took the view that the company s fundamentals don t actually look bad even if its debt pile could be seen as spooky for cautious investors with more potential benefits from regal their multi billion u s acquisition to come and a good dividend yield in place we retain our buy recommendation for investors willing to accept a higher level of risk julien ponthus another 12 months of trade pain 1037 gmt once again a bright morning for markets gets clouded by trump s comments on global trade and this time it s on the u s china trade what were the odds of a no trade deal for another twelve months until this morning very low but that s changed after this comment from trump i have no deadline no in some ways i think i think it s better to wait until after the election with china the bounce back we saw this morning quickly disappeared after trump s comment and december turns out to be a disaster so far for stock markets thyagaraju adinarayan no santa claus rally again 0918 gmt it took just a couple of tweets to bring the pre christmas rally down to a screeching halt trump s tweet on reinstating tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from argentina and brazil triggered the downfall in the last 24 hours we ve gone from a potential santa claus rally to a more scrooge like environment as the ghost of trade wars past came back to haunt the market deutsche bank s jim reid says to make things worse washington threatened to slap 100 duties on french goods such as champagne or handbags that clearly is visible in cac 40 s underperformance today speaking of a santa claus rally in the last 5 years we ve had only two positive decembers see seasonality chart below last year was one of the thyagaraju adinarayan opening snapshot keep calm and carry on 0832 gmt one thing is for sure there is no hysteria on european trading floors over the trade war s latest developments the dax the typical barometer on the issue is up 0 7 in a nutshell the bulk of the trade war losses were made yesterday traders aren t taking positions indiscriminately selling is clearly targeted at those companies who could suffer from the trump s administration desire to punish france for its new digital services tax aimed at u s tech companies so logically on paris cac 40 hermes lvmh and kering are leading the losers funny to note that france s luxury groups the likely target of u s tariffs are a bit to the french stock market what the fangs are to wall street both sectors are key to local investors and are used as proxies in the trade war the only other sectors feeling the heat this morning from the trade war are basic materials with the sector down 0 8 this in turn is weighing on the ftse 100 and its big mining groups julien ponthus on the radar champagne handbags and spoils of trade war 0747 gmt with new fronts in brazil argentina europe and france the trade war is likely to be the key driver for this session especially with trump in the uk for the nato summit after the u s threatened to slap punitive duties of up to 100 on 2 4 billion of imports from france on products such as champagne or handbags french companies such as lvmh kering and laurent perrier will be closely watched not to say that the war or words could weigh generally on the cac 40 with junior economy minister agnes pannier runacher promising france will be pugnacious european stocks could also suffer as a whole after the u s said it may set retaliatory tariffs on a wide range of european goods after the wto rejected eu airbus subsidies claims in terms of individual stocks italy s biggest bank unicredit will be under the spotlight after it said it would shed 8 000 jobs to reduce costs by 1 billion euros in western europe under a new plan to 2023 still in italy enel joined a race with at least five other bidders to buy

many reasons out there for european shares to rise at the open after wall street and asian stock market fell due to trump s surprise tariffs announcements one reason though is that after falling 1 6 on monday the worst single day drop in two months there s probably room for the stoxx 600 to enjoy some kind of technical rebound according to cmc markets london s ftse 100 is expected to open 14

president donald trump slapped new tariffs on brazil and argentina after accusing them of manipulating their currencies to boost exports it wasn t the first time trump has labeled another country a currency manipulator for supposedly meddling to keep its own currency weak or undervalued china received that epithet from the president long before it felt the pain of his trade war but the truth is more complicated than trump makes it out to be everyone does it the first thing to understand is that government efforts to influence their exchange rates which is often dubbed currency manipulation is extremely common as i ve seen firsthand in my work as an international business professor all but 31 of the international monetary fund s 189 members meddle in a mild or total fashion to influence or fix their exchange rates only a few major currencies such as the dollar or euro are allowed a free float based on market forces of supply and demand with minimal or no government intervention other governments have a variety of ways to manage their currencies some peg their currencies to a fixed rate as long as they can afford to keep it there others tie their currencies to a major but stable currency like the euro or a basket of different ones for example the lebanese pound is tied to the dollar at a fixed rate of 1 507 5 to 1 about 16 of imf members use a managed float in which they allow market forces to play a role but with the government buying or selling their own currency as needed to bias the exchange rate upward or downward argentina and brazil both adhere to a managed float system why weaken a currency generally when the trump administration has criticized countries the allegation is that their government is keeping its currency undervalued in order to give an artificial boost to exports while making it harder for imports to compete a weaker currency makes the products it sells abroad cheaper while making imports more expensive for its consumers this may have the effect of boosting jobs in that country trump believes this is what brazil and argentina are doing economists say the two countries are actually trying to prevent their currencies from weakening against the dollar that s in part because a weak currency also makes imports more expensive for businesses that rely on foreign inputs to make their products so higher import costs along with persistently high inflation in both argentina and brazil largely offset any gains from their weaker currencies the strong dollar but more importantly these currencies seem undervalued primarily because the u s dollar is unnaturally strong one reason for the strength of the dollar is that inflation adjusted interest rates in the u s are still relatively high another is that the dollar is still a haven making it an attractive place to park your cash during global economic uncertainty as a result a massive amount of foreign money has flowed into dollar denominated bank deposits treasury bonds u s stocks and real estate over the past few years and the reality is that the dollar is now exceptionally strong not that other currencies are weak or necessarily being manipulated ultimately labeling other countries as currency manipulators is more about politics and geopolitical relations than policy this is an updated version of an article originally published on july 13 2016 farok j contractor distinguished professor of management global business rutgers university this article is republished from the conversation under a creative commons license read the original article

which stated that the outlook for the global economy was reasonable but the risks tilted to the downside according to the statement published by rba the interest rates would remain low for an extended period of time rba sees its inflation level close to 2 in 2020 and 2021 and is prepared to ease its monetary policy further if needed according to the statement the weak household income growth has weighed on spending and a lower cash rate has put downward pressure on aussie it is also expected that unemployment in australia would fall below 5 in the upcoming years the statement released on tuesday was a little more constructive than in november rba repeated in its report that the economy of australia has reached its turning point but uncertainty on the outlook for consumption was still

o ver a decade before thousands of protesters gathered in zuccotti park in new york in 2011 a little known researcher in france sat down to write about income inequality in a new way the focus of our study consists in comparing the evolution of the incomes of the top 10 the top 1 the top 0 5 and so on thomas piketty wrote in a paper in 1998 with his long term co author emmanuel saez mr piketty pioneered the use of tax data over survey data thereby doing a better job of capturing the incomes of the richest he revealed that the 1 had made out like bandits at the expense of the 99 his research gave occupy wall street its vocabulary listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element what followed was an explosion of research into the causes and consequences of a surge in inequality across the rich world in capital in the twenty first century a bestseller first published in 2013 mr piketty argued that under capitalism rising inequality was the normal state of affairs mr piketty s research and more like it became part of the political discourse in america and much of the west two leading candidates for the democratic nomination for the american presidency elizabeth warren and bernie sanders have proposed taxes on wealth to tackle inequality pledges cheered on by mr saez and mr piketty s other co author gabriel zucman in a new book capital and ideology currently available only in french mr piketty calls for a 90 tax on wealth such is the scale of the inequality crisis many things have indeed gone wrong with contemporary capitalism in many countries social mobility is falling too many companies enjoy excessive market power and housing is too pricey all these factors and more also help explain why economic growth in the rich world is weak yet just as ideas about inequality have completed their march from the academy to the frontlines of politics researchers have begun to look again and some are wondering whether inequality has in fact risen as much as claimed or by some measures at all it is fiendishly complicated to calculate how much people earn in a year or the value of the assets under their control and thus a country s level of income or wealth inequality some people fail to complete government surveys others undercount income on their tax returns and defining what counts as income is surprisingly difficult as is valuing assets such as unquoted shares or artwork legions of academics not to mention government officials and researchers in think tanks are devoted to unpicking these problems money it s a gas the conventional wisdom to have emerged from these efforts revolves around four main points first over a period of four to five decades the incomes of the top 1 have soared second the incomes of middle earners have stagnated third wages have barely risen even though productivity has done so meaning that an increasing share of gdp has gone to investors in the form of interest dividends and capital gains rather than to labour in the form of wages fourth the rich have reinvested the fruits of their success such that inequality of wealth ie the stock of assets less liabilities such as mortgage debt has risen too each argument has always had its doubters but they have grown in number as a series of new papers have called the existing estimates of inequality into question start with top incomes the idea that they have surged has always been shaky outside america in britain the share of after tax income of the top 1 is no higher than it was in the mid 1990s across europe the ratio of the post tax income of the top 10 to that of the bottom 50 has changed remarkably little since the mid 1990s according to thomas blanchet of the paris school of economics and his colleagues in america the story seemed more solid based on the analyses of tax data produced by the likes of messrs piketty saez and zucman however a recent working paper by gerald auten and david splinter economists at the treasury and congress s joint committee on taxation respectively reaches a striking new conclusion it finds that after adjusting for taxes and transfers the income share of america s top 1 has barely changed since the 1960s see chart 1 they are not the first to have adjusted for taxes and transfers america s congressional budget office cbo does the same its statistics show that top incomes rose a lot in the 1980s and 1990s typically after tax and transfer figures are greatly affected by the growing provision of means tested health insurance in 1997 the children s health insurance programme chip expanded federal funding for health insurance for many youngsters in 2014 barack obama s health care reform expanded eligibility for medicaid a health insurance programme for the poor in most states according to the cbo s data medicaid and chip account for over 80 of the growth in real terms means tested transfers to poor households between 1979 and 2016 messrs auten and splinter s innovation is to correct step by step for what they say are a series of errors in the most famous existing inequality estimates for instance they change how people are ranked messrs piketty and saez s most influential paper from 2003 was concerned with the top 1 of tax units typically meaning households who file their taxes on a single return but this introduces a bias marriage rates have declined disproportionately among poorer americans that increases top income shares by spreading the incomes of poorer workers over more households even as the incomes of the top 1 of households remain pooled messrs auten and splinter therefore rank individuals another correction concerns the tax reforms passed under ronald reagan in 1986 apparent changes in top incomes around this reform account for about two fifths of the total increase between 1962 and 2015 in the pre tax incomes of the top 1 in messrs piketty and saez s estimates messrs auten and splinter say this is an illusion reagan s tax reform created strong incentives for firms to operate as pass through entities where owners register profits as income on their tax returns rather than sheltering this income inside corporations since these incentives did not exist before then top income shares before 1987 are liable to be understated money inside corporations does eventually show up in messrs piketty and saez s numbers but possibly in the wrong years as firms retain earnings ie do not pay out their profits as dividends they become more valuable when shares in those businesses subsequently change hands the sellers must therefore report capital gains on their tax returns something messrs piketty and saez keep track of but capital gains also reflect the chosen timing of the seller and movements in the stockmarket making them volatile for these reasons messrs auten and splinter ignore capital gains and instead count corporations retained earnings from year to year they allocate those earnings to individuals both before and after the 1986 tax reform in proportion to their share holdings and whereas taxable capital gains are concentrated among the rich workers own lots of shares through their tax free retirement accounts new methodology introduced by messrs piketty saez and zucman in a paper last year ranks by individuals and replaces capital gains with retained corporate earnings but it still finds the share of pre tax income of the top 1 to have surged from about 12 in the early 1980s to 20 in 2014 that is because they count a wide array of new income sources the new methodology tries to trace and allocate every dollar of gd p in order to produce distributional national accounts a project that mr zucman hopes will eventually be taken over by government statisticians it is a tricky exercise because two fifths of gd p does not show up on individuals tax returns it is either deliberately left untaxed by government or illegally omitted from tax returns by those who file them allocating this missing gdp to individuals is as much art as it is science which is why messrs piketty and saez s original more conservative method remains influential how to do it properly is the source of the most important disagreement between the two groups of economists one chunk of missing gdp is found in the pension system as retirement savings grow often inside tax free accounts broadly both sets of economists agree that this income should be allocated to individuals in proportion to the size of their pension savings but the distribution of those savings must itself be estimated messrs auten and splinter say that while attempting this messrs piketty saez and zucman mishandle the data their alleged error is to identify some flows as retirement income when in fact they are existing savings being shifted or rolled over in the jargon between pension accounts mr zucman told the economist that this error does not in fact exist and that he disagrees with all of messrs auten and splinter s adjustments to his work grab that cash with both hands another chunk of gdp goes missing because of tax evasion but the two sets of economists disagree about the identity of the perpetrators messrs auten and splinter rely on the leading study of tax evasion which was written by andrew johns of the internal revenue service irs and joel slemrod of the university of michigan in 2010 it uses the results of audits from the irs to estimate tax evasion by income group at first messrs piketty saez and zucman alleged that these figures understate tax evasion by the rich which they say is too sophisticated for irs audits to catch more recently they have written that it is in fact their methods that are most consistent with messrs johns and slemrod s work other economists are generally unwilling to wade in to say who is right most just point out that allocating missing income is tricky mr slemrod says he has not yet studied the disagreement in line with the prevailing theories on inequality messrs auten and splinter ultimately find that the top 1 share of pre tax income has risen since the 1960s though by less than other estimates but it is inequality in incomes after taxes and benefits that really conveys differences in living standards and in which messrs auten and splinter find little change some economists argue these figures are distorted by the inclusion of medicaid but it is hard to deny that the provision of free health care reduces inequality the question is whether non cash benefits should properly count as income money it s a hit many of these debates also spill over into criticism of the second part of the conventional wisdom on inequality that middle incomes have stagnated messrs piketty saez and zucman argue that the rising share of the top 1 of earners has come at the expense of the bottom 50 it follows that if the top 1 have not done as well someone else must have done better sure enough just as a wide range of estimates of inequality exist so too is there an enormous variation in estimates of the long term growth of middle incomes a literature review by stephen rose of the urban institute a think tank describes six possible figures for american real median income growth between 1979 and 2014 ranging from a fall of 8 using messrs piketty and saez s methodology from 2003 to an increase of 51 using the cbo s the third part of the conventional thinking on inequality that productivity growth has outstripped incomes was a central thesis of mr piketty s bestseller indeed it gave the book its title he argued that at the top of the income distribution a new rentier class was emerging which made most of its money from investing or inheriting rather than working that has seemed consistent with data across the rich world showing a rising share of gdp going to capital rather than to workers but those data are also coming under increasing scrutiny not long after the publication of capital in the twenty first century matthew rognlie now of northwestern university argued that the rise in america s capital share was accounted for by growing returns to housing not by the shares and bonds which are held disproportionately by the top 1 of american households in another paper published in february another group of economists examine sources of income among the top 1 of american earners much of their income comes from pass through businesses whose profits are easily mistaken for income from investments but the authors matthew smith of the treasury danny yagan of the university of california berkeley owen zidar of princeton and eric zwick of the university of chicago find that the profits of pass through firms fall by three quarters after their owners retire or die suggesting that most of the earnings depend on labour many doctors lawyers and consultants run pass through firms people who should probably be considered self employed including their income in the capital share overstates its rise lately economists have broadened these criticisms internationally in a recent working paper gilbert cette of the bank of france thomas philippon of new york university nyu and lorraine koehl of insee in france adjust for distortions in the data caused by self employment and property income they find that the labour share has declined in america since 2000 but that there has been no generalised decline among advanced economies another working paper by germán gutiérrez of nyu and sophie piton of the bank of england finds the same thing see chart 2 the final and fourth part of the conventional wisdom to come under attack concerns wealth inequality which has long been the most difficult type of inequality to judge measures of inequality of any kind tend to suffer from the fact that they do not track individuals but slices of the population which are made up of different people at different points in time for individuals a good predictor of high income growth in future is being poor and vice versa owing to the statistical phenomenon known as reversion to the mean for example a study from 2013 by mr auten and his treasury colleagues geoffrey gee and nicholas turner tracked the incomes of individuals who were aged 35 40 in 1987 over two decades median earners in the lowest quintile in 1987 saw their real income grow by 100 over that period while median earners in the top quintile suffered a 5 fall of earners in the top 1 in 2002 fewer than half were in the top 1 five years later according to research by thomas hirschl at cornell university 11 of americans will join the top 1 for at least one year between the ages of 25 and 60 keep your hands off my stack with wealth inequality this compositional problem is turned up a notch wealth is accumulated as people save for retirement that means it tends to increase with age especially during careers and many people can therefore expect to appear relatively wealthy on a population wide measure at some point in their life moreover the need for poorer individuals to save and accumulate wealth may be lessened by the provision of pensions or public services that helps explain the puzzle of why socially democratic sweden appears to have extremely high wealth inequality and why hardly anyone there seems bothered by it see article a paper by messrs saez and zucman published in 2016 finds that the wealth share of the top 0 1 of american households rose from 7 in 1978 to 22 in 2012 which is almost as high as it was in 1929 messrs saez and zucman have used their estimates of wealth at the top to project how much revenue the annual wealth taxes proposed by ms warren and mr sanders would generate ms warren s wealth tax originally kicked in on fortunes in excess of 50m and reached 3 on the wealthiest households generating annual revenue worth 1 of gdp they said ms warren has since doubled the top rate that estimate has attracted substantial criticism messrs saez and zucman s paper has come under scrutiny too their wealth estimates are reached in part by studying investment income on tax returns within a given category of income such as equities or fixed income investments like bonds they assume an average rate of return and use it to impute individuals wealth for example were the assumed return on an investment 5 income would be multiplied by 20 to come to an estimate of the investment s size in a working paper messrs smith zidar and zwick expand on this methodology but they allow for more variation in the assumed rates of return in particular they cite survey data showing that the returns earned on fixed income investments differ substantially for example the bottom 99 say they hold nearly 70 of their fixed income wealth in bank deposits which tend to pay little interest but the figure for the top 0 1 is no more than one fifth those with the most fixed income wealth are more likely to hold corporate bonds which because they are riskier bring higher returns a higher yield means researchers need to use a smaller number to multiply up to estimate wealth when interest rates are low as they have been in recent years this can make a big difference a return assumption of 1 for example generates an estimate of wealth that is only half as large as a return assumption of 0 5 whereas a difference between 4 5 and 5 would matter much less making this change and also some other adjustments such as to account properly for pass through businesses messrs smith zidar and zwick construct a new ranking of households by wealth in which the share of the top 0 1 is only 15 more significantly they find that the rise in top wealth shares since 1980 falls by half messrs saez and zucman dispute their assumptions but at the very least the debate shows how tricky it is to estimate wealth and how sensitive estimates are to changes in assumptions about uncertain factors and that makes the revenue that any wealth tax would raise equally uncertain few dispute that wealth shares at the top have risen in america nor that the increase is driven by fortunes at the very top among people who really can be considered an elite the question instead is by just how much don t take a slice of my pie internationally the picture is murkier according to daniel waldenström of the research institute of industrial economics in stockholm good data on the distribution of wealth exist for only three countries beside america britain denmark and france in these places it is difficult to discern any clear trends in inequality over the past few decades see chart 3 one study from katrine jakobsen of the university of copenhagen and co authors including mr zucman finds that the wealth share of the top 1 in denmark rose in the 1980s but has remained fairly constant since then in france whether or not wealth inequality appears to be rising depends on whether you track capital income or inheritances says mr waldenström
the international monetary fund imf has changed gone are the days when it would use its lending powers to strong arm countries into adopting a slate of free market reforms that put the interests of investors before those of the people or so it claims the imf truly has progressed since the heyday of the washington consensus in the 1990s combatting inequality has been incorporated into its mandate and is now one of its own criteria for success at least nominally capital controls previously frowned upon by many mainstream economists as an impediment to globalization are now recognized as a potentially useful tool for developing countries and concerted if inconsistent efforts have been made to reduce the burden of conditions attached to imf loans these are real improvements and commendations are due to those inside and outside the organization who fought for them but beneath these much publicized reforms the fundamental structure of the imf s approach remains the same today as before the organization privileges the interests of businesses and investors over the needs of the people it purports to help nowhere is this clearer than in ecuador where president lenin moreno s implementation of a 4 2 billion imf loan agreement sparked a wave of mass protests led by a coalition of students workers and indigenous groups flexibilization moreno came to power in 2017 after the left leaning former president rafael correa s occasionally deficient but generally successful decade in office from 2006 to 2016 per capita gdp growth rates more than doubled on average and inequality fell considerably the percentage of people living in extreme poverty defined as those earning roughly 48 per month or less in today s dollars was cut almost by half in part due to significant increases in social spending on health education and housing much of these gains were enabled by an extractive development model and windfall from high international oil prices but when those prices plummeted in 2014 correa s administration weathered the storm better than many other oil exporting countries in some measure due to ecuador s intentional default on 3 2 billion of historical debt that correa criticized as illegitimate after winning an election campaign during which he promised to continue correa s policies moreno unexpectedly broke from his predecessor and shifted the country sharply rightward the imf agreement signed in march solidified this shift and reveals how little the imf has really changed first and foremost the agreement is a classic austerity package mandating dramatic cuts in public spending on the order of 6 of gdp over three years mark weisbrot co director of the washington based center for economic and policy research estimates that this budget tightening will entail firing tens of thousands of public sector employees raising taxes that fall disproportionately on poor people and making cuts to public investment this in turn will lead to higher unemployment an increase in poverty and an economic downturn that will be longer and deeper than even the imf s own projected recession the country s current unrest was sparked by one piece of this austerity program a sudden and significant cut to fuel subsidies second the agreement calls for the suppression of labor rights in addition to the firing of public workers the imf package mandates reduced public sector benefits and a decrease in the public sector minimum wage the agreement s flexibilization reforms which apply to the private sector as well include looser restrictions on worker dismissals weaker regulations on hours and overtime pay and fewer protections for contracted workers third the agreement pushes for a reduction in capital controls in doing so it contravenes even the imf s own supposed evolution on the topic and makes ecuador susceptible to the same volatile hot money flows that resulted in numerous catastrophic financial crises during the 1990s the agreement also makes ecuador s tax system more regressive moves toward the privatization of publicly owned enterprises like airlines and utilities and undermines ecuador s state led development model by weakening the role of the development planning ministry in the budget process beyond its specific provisions the agreement as a whole has been criticized by ecuadorian civil society groups for what they claim to be an unconstitutional circumventing of the legislature imf equals hunger ecuador is not alone egypt under the authoritarian us backed hand of abdel fattah el sisi recently implemented austerity policies mandated by the imf that have led to rising poverty deepening inequality and the slashing of social benefits in 2018 the prime minister of jordan was forced to resign following mass protests against a similar imf program and in argentina anti austerity demonstrators have adopted the potent slogan of fmi hambre imf equals hunger austerity suppression of labor capital liberalization regressive taxation privatization by passing of the democratically elected representatives of the people and the use of state force to suppress resistance to those who endured the imf programs of the 1980s and 90s this all surely sounds familiar fortunately this may not be ecuador s future after weeks of unrest moreno was recently forced to concede promising to cancel at least part of the package and work with indigenous leaders on a negotiated alternative whether this promise is kept and what the compromise looks like remain to be seen for now though the people have fought back and won but their very need to do so exposes how little the imf has changed the imf s agreement with ecuador would likely have been even worse a few decades prior but to those forced to suffer under austerity today that is likely cold comfort the views expressed in this article are the author s own and do not necessarily reflect fair observer s editorial policy
demand for our services continued to grow in all of our regions this quarter driven primarily by market share growth as customers value our specialized expertise and safety culture said denis larocque president and ceo of major drilling group international inc we had a very good operational quarter all around which has allowed us to produce good margins margins were also strengthened by a one time revenue adjustment from escalation and currency clauses on one of our contracts moncton new brunswick dec 04 2019 globe newswire major drilling group international inc tsx mdi today reported results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2020 ended october 31 2019 the company s ebitda increased by 30 with a 15 revenue growth demonstrating the company s operational leverage we continue to reap productivity benefits from the tools we ve developed over the last few years and from our enhanced training and skilled labour force also our administrative costs remained relatively stable despite the revenue growth the company improved its net cash position by 12 8 million to 22 5 million this quarter we spent 5 5 million on capital expenditures adding one new rig to our fleet as well as rod handlers and support equipment and disposed of one rig in line with our strategy of improving our fleet and services the fleet total remains unchanged at 601 rigs added mr larocque we are continuing to improve the suite of services we offer our customers with new innovative solutions and improved equipment through increased hands free rod handling capacity computerized rigs and deep hole capacity we have established mutually beneficial partnerships with several of our senior customers to develop these innovative solutions it is important to note that we are now in our third quarter traditionally the weakest quarter of our fiscal year as mining and exploration companies shut down often for extended periods over the holiday season as usual due to the time it takes to mobilize once new contracts are awarded a slow start up pace is expected in january and february additionally the company schedules substantial overhaul and maintenance work on its equipment during this slower period these factors result in reduced revenue increased costs and reduced margins in the third quarter said mr larocque following the end of the second quarter on november 1st the company closed a transaction to acquire the shares of norex drilling limited the transaction was completed by payment of a cash portion of 15 2 million subject to post closing debt working capital adjustments and holdbacks out of the company s current cash balance and the issuance of 334 169 common shares of the company in addition an earn out of up to 2 5 million will be payable in cash following the third anniversary of the closing subject to certain conditions looking forward to the fourth quarter and beyond senior customers are still working through their budget process and have yet to decide on post holiday exploration plans the price of gold which historically has accounted for approximately 50 of the company s drilling activity has remained above us 1 400 an ounce over the last four months which has produced some good cash flow generation and improved balance sheets for our senior gold customers although exploration expenditures are down globally in calendar 2019 we have increased our revenue with senior mining companies by 24 as we continue to build our relationships with these customers as activity increases we expect to face labour and materials cost inflation we are in a position to react quickly to customers demands as the company s financial strength has allowed it to invest in safety equipment innovation and to maintain its equipment in excellent condition finally i am pleased to announce that ms sybil veenman has been appointed to the company s board of directors ms veenman brings over 20 years of mining industry experience both as a public company director and a senior executive previously she was senior vice president and general counsel and a member of the executive leadership team at barrick gold corporation she currently serves as a director at royal gold inc iamgold nexgen energy ltd and noront resources ltd second quarter ended october 31 2019 total revenue for the quarter was 121 2 million up 15 from revenue of 105 5 million recorded in the same quarter last year the favourable foreign exchange translation impact for the quarter when comparing to the effective rates for the same period last year is estimated at 1 million on revenue with a negligible impact on net earnings revenue for the quarter from canada u s drilling operations increased by 16 to 65 3 million compared to the same period last year with both regions demonstrating growth our u s operations experienced another strong quarter of revenue growth due to increased market share with senior customers south and central american revenue increased by 2 to 29 8 million for the quarter compared to the same quarter last year a strong quarter in mexico and brazil was offset by a continued slowdown in argentina due to political uncertainty as well as business interruptions in chile and suriname due to unforeseen political and civil unrest asian and african operations reported revenue of 26 1 million up 32 from the same period last year indonesia and southern africa continued their recent growth trends which more than offset the loss of revenue from closing our burkina faso operations in the previous year the overall gross margin percentage for the quarter was 28 1 compared to 27 4 for the same period last year a good operational quarter somewhat strengthened by a one time revenue adjustment from escalation and currency clauses on one of our contracts contributed to the margin growth general and administrative costs were 11 5 million an increase of 0 3 million compared to the same quarter last year the marginal increase was mainly driven by our share based compensation plan that was impacted by the positive upward movement of the share price over the quarter offset by the impact of ifrs 16 net earnings were 7 3 million or 0 09 per

appropriate intra group transactions balances income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation where appropriate basis of preparation these interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared based on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value using the same accounting policies and methods of computation as presented in the company s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended april 30 2019 except as described in note 3 3 adoption of new ifrs the company adopted ifrs 16 leases ifrs 16 which replaces ias 17 leases for its annual period beginning may 1 2019 using the modified retrospective approach whereby no restatement of comparative periods is required under ias 17 leases of property plant and equipment were recognized as finance leases when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying assets were transferred all other leases were classified as operating leases ifrs 16 requires lessees to recognize right of use assets representing its right to use the underlying asset and lease liabilities representing its obligation to make payments right of use assets are measured at cost comprised of the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liabilities lease payments made on or before the commencement date and any initial direct costs they are subsequently depreciated on a straight line basis and reduced by impairment losses if any right of use assets may also be adjusted to reflect the re measurement of related lease liabilities lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or if that rate cannot be readily determined the company s incremental borrowing rate subsequently the lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method and adjusted for interest and lease payments on transition the company recognized lease liabilities and right of use assets for 14 leases previously classified as operating leases in the amount of 2 903 as permitted by ifrs 16 the company elected not to recognize lease liabilities and right of use assets for short term leases lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low value assets there were no onerous lease contracts that would have required an adjustment to the right

uncertainty and critical accounting judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with international financial reporting standards ifrs requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that are not readily apparent from other sources which affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets liabilities income and expenses actual results may differ from these estimates the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods significant areas requiring the use of management estimates relate to the useful lives of property plant and equipment for depreciation purposes property plant and equipment and inventory valuation determination of income and other taxes assumptions used in the compilation of share based payments fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business acquisitions amounts recorded as accrued liabilities and allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment testing of goodwill the company applied judgment in determining the functional currency of the company and its subsidiaries the determination of cash generating units cgus the degree of componentization of property plant and equipment the recognition of provisions and accrued liabilities and the determination of the probability that deferred income tax assets will be realized from future taxable earnings 5 seasonality of operations the third quarter november to january is normally the company s weakest quarter due to the shutdown of mining and exploration

washington there are lots of ways it seems to land on one of president donald trump s tariff hit lists countries can allegedly steal u s trade secrets or they can introduce a tax that the trump administration doesn t like or they can be unlucky enough to find themselves in such dire economic straits that their currencies go into a freefall making good on his campaign pledge to upend decades of u s policy in favour of a pugnacious america first approach trump has launched a series of protectionist broadsides against america s trading partners he s also strived to replace a 25 year old north american trade agreement with an updated version more to his liking so far though he s been stymied by the u s congress here s a look at some of the major items on trump s trade agenda advertisement a trade war with china for the past 17 months the world s top two economies have been locked in the biggest global trade war since the 1930s the trump administration accuses beijing of cheating in its quest to become the world s supreme leader in such cutting edge industries as robotics and driverless cars the administration backed by many u s business groups alleges that china steals technology forces u s companies to hand over trade secrets as the price of admission to its vast market and unfairly subsidizes china s tech companies while hogtying their foreign competitors in red tape trump has also railed against america s gaping trade deficit with china us 380 billion last year the president has imposed tariffs on more than 360 billion worth of chinese imports and plans to tax an additional 160 billion in goods on dec 15 a move that would extend his import taxes to just about everything china ships to the united states beijing has hit 120 billion in u s

satisfy the administration in october the two sides agreed to a modest deal that left the thorniest issues unresolved trump agreed not to proceed with plans to raise tariffs on some chinese goods beijing agreed to buy large quantities of u s farm exports but they have failed to finalize that so called phase 1 agreement and on tuesday trump warned that an agreement might not be reached until after the 2020 presidential election metals mayhem last year trump unsheathed a little used weapon in u s trade policy section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 to declare foreign steel and aluminum a threat to america s national security using that justification he imposed tariffs of 25 tariff on imported steel and 10 on aluminum but he exempted several countries argentina and brazil for instance avoided the tariffs by agreeing instead to accept quotas on their metal exports to the u s with one early morning tweet monday trump demolished that arrangement he accused argentina and brazil of manipulating their currencies lower in order to give their exporters an unfair price advantage in foreign markets it s true that brazil s real and argentina s peso have plummeted against the u s dollar but it s not because their governments have engaged in currency manipulation rather it s because their economies are in crisis brazil is contending with double digit unemployment and economic stagnation after two years of deep recession argentina is suffering from an economic crisis marked by runaway inflation huge debts and widespread poverty nafta 2 0 trump last year browbeat mexico and canada into agreeing to a rewrite of the north american free trade agreement but his version the u s mexico canada agreement or usmca still awaits approval from the u s congress having taken effect in 1994 the original nafta erased most trade barriers between the three economies and created a powerful regional trade bloc many u s manufacturers moved factories south of the border to capitalize on low wage mexican labour and ship products back to the united states duty free trump and other critics accused nafta of wiping out american manufacturing jobs trump warned that if he couldn t negotiate a better deal he d kill nafta altogether usmca emerged after more than a year of contentious negotiations the revamped deal is meant to return some factories and factory jobs to the united states among other things it requires that 40 to 45 of autos must be built where auto workers earn at least 16 an hour in order to qualify for the trade deal s duty free status but house democrats who must approve usmca insist that trump s version needs to be tweaked to ensure that it can be enforced they ve been negotiating changes with trump s top trade official robert lighthizer

virtually no one outside the white house supports the tariffs imposing them would widen a rift with europe and risk a backlash in congress where lawmakers are already considering scaling back the president s power to impose tariffs on national security grounds trump has sought to use the tariff threat to wring trade concessions out of japan and the european union prime minister shinzo abe has

industries labour markets and distribution of wealth he said some traditional industries agriculture for instance as well as mining and forestry are still quite vibrant he said but are simply being

industrial economies we re not doing horribly but we re certainly not knocking it out of the park either he said modest gains this year can be attributed to a hot second quarter said stratton in q2 we saw a huge increase in international exports partially due to rising oil and gas prices but after that our growth has been back at 1 2 per cent so we re not necessarily going into 2020 on a fast pace

of business i m talking to no matter what region or the size of the business one commonality i always hear is the need for skills he said the economy is changing at such a fast pace that the skills available to the labour market are not meeting the demand employment and population growth vary across the province as well as within its regions he noted it s declining in particular parts of northern ontario but not necessarily in sudbury or the northeastern part of ontario either he said we ve seen a largish decline in population for ontario as a whole but for sudbury it s actually been

over the global factors that have impeded its ability to grow i think it s rather timely that i appear right after november when we saw these large changes in nickel prices with the steepest monthly loss in eight years he said this is partially due to the indonesian export ban but also the decline in stainless steel operating rates in china due to trade tensions on a more positive note stratton pointed out the american congress seems poised to finally ratify the new trade deal between the u s canada and mexico that obviously would have a huge impact here on the local economy and on the

source xinhua 2019 12 04 23 22 40 editor yan video player close by dana halawi beirut dec 4 xinhua local experts said that lebanese authorities should not force people to use the lebanese currency to solve the crisis of the increase in u s dollar exchange rate to lebanese pound but should restore confidence in the government and banking system to reach their goal if we deal with the lebanese pound only this means that we should remove dollar deposits mounir rached president of the lebanese economic association told xinhua when we receive u s currency from outside the country banks would transfer them into lebanese pound directly which would lead to the absence of flow of money from other counties because people do not have confidence in the lebanese system and local currency rached added the lebanese pound has been pegged to the dollar since the 1990s and the exchange rate has always been fixed at 1507 5 lebanese pounds per u s dollar for decades lebanon depended on remittances to sustain its economy and the fixed exchange rate however the economic slowdown and the drop in cash injections from the lebanese abroad reduced the central bank s foreign currency reserves leading to a shortage in dollar for both businesses and individuals the demand for dollar has created a parallel market in which the dollar is being sold on the black market at more than 2 000 lebanese pounds which is higher than the official exchange rate the purchasing power of the lebanese people who get paid in lebanese pounds has dropped meanwhile panic in the market has increased prompting depositors to either demand the exchange of their pounds to dollars or the transfer of their money outside lebanon fearing the loss of their savings since the lebanese central bank and commercial banks hold a big percentage of the government s public debt as a result banks had to impose restrictions on withdrawals in dollar with a limit of up to 500 dollars weekly which caused inconvenience for individuals and businesses since 73 percent of deposits in lebanon are in dollar we cannot force people to stop using dollar because 73 percent of the deposits up till the end of september are in foreign currency we are a highly dollarized economy said nassib ghobril economist and head of the economic research department at byblos bank ghobril said that banks are not allowed to turn people s dollar deposits into lebanese without their consent he added that banks cannot encourage people to transfer their money from u s currency to lebanese pound nowadays because of the lack of confidence in the banking system and the local currency after it has been depreciated we cannot put laws to exchange lebanese pound to dollar in banks this should be a market based decision otherwise confidence will worsen even more he said riad obegi chairman and general manager of banque bemo suggested that the short term solution is for the central bank to inject u s currency in the market since it has around 33 billion dollars of foreign currencies in european and american banks the central bank should inject 10 billion dollars and it has the capacity to do so obegi said adding that this move is very essential to prevent social crises in the country he explained that people will soon no longer be able to go to hospitals or consume basic commodities since lebanon imports most of its products and manufacture only a small variety of items obegi added that authorities must restore confidence in the banking system because people do not believe them when they say that there won t be any haircut in lebanese banks no one will send money to lebanon since there is even a slight possibility to witness a haircut policy he said obegi also noted that the government must adopt reform measures and provide better management for its main sectors including electricity water and phone services which can generate huge revenues if properly managed rached said that the central bank should change its policies by going from a peg rate policy to a managed float of the currency policy he explained that the peg rate policy means the central bank should be ready to buy and sell as much as the market needs of foreign currency in dollar which is no longer the case nowadays rached said that a managed float policy would allow the central bank to intervene when needed to avoid sharp change in the exchange rate but this policy should be adopted among other measures such as reducing budget deficit which would reduce pressure on dollar this policy means that the market becomes aware that the central bank will interfere so it won t allow the exchange rate to change drastically he said ghobril said that banks have already started encouraging people to use the lebanese pound through checks and payment cards in addition to putting more restrictions on u s currency withdrawals than the local currency

calculating your personal cost if stock bond and house prices return to average we currently have well above average prices for stocks bonds and homes this raises a simple question what would happen to the average retirement account and to home equity for the average homeowner if valuations were to return to what long term averages show us are normal valuations using decades of valuation information on stocks bonds and homes this analysis develops numbers in each category that show how much of current national stock bond and home prices represents average values and how much is a premium above normal valuations using those historical values and the illustration of an example homeowner and retirement account investor it is demonstrated that the current premium is around 59 above long term average valuations how the loss of such a premium could have life changing implications for tens of millions of homeowners and retirement account investors is reviewed this analysis is part of a series of related analyses which support a book that is in the process of being written some key chapters from the book and an overview of the series are linked here abnormally high stock bond home prices analyzing what happens if prices return to average is also known as regression to the mean and it is one of the fundamental tools of financial analysis when we look at valuations over the long term for stocks bonds housing or almost any investment class what they all share is cycles of being higher than average at times cycles of being lower than average at times and then returning to that long term average valuation again and again as the cycles go up and down around the average whether we want to call it a return to average valuations or regression to the mean the key concept is that if we can identify prices that are well above historic averages after adjusting for inflation and changes in corporate earnings and so forth then over time they are likely to fall to average valuations and if we can identify prices that are abnormally cheap relative to long term averages then chances should be good that over time a return to average price levels may provide a particularly good return as can be seen in the graph above from chapter one link here 10 year u s treasury obligation prices are about 34 percent higher for the period between 2001 and 2018 than they were between the years 1962 and 2000 as developed in that and other chapters the very low interest rates and then monetary creation by the federal reserve in the containment of the damage from the popping of the tech stock bubble in 2001 and then the financial crisis of 2008 have fundamentally changed investment prices in all categories for stocks we are not looking at prices which rise with corporate earnings and the economy but how much investors pay when they buy a stock for each dollar of corporate earnings this key measure is what is known as the price earnings ratio or pe ratio if investors are paying a lot for corporate earnings meaning a high pe ratio then we have very rich valuations for stocks conversely if investors are paying very little for each dollar of corporate earnings meaning that pe ratios are low then shares are relatively cheap compared to long term averages pe ratios have been very high and on average are up by about 50 percent since 2001 we currently have record home prices across the country and because home prices rise with inflation that is reasonably common however even after we adjust for inflation and take home sizes and locations into account home prices are on average still unusually high across the country and are about 32 higher than long term averages we won t be going into the fourth column in this particular analysis but we also currently have had gold valuations since 2001 that are about 50 percent higher than the long term average even on an inflation adjusted basis an example retirement investor homeowner now let s take a round number look at a hypothetical investor with a million dollar net worth the advantage to a 1 million dollar net worth is that it s really easy to do quick percentage comparisons whether that is for someone with a 300 000 net worth or a 600 000 net worth or a 3 million net worth we will assume that this investor has 800 000 dollars in investments that they have built up primarily in retirement accounts we will also assume that they have a 500 000 home with a 300 000 dollar mortgage on it so a 60 loan to value a common allocation for investor who are either right on the cusp of retirement or perhaps have just retired used to be for 60 of their portfolio to be in stocks for reasons of seeking the highest returns and 40 in bonds for reasons of safety and cash flow however because bond yields have been so very low since 2001 many investors have been upping the allocation to the riskier stock component this is an example of the investor life cycle approach to financial planning where generally speaking the younger someone is the more of their portfolio is allocated to stocks and the older they are the more of their portfolio is allocated to bonds we will therefore use a 75 25 allocation between stocks and bonds in the illustration portfolio which would mean that 600 000 of the retirement investments are in stocks and 200 000 is invested in bonds for most retirement account investors these are more likely to be in mutual funds or etfs that are invested in stocks or bonds but the same numbers apply when we put it all together the 600 000 in stocks 200 000 in bonds and 200 000 in home equity add up to the round number 1 million starting net worth the next step is to take individual looks at each one of these categories on a historical basis and see what history shows us average valuations have been changes in average stock valuations the above is a graph of the s p 500 stock index on an inflation adjusted basis which we will use to represent stocks in general it is visually obvious that there has been an extraordinary increase in valuations since the mid 1990s however a big part of this is the growth in the american economy and the growth in corporate earnings to determine whether stock valuations are relatively high or relatively low compared to long term averages a better measure is to compare pe ratios the price investors pay for each dollar of corporate earnings that belongs to their percentage ownership of the corporation before the federal reserve began its extraordinary interest rate and monetary creation interventions the average pe ratio with historically average interest rates was 16 1 in the years from 1962 to 2000 from 2001 to 2018 the average pe ratio has been 23 9 which is about 50 above long term averages the other way of looking at this is that if we go from our more recent average pe ratio valuation of 23 9 and we return to that long term historical average valuation of 16 1 that would require taking a 33 hit to our stock price this may sound like a very bad scenario or some kind of extreme gloom and doom talk but that is not at all the case all that a 33 decline in stock prices would represent would be a regression to the mean a return to long term averages what we need to keep in mind when looking back at history is that prices are above average about half the time and below average about half the time keeping in mind that the median is not the same as the mean on a historical basis pe ratios were below 16 1 about half of the time so if we wanted to explore the actual downside we would need to look at the places where the purple pe line in the graph above goes well below the gold average line such as in the later 1970s and early 1980s between 1978 and 1982 pe ratios were bouncing up and down in around the 8 range or so this means that an actual downside scenario a market bottom involving higher interest rates and major economic difficulties could be in the neighborhood of a 67 loss from a 23 9 pe ratio instead of a 33 loss with eventual recovery and stabilization there could be a doubling in valuations bringing stock valuations and pe ratios back up to long term averages and a mere 33 discount relative to the current highly elevated stock valuations exploring gloomy downside scenarios is however not the point of this analysis all we are doing is looking at the impact on average investors and homeowners if valuations for stocks bonds and homes merely return to the long term average valuations that prevailed for decades before the fed s extraordinary interventions and not at the below average valuations that are necessarily about half of that history changes in average bond prices to compare more recent bond prices to long term averages we re going to look at a 10 year u s treasury obligation with a 7 interest coupon because that 7 is little bit below what average ten year yields were between 1962 and 2000 this bond would have had an average price of 98 2 cents on the dollar over those decades meaning investors would have paid 982 for a 1 000 bond of course in today s environment getting a government guaranteed 7 yield seems really high and on average between 2000 and 2018 investors would have paid 131 2 or 1 312 for a 1 000 bond when we compare a price of 1 312 to a price of 982 for the same bond that means that investors in a time when the fed has been creating unprecedented interest rate distortions have been paying a premium of 34 when buying ten year bonds going the other direction to go from a quite elevated price of 1 312 down to a long term average price of 982 would require taking a 25 loss bonds are of course highly variable with many variations based on term credit quality and whether they are government corporate or tax exempt obligations using the 10 year treasury is meant to establish a reasonable approximation some bonds would have greater losses and some less and again the intent of this particular analysis is to put some numbers on what a return to long term averages could mean for average people and not to explore downside scenarios looking back at history and as can be seen above the downside scenario would be something in the range of a 50 loss as one example this could happen if the fed lost control even as the national debt was still climbing fast which could lead to simultaneous drastic increases in both interest rates and inflation that could happen but it is a different thing from exploring a simple regression to the mean changes in average home prices the above graph takes a look at single family housing prices on a national basis it combines a dollar price for a nationally average home for 2017 with percentage changes in the national freddie mac house price index and also adjusts for inflation in 2018 dollars a home with a size equal to the average for 2017 homes would have had a long term average price of 159 465 over the years from 1975 to 2000 that same nationally average home would have had an average price of 210 775 in the years from 2001 through 2018 when we compare the 210 775 average price for more recent years to the 159 465 price for an equivalent home over the longer term then homes have been priced an average of 32 higher than they used to be in inflation adjusted dollars as covered in much more detail in other chapters the extraordinary federal reserve interest rate and monetary creation interventions since 2001 have led to far below average mortgage rates which have supported much higher home prices than used to be the case when we go the other direction then a return to historically normal mortgage rates and historically average home prices could on a national basis lead to a 24 average decline in home values on an inflation adjusted basis now an interesting thing about housing is that it used to be much less correlated with financial markets than the other asset categories of stocks and bonds with more stable valuations that were less subject to cyclical changes so when we look at a downside scenario and assume that the nation were to go all the way down to the lowest annual valuations from 1975 to 2000 in inflation adjusted terms then housing would lose about 32 of its value when compared to more recent averages this is far from desirable but not nearly as bad as the 67 loss with stocks or the 50 loss with bonds combining the losses in each category when we put all of this information together and compare the averages from 2001 through 2018 to the long term averages for each asset category then we get the graph above a regression to the mean or return to averages would involve a 25 loss on bonds a 33 loss on stocks and a 24 loss on inflation adjusted home values when we take these percentages and apply them to our example retirement investor and homeowner with the round number million dollar net worth then we get the graph below we begin with the assumed 600 000 starting stock portfolio calculate the cost of the 33 loss with a few more significant digits that would be associated with a return to long term average stock valuations and find that there would be about a 200 000 loss if we take a look at a 200 000 starting bond portfolio and we apply the 25 percent loss that is required to return to historic average bond valuations then the loss would be about 50 000 if all of the starting 800 000 were in retirement accounts then combining the stock and bond losses associated with a mere return to long term averages would reduce the value of the retirement savings by about 250 000 or a quarter of a million dollars if we take a half million dollar home and apply the 24 loss that would be associated with a return to long term inflation adjusted home valuations then that would be about a 120 000 dollar loss in total the combined losses required to return the stocks bonds and home to historically average valuations would be equal to about 370 000 which equates to a 37 reduction in net worth for some who started out with a million dollar net worth as extreme as this would likely sound to many people keep in mind that this is not a downside scenario but simply a regression to the mean about half of long term financial history consists of lower asset prices than the averages that are shown above and in many cases these prices are quite a bit lower net worth with historically average asset values in step one we started with a 1 million net worth at the average elevated valuations of recent years in step two we adjusted for the changes necessary to move stock bond and home prices down the long term averages of prior decades when we combine the first and second steps then we get step three as shown above what our example retirement account investor and homeowner would actually have with historically normal asset values instead of owning 600 000 of stocks those exact same shares would be worth about 400 000 with a historically average pe ratio instead of owning 200 000 in bonds those exact same bonds would be worth about 150 000 with historically average interest rates instead of having a house worth 500 000 a more historically normal home price for the same home would be about 380 000 and if that person had bought the 500 000 home with a 300 000 mortgage and the price were to later return to a long term average value of 380 000 then instead of 200 000 in home equity they would have about 80 000 in home equity on the exact same house same stocks same bonds and same house all it takes is returning to long term asset valuations for all three asset categories and the net worth of the illustrated retirement investor and homeowner would be about 630 000 instead of the prior 1 million another and perhaps better way of looking at this is that about 370 000 of the example 1 million net worth is not natural but rather represents abnormally high stock bond and home valuations that have been created by the federal reserve s heavy handed interest rate and monetary creation interventions what long term financial history shows us is that the natural net worth for someone owning those same stocks bonds and home is about 630 000 so that investor and the nation is currently enjoying about a 59 premium 1 000 000 630 000 159 above their natural net worth with long term valuations and if they look at that 59 premium and they would like to keep it and they don t want to unexpectedly lose it in the coming years then perhaps the single most important part of their financial planning process involves understanding why values are so high what could bring those values back down to average what the chances of that happening are looking like at any given time and what they could potentially do about without that knowledge they could be subject to the defining and life changing financial blindside of their lives at any given time keep in mind that if such a regression to the mean were to occur such a return to average valuations then the loss of this 59 premium would apply to all of the tens of millions of the people in the united states who do have retirement accounts invested in stocks and bonds and who do own their homes now the specifics would of course vary greatly but in broad strokes these same valuation principles would apply with some people facing more damage and others facing less those who would be devastated include many of our friends family neighbors and colleagues and it would be truly life changing it would fundamentally change spending and the economy for the nation it would fundamentally change standards of living in retirement for the nation and it would likely come as a complete surprise for most of the nation a reasonable moderate reality check my guess is that for millions of the people who would be the most affected what is presented herein would be interpreted as some sort of far out or even apocalyptic gloom and doom scenario that was not at all my intention in preparing this analysis nor is that what is presented herein i think most people who are reasonably well read in finance are very well aware that stock valuations are unusually high interest rates are unusually low which means bond prices are unusually high and housing prices across the nation are unusually high there is nothing controversial about those beliefs variations on them can be found in numerous articles in the financial media on just about any given day there are some natural and very important questions that arise from that situation how high are these asset values compared to the norms why are they so high what is the exposure of the average person to a return to normal values what sorts of things could bring about such an return and how likely are they in many ways what this book in process is all about is attempting to answer those questions in ways that can be understood by people who are not necessarily financial or economic professionals what i did in this particular analysis was to look at three of the most important asset categories for individuals and put some real numbers on the situation using the actual historical numbers from the most reputable heart of the financial mainstream if you look at the bottom left corner of the graphs of the averages the sources include databases from the federal reserve freddie mac standard poor s via robert shiller and the bureau of labor statistics a researcher or academic might quibble with the years chosen or some of the particulars of the methodology used but these are the actual histories for those asset classes assembled from what are considered to be the best available sources keep in mind as well that about half of those databases consist of valuations that are lower than the averages presented this truly is not an alarmist scenario but a middle of the road scenario when we look at the differences in average values the reduction in net worth from the illustrated 1 million down to 630 000 and the loss of the 59 premium then what we are looking at is what could be the single most important event in a lifetime of investing and home ownership for many millions of people with this being particularly true of the boomers unlike the generations before them the boomers on average will have many more years to live in retirement on whatever savings they have and unlike the generations behind them if there is a steep fall in asset prices then the boomers are unlikely to have the time to rebuild their savings before their target retirement age the point of this analysis was to present a reasonable and moderate reality check not any sort of doomsday scenario we do have the highest asset prices in history even after adjusting for inflation and the growth in corporate earnings when we look at the combination of stock values bond values and home values this analysis put reasonable numbers on just high those valuations are relative to historic averages a fundamental principle of achieving genuine financial security is to at a minimum be able to handle a regression to the mean a return to average values this analysis put reasonable numbers on the decline in stock bond and home values that would need to be covered in such a case let s step back and consider the situation if a person would be devastated by a mere return to average and they therefore reject even the possibility of a simple return to average as being emotionally unacceptable are they really achieving financial security is the financial planning that will play a key role in determining their standard of living for potentially the rest of their lives really built on a sound foundation in that case or on something else altogether the time to fully understand these issues is before they happen when there is still room for better decisions and time to make changes i hope that the financial analysis and historical information provided herein has been helpful to you in that regard identifying some parameter for answering the key questions why are asset values so high what could bring them down to earth what could send them still higher what is in play right now that can give us better understandings of what is happening as explored in chapter one the underlying foundation for historically elevated asset prices is extraordinary and heavy handed federal reserve interventions that have forced historically low interest rates on the nation anyone who s been keeping cash in money market funds or interest bearing checking accounts or who is reliant upon any form of interest income is of course very well aware of this problem as shown above and also explored in chapter one there is something that is even more important and irrational which is that the federal reserve is forcing interest rates down to levels that are on average below the rate of inflation this is not a place that investors will rationally go on their own at least not for sustained periods of time indeed if we look at the period from 1962 to 2000 before the extraordinary federal reserve interventions investors quite rationally demanded that even overnight investments bear interest rates that were on average more than two percent above the rate of inflation since 2001 the federal reserve has forced the nation down to what is on average a 0 61 inflation adjusted yield in high quality overnight loans this is an extraordinary intervention that is changing all asset values another change has been the fed s extraordinary and unprecedented use of monetary creation flooding the markets with cash to move rates and prices where the federal reserve wants them to go what is shown in the blue above is the unprecedented policies the federal reserve has been engaging in since the financial crisis of 2008 creating money through a process that is usually referred to as quantitative easing the federal reserve has been creating trillions of dollars out of what is effectively the nothingness and using that money to buy things like u s treasury obligations and mortgage backed securities directly forcing prices well above historic averages and indirectly setting the foundation for the highly elevated stock and home prices that we see today a third issue is the critical factor of the u s national debt reaching dangerous levels which reinforces the need for very low interest rates that in turn maintain very high asset prices for stocks bonds and homes a change that is really coming to the fore as we enter the 2020s is that the u s government s voracious need for cash to fund the rapid growth of the 23 trillion national debt is beginning to threaten the federal reserve s control over interest rates not just in theory but in real time as covered in chapter 18 link here this then creates the situation that the true immediate danger from a soaring national debt is not so much a distant default or round of hyperinflation but higher interest rates that could rapidly bring stock bond and home prices back down towards the historic averages shown herein with the corresponding life changing implications for many millions of people it is highly ironic what while many investors are not taking historically elevated asset prices into account in their planning even while they are blithely unconcerned about any personal impact from the national debt it may very well that at some point it is the national debt and deficits that triggers the interest rate increases that could lead to situations such as the loss of the 59 premium for them and the nation what all of these factors have in common is that they aren t fair they are complicated they are outside of what people are told they need to know in order to have the financial education needed to make good personal decisions inflation adjusted interest rates federal reserve monetary policies monetary creation and the funding of the national debt are just not what most people are taught to think about when they are making decisions about stocks bonds or their homes relatively few people have the appropriate education in these areas in this book i have been trying to close that gap i believe it is essential to do so and

we are facing a corporate debt bomb that is far far greater than what we faced in 2008 and we are being warned that this unexploded bomb will amplify everything once the financial system starts melting down thanks to exceedingly low interest rates over the last decade u s corporations have been able to go on the greatest corporate debt binge in history it has been a tremendous boom but it has also set the stage for a tremendous bust large corporations all over the country are now really struggling to deal with their colossal debt burdens and defaults on the riskiest class of corporate debt are on pace to hit their highest level since 2008 everyone can see that a major corporate debt disaster is looming but nobody seems to know how to stop it at this point companies listed on our stock exchanges have accumulated a total of almost 10 trillion dollars of debt that is equivalent to approximately 47 percent of u s gdp a decade of historically low interest rates has allowed companies to sell record amounts of bonds to investors sending total u s corporate debt to nearly 10 trillion or a record 47 of the overall economy in recent weeks the federal reserve the international monetary fund and major institutional investors such as blackrock and american funds all have sounded the alarm about the mounting corporate obligations we have never witnessed a corporate debt crisis of this magnitude living a life that rea michael snyder best price 14 48 buy new 14 53 as of 06 20 utc details corporate debt is up a whopping 52 percent since 2008 and this bubble is continually growing and actually the 10 trillion dollar figure is the most conservative number out there because if you add in all other forms of corporate debt the grand total comes to 15 5 trillion dollars the following comes from forbes total corporate debt is actually much higher adding the debt of small medium sized enterprises family businesses and other business which are not listed in stock exchanges ads another 5 5 trillion in other words total us corporate debt is 15 5 trillion 74 of us gdp needless to say this mountain of corporate debt is definitely not sustainable and i have already noted that defaults are rising one expert recently explained that all of this debt is an exploded bomb and that at some point something will come along to trigger the explosion we are sitting on the top of an unexploded bomb and we really don t know what will trigger the explosion said emre tiftik a debt specialist at the institute of international finance an industry association right now a lot of large corporations are so maxed out that they can barely service their debts so when things start getting really bad for the economy we could be facing a wave of defaults unlike anything we have ever seen before when asked about what this will mean during the next recession a finance professor at the university of pennsylvania warned that it will make everything happen faster larger worse it s going to amplify everything said krista schwarz a finance professor at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school it s going to make everything happen faster larger worse the recession would just be that much deeper it sounds like she could be a writer for the economic collapse blog of course i am being a bit silly but the truth is that there is nothing silly about the giant mountain of debt that our society is facing in addition to our looming corporate debt crisis u s consumers are 14 trillion dollars in debt state and local government debt levels are at record highs and the u s national debt just hit the 23 trillion dollar mark if you can believe it we have actually added another 1 3 trillion dollars to the national debt just since last thanksgiving the federal debt has increased by 1 303 466 578 471 45 since last thanksgiving according to data released by the u s treasury that is the largest thanksgiving to thanksgiving increase in the debt in nine years the last time the debt increased more from thanksgiving to thanksgiving was in 2010 when it increased by 1 785 995 360 978 10 it also equals approximately 10 137 48 per household in the united states adding 1 3 trillion dollars to the national debt in 12 months while things are still relatively stable is utter insanity and what we are doing to future generations of americans is beyond criminal and we aren t even spending the money well in fact senator rand paul continues to document how we are wasting money in some of the most ridiculous ways imaginable sen rand paul is continuing to expose the rampant waste of tax dollars by our government agencies in a special fall edition of his waste report the kentucky senator highlights some of the most wasteful expenditures of our federal government including a half a million dollar toilet nobody could use and a 22 million project to bring serbian cheeses up to international standards once again the waste report takes a closer look at just some of what the federal government is doing with the american people s hard earned money this time including stories of it continuing to turn over so many taxpayer dollars to the washington metropolitan area transit authority funding research that involves hooking zebrafish on nicotine buying textbooks for afghan students that are subpar or sitting in warehouses and more in a list that totals over 230 million states a press release from sen paul s office of course it isn t just the united states that is drowning under an ocean of red ink as bloomberg has detailed when you total up all forms of debt in the world it comes to a grand total of 250 trillion dollars zombie companies in china crippling student bills in america sky high mortgages in australia another default scare in argentina a decade of easy money has left the world with a record 250 trillion of government corporate and household debt that s almost three times global economic output and equates to about 32 500 for every man woman and child on earth so if you have a household of four your share comes to 130 000 the beginning of the end michael snyder best price 9 97 buy new 18 08 as of 07 00 utc details are you ready to pay up in the end all of this debt will never be paid off instead the bubble will just keep ballooning until it inevitably bursts and when it finally bursts many are warning of a complete and total meltdown in fact rick ackerman believes that a mad max scenario is likely ackerman contends i am a little more bearish than that i see a mad max scenario as inevitable i try not to think about it because we ve all got lives to live and kids to raise when you go back to the calculous of deflation and that every penny of every debt must be paid if not by the borrower then by the lender we have already put ourselves into a condition where social security is going to fail medicare is going to fail all the just in time deliveries are going to be in jeopardy food from the grocery stores one day shipping from amazon i don t see how all these things can continue to operate in a condition other than in the false prosperity that we have now we are at the pinnacle of affluence i haven t been able to find anyone that can logically argue that the road that we are currently on has a positive ending the truth is that we are headed for complete and total disaster and the only real debate is about how long it will take for us to get there so enjoy these moments of relative stability while you still can because it is only a matter of time before

concerning the united kingdom s exit from the european union there are views that the chances of a no deal brexit will remain even if the conservatives win the dec 12 general election even after the brexit deal agreed on between british prime minister boris johnson and the eu is approved by parliament and takes effect jan 31 the theories go the talks for a free trade pact that will define future relations between britain and the eu will need to be concluded by the end of the transition period through the end of 2020 in the case they fail to do so the u k and the eu will face january 2021 without an accord that define their trade relations creating a state of no deal brexit the financial times on nov 22 noted that while johnson and phil hogan the eu s new trade commissioner believe the negotiations next year will not require much time because britain has been an eu member for 46 years a senior official of the european commission says the talks will be a difficult process for the u k since it has little experience in trade negotiations and that other eu members will likely call on the commission to take a tough position toward britain
business as usual has been harder borders are there other ways to address climate migration they said the hunger strike was because the eggs were moldy and the food had maggots on oct 18 some 200 detainees at the private prison known as the northwest detention center which management recently rebranded as the northwest ice processing center went on hunger strike work stoppages for detainees on kitchen detail were also held the seven day strike was the first one of the year at the center which has had many in recent memory there was more too a new head of geo group the company that owns the prison in tacoma allegedly forced detainees to stand before they entered rooms under threat of punishment including solitary confinement maru mora villalpando local activist and co founder of la resistencia which organizes against the detention center relayed what people inside were telling her we re being given trash to eat and at the same time you have these old trays and the machine doesn t really wash them the entire conditions created a moment where people went on hunger strike mora villalpando said finally because nothing was done things kept being the same way then they went on a hunger strike in the months after an activist was shot and killed outside of the processing center geo group has renamed the facility and started allowing reporters inside for what activists have called a sanitized tour in september a group of journalists were given a tour of the facility one report from q13 saw detention center employees showcasing televisions and computers to the reporter later during the tour detainees were shouting that they were hungry and not being fed around 60 of the people being held at the detention center have been shipped there from the southern border mora villalpando said children are not housed at the center meaning many of the detainees are likely separated from their families there s a lot of people from everywhere mora villalpando said obviously for those that have relatives we get a lot of calls from people outside the state trying to locate their loved ones here access to medical care is also an issue as documented in 2018 by seattle weekly nationwide around 50 000 people are locked away in immigration camps and prisons according to the federal government it s the tip of the spear of a brand of immigration policy that has been enacted by every u s president since bill clinton decided to get tough on immigration in the 1990s public radio international reports that climate change is putting pressure on central and latin america and that a system of borders camps and deportations could be the federal government s response to migrants and refugees in the coming decades predictions climate change in and of itself is only one of the factors that plays into migration kayly ober is a senior advocate for climate displacement at refugees international she said often times climate change is part of the mixture when people decide to move climate change can exacerbate some of the principal factors ober said in syria before its civil war there were issues of poor governance related to water but drought made it worse it s debatable how much the drought was caused by climate change and for that matter how much of the complex social mixture of government repression religious conflict foreign intervention and drought came together to create on of the worst refugee crisis in modern times climate change often acts as an accelerant adding fuel to existing tensions throughout the world and especially in the global south where the effects of a hotter earth will be felt more acutely the world bank in 2018 conducted a study looking at the impacts of climate change on sub saharan africa south asia and latin america the study found that in those three densely populated areas some 140 million people could become refugees many of them would likely be internal refugees moving from low lying areas of their countries that are susceptible to sea level rise for example to other places rural areas will likely become more depopulated as people head toward major cities as climate change destroys crops and makes traditional agricultural livelihoods more difficult to sustain according to the united states agency for international development but in many areas of the world traditional centers of migration like mumbai india may be unlivable closer to the u s hurricanes are likely to begin stalling over caribbean nations for longer periods of time causing more damage ober said this needs to be in the forefront of our minds as those kinds of disasters increase in the near future ober said hurricane dorian in particular stalled over the bahamas for more than 24 hours historically the u s has offered many people displaced by natural disasters temporary protected status or tps the trump administration is trying to revoke tps for hundreds of thousands of people in the country and lawsuits challenging it are ongoing according to media reports there is no special status for people fleeing the effects of climate change and ober said it is unlikely the u s will ever have a special designation or category for climate displaced people what she suggested instead would be a program similar to tps but with a pathway to citizenship local level king county is developing a new five year climate action plan which is designed for communities that will likely bear a disproportionate amount of the impact the county board of health met on nov 21 to discuss the new plan and heard from a panel comprised of people working within communities of color to address climate preparedness one panelist was nourah yonous a somali immigrant who started the organization african women business alliance she works with immigrant women to help grow and stabilize their businesses she said there will likely be an influx of climate migrants coming and that local government could do more in particular communities could use more tools to cope with climate change we are not really well prepared she said of local governments when communities of color aren t being given tangible and culturally responsive tools to address issues like displacement economic injustice or food insecurity government action doesn t lead to communities being more climate resiliant instead it s a bandage she said for that reason i think it s very important for us to know that these issues are connected she said improving public transit building more affordable energy efficient housing increasing solar and wind power and reducing transit fares could all help immigrant communities once they arrive the county will be looking at its climate plan with environmental justice as an integral part instead of an add on it could help climate immigrants and refugees here deal with some of the same issues that perhaps led them to leave countries in the first place in a wider view mora villalpando said the u s should return to immigration laws prior to the clinton crackdown in 1996 clinton signed a harsh immigration bill called the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act which restricted many ways for people to become citizens for example before the bill was signed immigrants who had been in the u s for seven years could get legal status if they showed it would cause extreme hardship to get deported vox reported this practice was ended by clinton this came on the heels of dirty wars and counter insurgency coin operations promoted and conducted u s intelligence agencies in the 1980s operations that destroyed both the governments and the social fabrics of countries throughout latin america this is the argument that investigative journalist and professor christian parenti makes dirty 80s largely left out of political discourse surrounding immigration is one of the key drivers of it u s backed violence during the cold war this ranged from supporting security forces in guatemala as they committed genocide against indigenous mayan peoples to the reagan administration smoothing over u s involvement in massacres across latin america the u s government in its quest against communism decided to back dictators in chile argentina peru el salvador nicaragua guatemala uruguay and more many of these regimes committed human rights abuses for example the u s backed the right wing military government in el salvador which left 75 000 dead in 2009 the obama administration and hillary clinton supported a coup in honduras that destabilized the country the u s also conducted or promoted counter insurgency coin operations these operations are distinct from traditional warfare parenti said whereas traditional warfare focuses on capturing and controlling territory counter insurgency relies on prying insurgents from their support base this results often in the destruction of traditional societal ties breaking apart countries following decades of intervention much of latin america was left with weakened governments a fragmented society and a power vacuum that allowed gangs and narcotics trafficking to set up shop the u s proxy wars in central america in the 1980s were really damaging to the social fabric because those were counter insurgency conflicts parenti said the counter insurgency in central america in the 1980s seeded the region with a kind of trauma that kind of shows up as astonishing levels of violence this was something mora villalpando also talked about countries currently experiencing upheaval in latin america have generally experienced either u s backed violence or have been stricken by international monetary fund austerity and have been pressured to cut social safety nets and services it is important to realize that when people complain about migration there s a lot to blame to the united states government in creating the conditions in the first place and forcing us to migrate mora villalpando said mora villalpando who herself is undocumented said she left mexico in the 1990s before nafta was signed the free trade agreement flooded the country with cheap international goods forcing local producers and farmers out of the market and often into poverty parenti reports that all this sets the stage for even greater effects from climate change as weakened governments are less likely to be able to respond to natural and economic disasters mora villalpando said migration is likely to continue along the southern border and even increase in coming decades as climate change affects them more severely than countries in the global north the impact is not going to be on those nations it s going to be on the global south they don t have any other recourse mora villalpando said migration will explode in numbers divorced from its historical roots more people seeking refuge in the u s provides ample political fodder for nationalist rhetoric in the u s every u s president since clinton has deported hundreds of thousands of people climate change and the armed lifeboat in the 1970s ecologist garrett hardin developed an anti immigration strain of political reasoning it goes something like this say there s a lifeboat with room for five but there s 20 passengers in the water what should be done hardin argued that if all the people come onto the lifeboat everyone dies resources should be protected even at the expense of others this is the type of thinking that parenti argues governments seem to be adopting in the global north from european countries building fences to keep out syrian refugees to u s presidents including obama and trump appeasing nationalist sentiments to more heavily enforce the southern border countries around the world are sending a message to current and future refugees and migrants parenti doesn t think it s necessarily an organized response to climate change but may set a precedent for how the u s could respond as climate change leads to increased immigration the u s military has been preparing for climate destabilization since at least 2004 according to the guardian even as politicans tried to cast doubt on the scientific consensus that climate change is happening immigrant workers can benefit the economy parenti said but currently undocumented workers face a number of hurdles and are more vulnerable to exploitation increasing rights for immigrants and workers could help combat the idea of the armed lifeboat to have a section of the working class that is without legal rights and is terrified and will not join unions that harms the entire working population parenti said so people need to realize that it is in their immediate and direct economic self interest to make sure that immigrant workers have the right to struggle for their rights as workers granting more protection to immigrants climate driven or otherwise would help give people power parenti said if employers couldn t pay a segment of undocumented workers less than natural born workers more legal protection would raise wages for everyone parenti said he s also in favor of a green new deal and buying into green technology while removing subsidies for the fossil fuel industry jobs packages have been a topic in green new deal discussions as has the idea of medicare for all which could help soften the blows from climate change for everyone ultimately though americans could have a choice continue with business as usual or find new ways to handle migrants and refugees as climate change and the legacy of u s cold war policy affect their neighbors to the south for us it s very important to explain that what the current administration s policy is doing is the same mora villalpando said it s just 10 times bigger

samidoun is one of the organizational signatories of the following anti imperialist statement on iran and sanctions to add your name please use this link this statement signed by many people listed at the bottom demands an end to u s sanctions on iran and seeks to prevent war while we stand in solidarity with the iranian people who have risen up over recent weeks against domestic repression and neoliberalism as people in the u s we highlight the culpability of u s imperialism ______ as anti imperialist activists scholars artists and lawyers located in the united states we stand in solidarity with the peoples of latin america africa and asia in their calls to end imperialism sectarianism and neoliberalism and we view the recent protests in iran within this broader international context of resistance the global turn to the right has led to the increasing liberalization of the international economy and worsening political repression in countries throughout the world from bolivia chile colombia and haiti to guinea lebanon iraq and iran people have put their lives on the line to confront the twin evils of monopoly capital and u s imperial domination manifesting in different forms including coup governments war mongering and sanctions regimes as part of the current u s imperial project president trump has imposed the most severe sanctions regime in world history on iran seeking to choke the economy of the islamic republic out of existence but it is the people of iran who suffer they no longer have proper access to medical supplies industrial equipment and basic food staples the air quality has hit an all time low resulting in high levels of illness and inflation is worse than it has ever been in 2018 the international monetary fund imf developed a restructuring plan to address the economic shortfalls created by the sanctions regime in this plan the imf recommended mobilizing tax revenue removing exemptions reducing fuel subsidies and reforming the pension system alongside a medium term debt management strategy the imf claimed these policies should be pursued despite the challenging domestic and geopolitical environment that the nation faces with the overall objective of supporting iran as it transition to a market based monetary policy framework just weeks ago the islamic republic succumbed to one of the most severe proposals in the imf plan announcing a more than 100 percent increase in the cost of fuel on the first 60 liters purchased and a 300 percent increase on anything above 60 liters this reduction in subsidies has led to massive protests throughout the country because iranians recognize that it would lead to a dramatic and sudden decline in their standard of living in essence the united states imperial sanctions regime has opened the space for neoliberal economic institutions such as the imf to facilitate the ravaging of the iranian economy this project is not without its iranian native informants and cheerleaders who serve as functionaries of u s imperialism these functionaries seek regime change no matter the cost even though iran has only recently stabilized after the horrors of the iran iraq war if iran loses its sovereignty and descends into civil war like its immediate neighbors iraq and afghanistan or proxy war like syria and libya it is worth the cost because these functionaries stand to profit and benefit from war reconstruction and the exploitation of the nation s resources such functionaries are supported in their cause by iranian native informants so called intellectuals who opportunistically appropriate the protests under the guise of supporting human rights and liberal democracy when in fact what they seek is a return to neocolonial governance in the form of a u s backed regime not unlike that of the deposed monarchy or a regime led by the national council of iran a front organization for the u s backed fringe group mojaheddin e khalq also trained by the cia to execute the demands of the u s we believe that if the islamic republic falls under the weight of the u s sanctions regime or as a result of israeli and american aggression not only will the iranian nation suffer catastrophic losses but whatever form of government that follows will be far more violent and destructive considering all the external pressures on iran the people of iran are resisting the economic political and militaristic violence imposed on them both by international and domestic elites the majority of the iranian people do not seek regime change because they have already lived through two monumental events that destabilized their lives the iranian revolution of 1979 and the iran iraq war that lasted from 1980 until 1988 the elder generations can still recount the horrors that followed the toppling of prime minister mossadegh during the u s and british backed coup of 1953 iranians seek economic and political stability and above all they seek to maintain their national and individual dignity we stand by them and their calls for domestic reform and as people in the united states we demand the end of the sanctions regime and u s and israeli interference in the lives of the iranian

the market has swung sharply for months on every hint of progress or setbacks about talks between the world s largest economies and the latest flip flop followed a report from bloomberg news saying us negotiators expect a phase 1 trade agreement to be completed before us tariffs are set to rise on chinese products on december 15 the spi200 futures contract was up 58 0 points or 0 9 per cent at 6 669 at 7 15am aedt suggesting an early rise for the benchmark s p asx200 on thursday it s a much friendlier picture than the brutal market sell off on wednesday when fears a trade deal may not be reached until after next year s us election rattled the asx and saw the benchmark s p asx 200 index post its largest two day percentage slide since early august 1 are trade talks still progressing market volatility eased last night after us president donald trump and his administration talked up trade talk progress that saw an appetite for risk being popped back on the table during overnight trade and it s setting up the asx for a rally this morning brexit developments also stoked the market s animal spirits as polling showed the conservative party extending its lead in the british election race the bank of canada met and delivered a pretty upbeat hawkish decision to hold rates steady oil prices climbed after the us crude oil inventories report and ahead of this week s opec meeting in the australian trading session ahead all eyes will be on local retail sales data 2 sentiment flips and volatility drops sentiment flipped last night as the tone of trade war news changed once again reports flowed from bloomberg in early european trade citing sources close to the talks that trade negotiations continue to progress well and that a deal is still possible before levies are scheduled to be hiked again in 2020 the reports were somewhat supported by us president donald trump last night who in a press conference stated that trade talks are going very well fear turned to hope at least on the surface of things with the investor fear gauge vix falling back to the 14 mark and risk assets generally climbing 3 stocks recover ground asx ought to jump other sharemarkets also recovered overnight setting the asx200 up for a robust 50 point rally at today s open the question for traders this week has been whether the sell off in equity markets was simply a pullback in prices driven by a shift in sentiment or whether a bigger turnaround was in play based on deep rooted concerns about economic fundamentals the balance of opinion has shifted to the latter that is with valuations having become rich and sentiment clearly imbalanced the market needed this little shake out of course everything still hinges on the us and china remaining friendly but for now traders are feeling more confident that everything is still okay 4 brexit news also supports risk appetite so markets wait and see and keep watch on that december 15 deadline when new tariffs are set to kick in outside of the us china trade talks markets were given a small reason to be cheerful as the most recent british election polling showed the conservative party extending its lead the poll has boosted hopes that the tories will win a majority government at next week s election and with it a mandate to pass their brexit withdrawal agreement by the end of january the news coupled with a weaker us dollar propelled the british pound higher last night trading into the 1 30 as of this morning and to levels not seen since may 2017

image white house usd slides as market rebuked white house trade aggression trump says u s china deal may have to wait until after election comes amid chinese response to hong kong and xinjiang bills and with progress toward a phase one trade deal still nonexistent retaliation against french dst and over airbus levies also rankles demonstrates trump has appetite for tariffs despite growth slowdown the dollar slumped against almost all rivals tuesday as markets expressed disapproval of white house rhetoric on the u s china trade talks and a u s decision to hit french exports with new tariffs which has enabled the pound to dollar rate to again test a key resistance level on the charts president donald trump said tuesday that a phase one deal to end the trade war between the u s and china could be delayed until after the november 2020 presidential election roiling markets that had been led to believe such a thing would be finalised and formally entered into before the year is out markets neglected to acknowledge a recent change for the worse in white house language on the trade talks with china instead preferring to continue betting on an end to the tariff fight and a resulting stabilisation of the global economy that saw them caught unawares tuesday by comments from president trump whose gone from claiming that a deal has already been struck to simply stating that one is possible december 15 will see new tariffs imposed on all of china s remaining annual trade with the u s that s not yet been subjected to punitive duties unless president trump decides otherwise markets had hoped the levies would be averted by a phase one deal but commerce secretary wilbur ross said monday that if an agreement is not finalised before the middle of this month then the new tariffs will be go into effect fx investors appear to have reacted to ad hoc comments actions from both sides which perhaps signaled a prolonged impasse beyond year end the trend in this regard seemed to start when commerce secretary ross told reporters yesterday that a tariff increase was likely if the us and china did not reach a phase 1 accord news about tariffs on us imports from the eu and chinese blacklists added to the effect says stephen gallo european head of fx strategy at bmo capital markets trump said ahead of a nato summit in london that he does not have a deadline for finalising the deal that he already said on october 11 was in the bag he then said it could better to wait until after the november 2020 election to finalise the pact which would mean that crushing u s tariffs continue to be levied on imports from china for much of the next year above u s dollar performance vs major rivals on tuesday there has been speculation in recent months that china itself might like to wait until after the election before striking a deal just in case trump fails to get re elected meanwhile investors had also speculated that electoral considerations would likely temper trump s appetite for tariffs given they can also have an adverse impact on the countries deploying them commerce secretary wilbur ross reiterated in an interview with cnbc tuesday president trump s earlier assertion that the december 15 tariffs will go ahead if a deal has not been finalised before then the chances of a deal by dec 15th just took another turn lower markets simply aren t priced for this for a trade deal to be that far in the future if one can even be struck at all says mark wilson chief market analyst at markets com after weeks of making generally positive noises on a deal being very close there is a real sense now that a deal is not so very near at all and markets need to reprice combined with the barrage of tariff threats on the eu the comments can be taken as a sign that the white house has no qualms about levying further tariffs and is happy about using trade as a economic political and diplomatic weapon trump s comments came hard on the heels of a decision by the office of the u s trade representative ustr recommended that tariffs of up to 100 be applied to imports of french goods worth some 2 4 bn each year in retaliation against president emmanuel macron s digital services tax that s due to come into force next year the u s says the tax discriminates against u s companies is inconsistent with international tax conventions and unusually burdensome for companies affected by it monday s report which concludes a section 301 investigation came at the same time as the ustr said it will also look to begin the process of increasing existing tariff rates on some eu goods in response to a world trade organization ruling in a long running dispute over subsidies for airbus the u s has successfully argued that eu support for airbus is illegal under wto rules and that it s cost american companies revenue it already targeted european exports of agricultural goods airplanes and scotch whisky in october after the wto estimated lost revenue to be around 7 5 bn above dollar index shown at daily intervals tuesday s trade headlines follow the influential institute for supply management manufacturing pmi for november which surprised on the downside monday and prompted economists to suggest the recent rebound in the barometer was just a temporary phenomenon that s also had markets looking once again at the federal reserve fed but this time while contemplating exactly what a material reassessment of the outlook might actually mean in reality starting from the time the ism manufacturing pmi was released yesterday there has been a squeeze on long usd positions across the g10 space which has been somewhat offset by renewed rmb weakness during the london morning says bmo s gallo the north american data calendar is fairly empty today as mentioned yesterday the ability of the usd to end the week above 1 210 00 in bbdxy terms hangs on geopolitical headlines and the relative performance of us vs european economic data yesterday s weak ism report from the us has clearly been a headwind for the usd the fed has cut interest rates three times this year to defend the u s from an ongoing global economic slowdown but investor concerns about other economies have thus far prevented the dollar from weakening in any meaningful way however any further rate cuts might change that and trade tensions with china and the eu could be enough to convince the fed to pull the trigger again over the coming months the us dollar has been undermined by building expectations for looser us monetary policy and liquidity conditions says lee hardman a currency analyst at mufg heavy demand for year end funding is boosting the size of the fed s balance and the additional us dollar liquidity could increase downward pressure on the us dollar once year end demand eases chairman jerome powell has recently and repeatedly said the economy and interest rates are in a good place and that it d take a material reassessment of the outlook to change that view his comments were interpreted at the time as meaning another rate cut could be quite some way off the current federal funds rate range is between 1 5 and 1 75 above pound to dollar rate shown at daily intervals there s no doubt that the dollar is overvalued at these levels on almost any calculation but that s to be expected when the us economy is doing well against its peers it s also to be expected when the president is trying to re write trade deals with his country s biggest economic partners to the us advantage but as the us economy slows the overvaluation becomes not just more politically sensitive but also more unsustainable dxy is nearly 20 overvalued and the president is unhappy says kit juckes chief fx strategist at societe generale tuesday s weakness in the greenback has now got the pound to dollar rate testing the 1 30 level resistance barrier on the charts which has barred the british currency s path higher on repeated occasions in recent weeks technical analysts are commerzbank said tuesday the exchange rate is in an uptrend that could take it as far as 1 3187 over the coming weeks but that the british currency will struggle to get above that level fundamental analysts meanwhile are taking their cues from changes in polls of voting intentions ahead of the december 12 general election the conservative party poll lead shrank last week as support for the governing part ebbed and public enthusiasm for the opposition labour party was said to have increased in the wake of its manifesto launch which saw the latter promise various free public services in an effort to entice votes for gbp signs that the tory party could be losing its advantage is a negative factor this can largely be attributed to far left policies of the labour party and related concerns about re nationalisation and budgetary prudence says jane foley a senior strategist at rabobank while it is widely hoped that the december 12 election will draw a line under political uncertainty in the uk there is plenty of scope for this to be ongoing in the new year consequently it may be another bumpy ride for the pound foley and the rabobank team say pound sterling should be trading around the 1 35 level against the u s dollar in 12 months time but that the exchange rate would likely fall to 1 15 in the event of a no deal brexit others have made similar forecasts in regards to the december election with many analysts looking for a conservative victory to give the pound dollar rate a shot at the 1 35 level while some look for a labour party victory to push sterling all the way down to 1 15 currency markets favour a conservative government a part of the bias comes from a desire among investors to negate the threat of a no deal brexit and also see the economy move on from the current stage of negotiations which has paralysed the bank of england and some businesses while the rest is centred on fears about the opposition s economic agenda

at our 2018 investor day we also delivered an all time low efficiency ratio of 41 8 while continuing to invest in our future reflecting cost discipline overall i m extremely pleased with the segment s continued momentum and the fact that we re earning market leading client loyalty scores this year we added an additional cad50 billion of volumes to our market leading franchises reaping the benefits of our significant multi year investments in both sales power and innovative digital capabilities we added over 200 investment advisors and mortgage specialists in canadian banking over the last year but our strategy is more than just adding capacity it s also about having the right talent and capabilities to deliver differentiated advice products and experiences across our channels backed by the

are new to rbc our digital channel has now over 7 million active users and our mobile banking user base is up 16 year over year to nearly 4 5 million across all key product categories we continue to be a market leader with either a number one or number two market share in canada our credit card business saw growth across both spend and lend revenue streams with card balances and purchase volumes up 6 and 7 year over year respectively our relationship with petro canada continues to drive new clients to rbc while also delivering fuel savings for rbc card holders at any of petro canada s 1 500 retail locations nationwide with rbc ventures we continue to move beyond banking with a focus on engaging clients in new and innovative ways to date we have accumulated 3 2 million connections with canadians across our portfolio of ventures including those we ve both built and acquired we now have 17 ventures in market and another 14 under development one of these is movesnap a digital concierge

mortgage specialists saw this as an important addition to rbc s existing competitive advantage we plan to scale this venture nationally in 2020 ampli our new loyalty program which launched in july of this year already has active participation from over 40 leading brands and we are seeing good early signs of client engagement we re excited about the possibilities and we will be scaling up this venture as well in 2020 in business banking our strong results are driven by a focus on high return sectors that align with our risk framework they also reflect the benefit of multi year investments we ve made in talent and cash management solutions and increasingly in unique digital capabilities for example with the launch of rbc insight edge an industry first our canadian business clients can

build on its leading market share in canada adding cad8 billion of retail net sales this year alone in these uncertain times our clients are trusting us with more of their business following our advice service and capabilities illustrating this rbc gam was recognized for investment excellence in the 2019 canada lipper fund awards winning seven individual fund awards with ph n winning two

digital capabilities we offer through our team of nearly 1 900 advisors in canada our us wealth management business generated pre tax earnings of cad1 billion this year our us private client group is the sixth largest in the us by aua and had a record year for advisor recruitment attracting a number of experienced advisors from large wirehouses across the industry our momentum also continued at city national with double digit growth in both commercial lending and jumbo mortgages offsetting some of the industrywide margin pressure this year city national expanded further into our core markets of los angeles new york san francisco and washington dc we are upgrading our treasury management systems and technology to streamline the onboarding of new clients this along with our recent acquisitions of exactuals and filmtrack are important steps in continuing to grow our us deposit base our insurance business had a strong year with earnings of over cad800 million our second highest year on record we continue to develop innovative solutions to serve our 5 million insurance clients including a digital tool to simplify the application process for our term life insurance offering this segment continues to generate a high roe while serving a diverse client base including being a market leader in individual disability insurance moving to investor and treasury services as we ve highlighted in our prior quarters it s been a challenging environment and this quarter we took steps to reposition the business this journey is not easy as part of this process this quarter we made the difficult decision to reduce roles in europe and reduce our footprint in australia looking ahead we remain focused on key markets where we can provide the most value to our clients or returns are most attractive this includes canada which continues to provide a diversified source of deposits turning to capital markets against the challenging market backdrop we generated over cad2 6 billion of earnings this year corporate investment banking was impacted by an industrywide decline in fee pools as some client stayed on the sidelines given ongoing economic uncertainty our results were further impacted by delays in the completion of deals in our pipeline within this context i m proud of our team s continued continue to be awarded some significant mandates including as lead financial advisor to blackstone on its recently announced cad6 billion cross border acquisition of dream global this and other recently announced deals highlight the strength of our franchise and add to our healthy pipeline heading into 2020 in global markets our client centric model drove robust results and our fixed income business performed well despite an unfavorable market environment before moving to the outlook i want to touch on the macro environment in north america our core markets continue to be supported by healthy us consumer and their spending and a resilient canadian household sector both backed by strong labor markets and low interest rates the canadian housing market has also stabilized in business investment intentions remain healthy in canada including spending to expand the workforce and update technology to support higher demand as we look out to 2020 while we still see strength in our core markets there is no question it s expected to be a challenging macro environment uncertainty is weighing on both global growth and trade and was a key factor in the recent fed rate cuts bank of canada is balancing solid economic growth against elevated external risks leaving the door open for an interest rate cut in 2020 and based on what we re seeing today the next couple of years are likely to be challenging given interest rate trends uncertainty around global growth trade tensions and normalized credit conditions among other factors with this backdrop we are maintaining our medium term objectives recognizing that our performance relative to these objectives will be largely dependent on the macro environment we believe we are well positioned to meet our medium term objectives around roe capital strength and dividend payouts while meeting our 7 plus diluted eps growth objective may be challenging in the near term we are focused on meeting this target in the medium term as we ve done in recent years within this context we remain well positioned to continue driving strong market share gains in our leading client franchises and the power of our leading scale balance sheet strength and diverse revenue streams will allow us to continue investing in technology and sales capacity in this period of secular change we will maintain a disciplined approach to balancing near term operating leverage while creating long term sustainable value for our clients and shareholders we also maintain a consistent and prudent approach to risk management through the cycle so to sum up we enter 2020 with strong momentum in all our canadian retail franchises driven by multi year investments in our people products and technology we believe our focused growth strategy positions us well to continue to deliver an exceptional client experience gain market share and return capital to our shareholders to close i m proud of what we ve achieved this year and i want to take this opportunity to thank all 85 000 colleagues across the bank it s our talented and engaged employees who give back to communities and deliver leading advice and service to our clients and with that i ll turn the call over to rod rod bolger chief financial officer thanks dave and good morning everyone starting on slide 7 against the challenging macroeconomic backdrop we delivered solid fourth quarter earnings of cad3 2 billion down 1 year over year diluted eps of cad2 18 was down 1 as well for the last two quarters i ve given an update on our cost management progress and i ll do so again this quarter we are focused on driving efficiencies so that we can continue to invest in future growth during this prolonged low interest rate environment this quarter expense growth was 7 4 year over year or 4 4 on an adjusted basis over 40 of the increase was in client facing roles as well as technology and digital initiatives as we invested in serving clients and continued business growth indicative of our expense discipline expense growth in the second half of 2019 slowed to 3 4 on an adjusted basis as compared to 6 6 in the first half of the year in other words the growth rate was cut nearly in half looking forward to 2020 we expect to continue to slow expense growth by leveraging our scale while continuing to strategically grow our client base and deepen client relationships turning to slide 8 our cet1 ratio of 12 1 was up 20 basis points quarter over quarter strong internal capital generation was partly offset by organic rwa growth and share buybacks this quarter we bought back 4 5 million shares for a total of cad474 million that puts us at 10 3 million shares repurchased for the year for cad1 billion moving to our business segments on slide 9 personal and commercial banking reported earnings of cad1 6 billion this quarter up 5 year over year canadian banking net income of cad1 6 billion was up 6 year over year we continued to see strong volume growth of 8 year over year across our core products this quarter residential mortgages grew at more than 7 year over year driven by strong double digit mortgage origination volume growth and strong retention results business loan growth was up nearly 10 year over year slightly lower than the growth achieved over the last nine quarters deposit growth was strong across both personal and business deposits in particular we continued to see strong growth of 14 in personal gics as clients continue to shift toward deposits in response to macroeconomic uncertainty our net interest margin of 2 76 was down 4 basis points from last quarter due to the impact of competitive pricing pressures looking forward to 2020 we expect nim to drop approximately 4 to 6 basis points for the year given current competitive mortgage pricing expense growth was nominal for the quarter due to strong cost management and our ability to leverage scale as a driver of efficiency operating leverage in canadian banking was 4 3 for the quarter and 2 for the year within our previous guidance of 2 to 3 range for the year looking forward to 2020 we expect operating leverage to be 1 to 2 given the impact of interchange and expectations for sustained low interest rate environment our historical operating leverage trends can be seen on slide 22 turning to slide 10 wealth management reported earnings of cad729 million which were up 32 year over year adjusting for the gain on sale of bluebay s private debt business earnings were up 8 year over year global asset management revenues were up 39 year over year and excluding the gain revenues were up 10 this was largely due to higher fee based revenue and higher aum driven by market appreciation and net sales in canada global asset management increased its retail mutual fund industry market share by 70 basis points year over year to 15 8 as of september canadian wealth management revenues were up 3 year over year driven by higher fee based assets market appreciation and net sales over the course of the year including in q4 we continued to add investment advisors to deliver more advice and insights to our clients our non us wealth management s efficiency ratio was 60 8 adjusting for the gain our efficiency ratio was 66 5 which improved 220 basis points year over year in us wealth management revenues were up 14 year over year in us dollars driven by 19 loan growth at city national and record fee based asset growth at our us private client group despite the declining interest rate environment in the us in the latter part of 2019 city national continued to generate solid growth in net interest income up 8 year over year deposit growth in q4 was up 14 year over year reflecting funding benefits from higher sweep deposits as well as accelerating growth in business deposits this quarter we saw net interest margin decline 29 basis points quarter over quarter to 3 14 excluding the 8 basis point gain on recoveries from legacy loans last quarter nim was down 21 basis points looking forward to 2020 we expect nim to decline in the first quarter albeit at a slower rate reflecting the full quarter impact of the september and october us rate cuts as well as the impact from the implementation of ifrs 16 absent any further us rate cuts in 2020 and increasing competitive pressure on deposit pricing we expect margins to tick lower before stabilizing in the latter half of 2020 moving to insurance on slide 11 net income of cad282 million was down 11 from last year primarily due to lower favorable reinsurance contract renegotiations and less favorable annual actuarial assumption updates higher claims costs and lower favorable investment related expense also contributed to the decrease these factors were partially offset by the impact of new longevity reinsurance contracts from 2016 to 2018 approximately 60 of insurance earnings were recorded in the second half of the year in 2019 the percentage earned in the second half of the year was also 60 but with a higher proportion earned in q3 moving to investor and treasury services on slide 12 net income was cad45 million as dave mentioned earlier we are committed to improving the profitability of i ts and as such recognized cad83 million after tax in repositioning costs in q4 associated with repositioning this business excluding this charge net income was cad128 million down 17 year over year i ts was impacted by lower funding and liquidity revenue primarily driven by the short term interest rate environment and lower gains from the disposition of certain securities we also saw a lower asset services revenue due to reduced client activity and lower client deposit revenue largely driven by margin compression on slide 13 capital markets earnings of cad584 million were down 12 year over year corporate and investment banking revenues were down 14 primarily due to lower m a activity across all regions this quarter saw investment banking fee pools decrease 13 year over year across most products with m a down 21 year over year despite a challenging quarter across the industry we rose to 10th in the global league table for fiscal 2019 up from 11th in the prior year global markets revenues were up 6 despite the challenging market environment we saw solid fixed income trading which was partially offset by lower equity trading revenues overall our trading businesses performed well against our peers on a year to date basis given our diversified geographic and product mix looking ahead to 2020 our investment banking pipeline remains strong with the timing of several large deals expected to close in the first quarter 2020 in conclusion we are pleased with the resiliency of our franchise to manage through the challenging environment our core retail franchises continued to grow in q4 offsetting market and wholesale industry challenges and macroeconomic headwinds our results reflect the strength of our diversified business model and commitment to long term value creation for our stakeholders and with that i ll turn it over to graeme graeme hepworth chief risk officer thank you rod and good morning everyone starting on slide 16 this quarter we had provisions on impaired loans of cad434 million which equated to 27 basis points additionally we established provisions on performing loans of cad71 million or 5 basis points for a total of cad505 million or 32 basis points provisions on performing loans increased by cad41 million or 3 basis points from last quarter unfavorable changes in our overall portfolio mix including seasonal factors related to our cards portfolio and credit migrations contributed to the quarter over quarter increase these factors were partially offset by a more favorable macroeconomic forecast in areas such as canadian housing and the impact of model changes for a few of our retail portfolios provisions on impaired loans increased by cad35 million or 2 basis points from last quarter mainly due to higher provisions in canadian banking and city national which were partly offset by lower provisions in caribbean banking for fiscal year 2019 pcl on loans totaled 31 basis points up 8 basis points from last year provisions on impaired loans totaled 27 basis points up 7 basis points from last year which represented a shift from the cyclical lows of 2017 and 2018 to more normalized levels this year let me now provide some additional detail on three of our businesses in canadian banking pcl on loans of cad400 million increased by 5 basis points from last quarter about half of the increase was due to provisions on performing loans related to the factors already noted the remaining increase is a result of higher provisions on impaired loans primarily attributable to our cards and personal lending portfolios in wealth management pcl on loans of cad34 million increased by cad7 million from last quarter mainly due to a new impaired loan in the consumer discretionary sector in the us this sector has been the largest source of loan losses for city national bank in 2019 largely in relation to the quick serve restaurant industry where clients are being impacted by rising labor and capital costs notwithstanding higher provisions at our city national portfolio in fiscal 2019 it continues to perform ahead of our expectations in capital markets pcl on loans of cad78 million increased by cad22 million from last quarter mostly due to higher provisions on performing loans reflecting downgrades in our oil and gas portfolio provisions on impaired loans were up cad7 million from last quarter this reflects ongoing weakness in the oil and gas sector as well as provisions in a few other sectors turning to slide 17 gross impaired loans of cad3 billion were relatively stable from last quarter as higher new impairments in canadian banking were mainly offset by higher repayments in caribbean banking as well as repayments and loan sales in capital markets overall we saw a decrease in new formations in our capital markets portfolios even though we continued to see heightened levels of formations in the oil and gas sector this quarter we remain comfortable with our exposure to the oil and gas sector which represents about 1 of our total loans this portfolio is governed by borrowing bases and size of the proven reserves of the borrowers which provide good protection against credit losses looking at our retail portfolio on slide 19 we saw an increase in insolvencies primarily in the form of consumer proposals in our personal lending and cards portfolios prior year s interest rate increases have impacted some of our clients by raising debt servicing costs notwithstanding the overall strong labor markets and income growth this past year we also saw an increase in delinquencies and insolvencies in our cards portfolio in quebec this increase follows the implementation of a new rule on minimum credit card payments which took effect in the province last august while these factors contributed to a moderate increase in pcl this quarter in our unsecured retail portfolios the overall credit profile of our retail clients remain strong with stable levels of delinquencies high fico scores and low ltvs looking at fiscal 2020 we would expect provisions on impaired loans to be in the range of 25 to 30 basis points and provisions on performing loans to be in the range of 3 to 5 basis points should credit conditions continue to normalize as we ve cautioned in past years there will be inherent volatility from one quarter to the next particularly for our wholesale portfolios where provisions tend to be more concentrated we also expect some degree of volatility in our provisions on performing loans based on volume growth changes in macroeconomic variables and portfolio mix to conclude we maintain our prudent risk management approach and are closely monitoring the macroeconomic environment we are confident that our credit performance will remain resilient throughout the credit cycle given the strength of our underwriting standards the diversification of our portfolio and the quality of our client base with that operator let s open the lines for q a questions and answers operator thank you the first question is from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning i had just a two part question on expenses i guess rod you mentioned expenses should taper a little relative to the 3 5 growth we saw in the back half of 19 i guess does that imply something like a 2 to 3 expense growth expectation for 2020 all else equal and just taking a step back and just listening to dave in terms of his cautious outlook on the revenue environment is there anything bigger that the bank needs to do in terms of flexing the expense lever more as we think about 2020 and beyond rod bolger chief financial officer thanks ebrahim yeah on the expenses recall that we have a large wealth management business and capital markets business so as revenue ramps up or down we have a natural hedge on expenses so if the first quarter ends up being strong for capital markets and or wealth management you might see expense growth tick up a little bit or if it s weaker as it did in the second half of the year as it came down a little bit versus the growth in the first half of the year expenses will be a little bit lower so it does moderate we re taking the core rate of expenses down in terms of the growth rate and you ll see that in a number of the line items if you look in our supplement our marketing costs and travel costs things like that we have taken the rate of growth of that down and our technology investment we have been growing that over the last five years significantly and over the last year or so and we expect to continue to take that rate of growth down and so given the macroeconomic environment largely the interest rate environment now which had been providing us tailwinds for two plus years enabling us to invest in future growth invest in continued market share now we have a lot of the pieces in place both from a technology standpoint and a talent standpoint and distribution standpoint to continue to grow revenue despite those macroeconomic uncertainties and expenses toggle down a little bit with it so the guidance that i gave that we expect to continue to see it to moderate would hold and we d expect to see low single digits ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst and we shouldn t be expecting any bigger actions on expenses like the restructuring you did i know it was specific to the investor and treasury business but anything much larger or something that should investors anticipate something like that over the course of the next year or so david mckay president chief executive officer ebrahim it s dave and what i d like to reinforce is we continue to look at our cost structure and we re managing it the same way across the organization we have over the last five or six years which is trying to get ahead of our cost structure invest in technology manage through various levers over time and bring our base down so we don t forecast i mean it take an aggressive short term repositioning because we are trying to get ahead of things we have a number of programs across the organizations we saw this coming so i think you can expect from us generally a continued management of costs programmatically across the organization so that s how we see the world right now having said that we did take a short term repositioning of investor services because we had to make a quick pivot a quick pivot from europe into asia in a number of roles in there and adjust our cost base more quickly given the things that we re trying to do in the business so that came at us quite quickly and i d say that was more out of the ordinary for how we manage our cost structure than typical of what you ve seen us do in the past so the core message is continue to expect us to manage our base down programmatically across the organization the way we ve done in the past ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s very helpful thank you both operator thank you and the next question is from gabriel dechaine with national bank financial please go ahead gabriel dechaine national bank financial inc analyst good morning i want to ask graeme about your outlook for 2020 on the pcl loss range i don t i didn t come across that in your materials but you were a smidge above your target range for this year i know there were some idiosyncratic losses early in the year but on the other hand maybe some seasoning effect in the cards portfolio capital markets seems to be in an upswing there for pcls balance the factors where do you see the ratio lining up in 2020 graeme hepworth chief risk officer yeah i think as i made in my comments we re forecasting the ratio in that stage three to be 25 to 30 basis points into the stage three side of it and an additional 3 to 5 basis points in stage one and two i think some of your observations and the comments i made all factor into that as you referenced certainly in the first half of the year we saw some very idiosyncratic events in our wholesale portfolios particularly in both capital markets and in commercial and canadian banking i mean the latter half of the year i would say it s been a bit it s been a bit more broad based but a bit more what we would view as more normal and so when you look at longer term trends in retail at around 34 basis points and in wholesale around 31 basis points we still feel we re certainly coming off two very strong years from a pcl perspective in 2017 and 18 where looking at the wholesale things i would say they were abnormally low but we re still i would say below long term averages but acceptable levels and levels that don t concern us gabriel dechaine national bank financial inc analyst you also mentioned in the cards and personal loans as drivers the seasonality and i always thought of that as more of a q4 thing and on the quebec regulatory change there for making minimum payments and that s like a five year phase in so i m a bit surprised to hear that s already having an impact we are seeing insolvency data moving higher across canada and just wondering is that where you see the most pressure coming in next year in terms of normalization or seasoning in that portfolio graeme hepworth chief risk officer well i d say normalization is not specific to retail again as i highlighted in wholesale 2017 and 18 were quite exceptional years they would be more abnormal than what 2019 was so on wholesale again i think we can you can expect to see a continuation of what we saw in the latter half of 19 retail has continued at very low levels we expect to see that tick up moderately but overall there ll be some puts and takes there that give us comfort to that overall 25 to 30 basis point range retail more specifically yes we ve seen some factors i don t want to overstate the factors we ve seen in card i was just trying to highlight what we are seeing there cards overall this year was up 12 year on year about half of that is related to growth a portion of that i would attribute to weakness in alberta and then the insolvency factor that i highlighted but overall in retail outside those factors we continue to see very stable delinquency profiles our origination quality continues to be very strong so again we feel quite comfortable with the profile there but do reflect the fact that we re probably coming off some very strong years and we ll see it normalize to some degree gabriel dechaine national bank financial inc analyst thank you operator thank you the next question is from john aiken with barclays please go ahead john aiken barclays bank plc analyst good morning taking a look at your objective for us wealth management given the challenging year that we ve had as well as the margin compression that we ve seen in those operations what s the level of confidence in achieving the stated objective for 2020 as we sit here today david mckay president chief executive officer i think if you look at the progress we ve made in city national the real strength is we ve doubled the size of the core franchise over the past four or five years from a balance sheet perspective and continue to maintain double digit lending growth numbers throughout the cycle we dipped a bit on deposits but you ll see our deposit strength came back nicely in q4 to i think roughly 14 so our primary focus is to continue to invest in that core franchise expand geographically grow our mortgage and our commercial business and continue to expand our private banking business so from that perspective from a balance sheet growth perspective a client growth perspective we re at or a little bit ahead of our overall targets what we can t control in our forecast that we gave you when we did the presentation in 2016 was the level of interest rates so we made that forecast of where earnings where we had rates coming back and holding a bit longer than they ve held and we didn t forecast the quick reduction in rates in fed rate cuts that you ve seen over the past year so if rates continue to hold where they are and go lower it s going to be tough for us to generate enough margin off balance sheet growth which has exceeded our expectations to meet those targets so we are looking at slowing cost growth we re looking as i ve talked about in our recent investor conference we ve significantly ramped up our cost structure beyond where we thought we d be to try to meet the growth opportunities we saw in the marketplace if the us economy doesn t perform where it has potential you could see us pull back on some of that cost structure and deliver some earnings there so we ve got a number of levers but i think you should focus on the core franchise customer balance sheet growth has been significant it s double it s ahead of where we thought it was the margins are a bit off and we can t control that but the core franchise has performed exceptionally well john aiken barclays bank plc analyst thanks dave and as a bit of a follow on given what we re seeing on margins now i understand the overall profitability of the platform remains quite strong but as margins are under compression is there any discussion about slowing the growth that we ve seen over the past year david mckay president chief executive officer yeah i just referenced that as we ve talked about i m heading out to la tomorrow absolutely we ve accelerated our growth we ve opened in hudson yards we are opening other stores in new york we re opening in washington we can t slow some of the staffing of those stores but we can certainly slow our back office growth which ramped up for a significant growth and if the growth doesn t materialize but even having said that i think we ve kind of run up our back office growth quite aggressively and there is an opportunity to reduce it through technology investment but also just through kind of managing that cost structure down in a slower growth environment so we do foresee the ability to grow our earnings by managing our cost structure as another lever that we haven t pulled to date we ve allowed that cost structure to move ahead to grow because we have not made an acquisition and therefore we ve invested in organic growth where we get the highest returns so i think the answer is absolutely that s something that i m focused on and kelly coffey our ceo of city national is focused on so thanks for your question i think we ll take the next question operator thank you the next question is from meny grauman with cormark securities please go ahead meny grauman cormark securities inc analyst hi good morning rod in your commentary kind of you talked about i think it was 4 to 6 basis points of additional margin pressure given competitive dynamics just a clarification i assume that doesn t include any bank of canada rate cuts but i just wanted to see how that would change your outlook rod bolger chief financial officer yeah thanks meny that s correct i mean the market is not forecasting with high likelihood of a rate cut until potentially the end of next year so it wouldn t really have an impact certainly in the first three quarters and maybe marginally on the fourth quarter if it happens so a lot of that is really the stock and flow of the growth in the book and so i think it s important to step back and look at the strong volume growth 8 in q4 the strong net interest income growth which was 5 6 in q4 and over 7 for the year and so part of this is mix and the mortgage market has come back and there is continued reports on that we continue to grow share in that space those products tend to have a lower spread than other unsecured products and so as we grow that book as the market grows at higher level you re going to just see some mix issues cause that nim to come down and overall with good volumes it s still a positive and it s still a positive revenue story so part of this is a little bit of math when you look at the underlying rates versus five years ago so a lot of our deposits the tractoring and the internal transfer pricing on that it is positive interest rates the five year rate actually despite the low rate environment today is still higher than it was five years ago so structurally in the deposit side we re ok the mortgages is a competitive pricing element so there is nothing that is actually ominous in this outlook it s just a factor of what s the market is bringing us and our continued market share growth so i wouldn t look at that as a negative per se i think the business is quite strong meny grauman cormark securities inc analyst just as a follow up on that you highlight improved mortgage growth and i m just wondering your perspective on what s driving that and is there an element there that is concerning in terms of that reacceleration neil mclaughlin group head personal commercial banking it s neil i ll handle that one no definitely nothing concerning we would look at the strong mortgage performance in 2019 directly as a result of a review we did around some internal processes and just making sure that we were following up on better lead management following up on leads more quickly getting back to customers more quickly as well as some changes in our adjudication process that made sure that once we had a transaction in front of us we didn t lose that customers so graeme spoke to the underwriting which continues to be very strong and we would look at both house prices and home sales across the country being quite balanced and starting to stabilize after b 20 we have seen the fall have more activity and sort of the buying season a little bit elongated but as we look at it all around we would feel very comfortable with the performance of the mortgage business meny grauman cormark securities inc analyst thank you doug guzman group head rbc wealth management rbc insurance and rbc investor treasury services thank you well let s move on to the next question operator thank you and the next question is from steve theriault with eight capital please go ahead steve theriault eight capital analyst thanks very much if i could just start with a quick follow up rod last quarter you talked about 40 basis points of nim or thereabouts over five quarters given rate cut expectations maybe does that still hold and if so should we be thinking of the q4 impact of 29 basis points or the 21 basis points you mentioned on a more adjusted basis rod bolger chief financial officer thank you steve i assume you re talking about city national steve theriault eight capital analyst yes sorry city national yeah rod bolger chief financial officer yeah so i would think of in terms of 21 basis points that 8 basis points was a one time gain and we tried to call that out last quarter as well as this quarter not to build that in yes so we ended at kind of 3 14 i spoke to last quarter that if the fed was cutting which the fed ended up doing both in september and october that basically the fed funds rate was going to be back to levels that you had seen in 2017 ish which is when city national had spreads in the high 2s the 2 85 to 2 9 range and absent a big tick up in the five year rate which would help with some of the asset pricing and the tractors on the deposits you d expect the margins come into similar levels as what it was so on adjusted basis you are at 3 35 in q3 40 basis points would take you down to the 2 95 range i think you re within that range as i mentioned i think my message is we expect to continue downturn in q1 given the two fed cuts but then we see it leveling off and we see modest spread compression from there and that s what the markets are saying right now based on their expectations for fed activity but we ll see what happens with the trade discussions and tariffs and future fed activity one way or the other that would change the outlook for us steve theriault eight capital analyst okay that s helpful and then just lastly a question on investor and treasury services post the restructuring and repositioning can you talk about what can you offer up in terms of the earnings power going forward what type of bottom line benefit we ll see from that cad83 million of restructuring this quarter doug guzman group head rbc wealth management rbc insurance and rbc investor treasury services yeah it s doug couple of things one is the charge that we just took that is point to the effect of that as rod said in his statements is really going to be seen kind of leaking into the p l in terms of reduced expenses over the course of the year so as you get toward the back end of the year you ll see i think more improvement on the expense side in terms of the revenue side we have been struggling with a flattening yield curve with a short end and some margin compression we ve changed how the trading reports we ve put on some more term and the accrual book is producing more regularly right now and so we re just going to try to manage that and so on the revenue side we ll see what the market will give us on the investor services side we re just working away in terms of trying to do more business with customers and we ll see how it plays out david mckay president chief executive officer thanks steve we will move on to next question steve theriault eight capital analyst sure operator thank you the next question is from robert sedran with cibc capital markets please go ahead robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst hello good morning just want to follow up with neil on the mortgage question everything we hear is that mortgage spreads are at historic lows but when the market leader is growing at market leading rates it would suggest that this is something you re doing rather than something that is happening to you in terms of the competitive pressure so i understand all the process issues you talked about but i presume you re also not shying away from the price competition as well so is this just part of a client acquisition strategy or are you comfortable with the mortgage as a stand alone strategy that you can continue to grow at these rates as profitably as you d like to neil mclaughlin group head personal commercial banking yeah thanks for the question i mean our strategy is not obviously to lead the market down in terms of price i think we re leading with advice and we re leading with distribution so dave mentioned in his commentary we added mortgage specialists and my comments were more about the productivity of those mortgage specialists in terms of making sure they got back to customers more quickly making sure they got better leads and they can access those leads so reality is we do participate in the market we don t have as much influence as i think some feel in terms of setting the price that said we are not going to have other customers come in and put a mortgage into our customers hands when we feel it should be with us so we re going to remain competitive on price absolutely agree with your comments in terms of the level competitiveness and spreads and i think there s just a lot of competition out there and especially in the last half of this year robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst so given all that above average market growth is still what you d expect graeme hepworth chief risk officer we re maintaining kind of that we re mid single digits and that s still really our target range robert sedran cibc capital markets analyst okay thank you operator thank you the next question is from sumit malhotra with scotia capital please go ahead sumit malhotra scotiabank global banking analyst thanks good morning for dave we ve spoken many times about how the stars really aligned for the bank and the timing of the purchase of city national a lot of questions on this call about the interest rate environment and the growth of that business if it s affecting your franchise it s obviously affecting your competitors as well especially with your capital ratio one of the stronger aspects of the quarter sitting something like 11 8 11 9 on a pro forma basis does the acquisition or external capital deployment supplementing that business become more attractive given what s happening to some of your competitors in this rate backdrop than it has been in the last few years or you content to hold capital and continue to buy back a larger amount of stock david mckay president chief executive officer it s a great question i would say certainly leaning toward the latter than the former and that s we re going to continue to grow organically you ve seen the double digit mid 14 15 16 loan growth 14 deposit growth we re investing in new branches investing in expanded sales force capability launching new products building our brand in the us so the organic build we ve invested heavily with and we continue to focus on that because that drives the highest roes for our shareholders now being patient and waiting has paid off already and i think it s going to pay off even more to continue to be patient and watch the us marketplace as we watch the economy and we watch valuation of banks and we re being very careful we would only look at something that grow a strong shareholder return grow our franchise geographically or grow our product capability and enhance the existing strong growth rate that we have right now and doesn t overly distract management with something that s too small so i think those are the same parameters we ve talked about organic growth first and with our strong cet1 ratios it gives us an opportunity to return capital to shareholders while meeting all our organic growth objectives across all our businesses so we sit in a very strong position to continue to create relative total shareholder return for our investors sumit malhotra scotiabank global banking analyst that s very clear thanks for that and then lastly for rod bolger we ve talked a lot this year on these calls about the declining trend in the tax rate in the capital markets segment and it took another significant step down this quarter is there anything i know there is some competitive factors at play here rod so i d appreciate any insight you could give us as to what exactly has driven the tax rate down to something like 3 this quarter and are there any risk to the bank in terms of an impact on revenue or normalization in this line in 2020 for how we think about earnings for that unit rod bolger chief financial officer yeah thanks for that sumit i wouldn t call it a risk to the bank i would expect it to normalize a bit and be back into double digits in 2020 you saw some updated guidance out of the us even this week on the beat tax for example and i think they re coming out with more guidance so there is a natural upward bias on the tax rate i think globally as countries try to capture more of a tax base especially and banks fall into that even when they re going after technology companies but also there is an ebb and flow to this as the earnings were a bit off in q4 in capital markets the geographic mix ends up being favorable oftentimes from a tax perspective and so as earnings normalize going forward and increase as we highlighted with the strong backlog and strong pipeline i would expect that the geographic mix would be less favorable from a tax perspective than it was this quarter so as a result all indications are that we would be back toward a more normalized double digit tax rate in this business in 2020 sumit malhotra scotiabank global banking analyst thanks for your time and doug mcgregor i think this is your final call thanks for your help over the years doug mcgregor group head investor treasury services thank you thanks for that comment next question operator thank you the next question is from doug young with desjardins capital markets please go ahead doug young desjardins securities inc analyst hi good morning most of my questions have been asked and answered but one i wanted to go back to because i think you addressed the adding 2 5 million new clients by fiscal 23 for canadian banking but i think at the investor day you also threw out a target for rbc ventures of adding 5 million active users and converting 10 to royal bank clients i m hoping just to get a bit of color on how that transition is going because i think you added i think you mentioned 3 2 million connections but looking at that conversion to canadian bank clients just wanted some color on that thank you david mckay president chief executive officer thanks doug for your question i ll start with the overall ventures targets and neil will talk about the bigger impact of 2 5 million net new clients of which we said 500 000 conversions would come from ventures now we re a couple of years into this now and we ve really focused on building those 5 million new connections that you would have had to buy in a social media or digital channel but for now we have a connection to a new canadian potential client that we never had before and they ve come through those 17 ventures so we ve really made that the primary focus and we actually haven t tried to convert them to rbc product holders as yet we re trying to build deeper relationships trying to get to know them and that s going to pay off over the long term having said that 2020 is a big scaling year where we are going to start the conversion process through a number of these ventures i gave the example of movesnap which we embedded into our overall mortgage process our mortgage sales force of over 600 specialists said it was one of the biggest tools they had to help close mortgages in a price competitive marketplace as you referenced i would say though that rbc did try we did increase our mortgage rates over the past year given the volatility i think twice right neil and you can comment on that further but having said that we re competing primarily on creating value for our customers and movesnap came into that fray we have another five or six ventures in the mortgage space that s creating value that we re ready to scale nationally so i think we ve focused on 3 2 million we re already 65 toward our 5 million target after a year and a half to two years so we feel that we ll likely exceed the 5 million but the conversion proof is going to come over the coming quarters and we re very much focused on scaling ampli i think when you can add 40 retailers over a two year period and if you look at what it took air miles add retailers over a decade the fact that we have a team now of high profile brands creating value for canadians you re going to see us scale that aggressively in 2020 and convert off of that so i think we re really positioned well to start to show you some numbers on the bank conversion side which is still not insignificant i think we ve done over 50 000 conversions just in pilot phase without any real marketing spend behind it we ve already factored marketing budgets in to scale this internationally so i think that is kind of a little more color on ventures i ll turn it to neil to talk about the overall client acquisition and how we re building on the 300 000 over the past each year over the past two years neil mclaughlin group head personal commercial banking yeah so thanks for the question i think the ventures we d say is where we is on plan it s where we wanted it to be dave talked about the first fly we needed to make is they actually get the client engagement and so that s the first sort of the first milestone is to engage customers that we didn t have a relationship before have them coming back to these digital experiences and we ve also been very cautious about managing what is referred to as kind of the load factor how many times we want to put the rbc brand or an rbc value proposition in front of them is something we re really testing we don t want to limit that engagement we re having and you ve seen that s another digital business model i think in terms of we have seen some of the ventures for example owner which is focused at the venture focused at new small business originations we re seeing a very good conversion rate there small business owners can go into the app they can register the small business they re immediately offered a small business banking package and we re seeing upwards of 40 conversion rate on that venture things like the drive venture we ve actually integrated that into our mobile app they ve talked about the number of customers we have logging into the mobile app multiple times a month so we re able to give exposure to the value proposition there movesnap was one of the offers we put out to our customers this summer it proved to be actually as or more valuable than some of the more traditional offers like for example just the cash incentive so we re feeling that three good examples already providing value in terms of ampli dave mentioned the relationship with the merchants we really look at this as key part of it to have the quality of the merchants so right now in the ampli app we have merchants like home depot and rexall westjet the keg indigo and so the key there is that we ve got these relationships with merchants they re willing to put value on the table for our clients and again it s that virtuous circle of providing getting the engagement providing the value and then us testing into how we drive the conversion so that s really how we re thinking about it david mckay president chief executive officer okay and we should move on to the next question thanks we have i know we re almost at time but we ll try to get a couple more in operator thank you the next question is from sohrab movahedi with bmo capital markets please go ahead sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst i just wanted to kind of go back to that new client stuff neil 300 000 you say i think you ve added this year 300 000 and last year the 2 5 million target can you just i know we re short on time but can you give us a sense of how that is translating into your segment s results and whether or not you are actually having to still provide incentives whether it s ipads or cash to pick up some of these customers neil mclaughlin group head personal commercial banking yeah so thanks for the question so the new client acquisition those are both step ups from where we d be running with net new client acquisition in the previous three years so we re feeling that we re on the trajectory we set out to your point incentives still are part of the strategy we were out again with the ipad campaign as we do the analytics those are well performing solid returning investments you will see us on a go forward basis there will be a mix there ll be some new value propositions that we feel can really start to drive an increase in the trajectory and we ll look for that in the back half of the year but right now we re pleased with our new client results and we re also seeing in terms of just the core checking account service fees we were actually one of the drivers of other income so we are seeing it pull through on that line sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst i appreciate that thank you doug guzman group head rbc wealth management rbc insurance and rbc investor treasury services thanks sohrab we ll take one more operator thank you and the last question will be from scott chan with canaccord genuity please go ahead scott chan canaccord genuity corp analyst good morning just quickly on the oil and gas portfolio maybe just a two part question just on the credit you cited was that us or canada and the second part just in terms of the strong growth i know it s a modest part of your portfolio but i think it was up 30 year over year is that kind of like a comfortable growth trajectory with that book going forward thank you graeme hepworth chief risk officer sure thanks for the question it s graeme i ll probably a little bit more commentary on the oil and gas our oil and gas portfolio was about 70 canada and 30 other if you will the other being mostly the us of that portfolio about three quarters would be exploration and production the mix between investment grade and non investment grade would be roughly i think 23 investment grade remaining non investment grade in terms of the growth that s happened there just how that s in terms of credit quality the growth over the last year that we ve seen i would say has been more balanced to investment grade non investment grade roughly about 50 50 there so we ve actually seen the portfolio quality skew up a little bit over the last year the non investment grade piece as i mentioned in my remarks is certainly the credit risk we really mitigate through a really high quality structure the borrowing base structure so that even though we see impairments in that sector as our clients struggle with some of the headwinds there the amount of loan losses accrued to us have been relatively moderate i think our loan losses over the last five years they have been around just over 100 basis points despite the real difficulties that sector is facing so that would be just a kind of quick summary on the credit profile there i don t know if doug or derek wanted to comment on what s driving the growth derek neldner ceo and group head rbc capital markets all right it s derek i ll maybe comment just briefly i think as graeme said i think the growth we feel quite comfortable with it s been an even balance between investment grade names and some borrowing base names that would all be conforming part of the growth was driven by a couple of larger investment grade m a related transactions that came on to the books and so we think overall it s quite a comfortable risk profile scott chan canaccord genuity corp analyst great thank you very much david mckay president chief executive officer thanks scott and before i end the call i would like to recognize two of our leaders who are retiring shortly jennifer tory who is our current chief administrative officer for her illustrious 42 year career at rbc which includes roles as you know as group head of p cb and as i said most recently as our chief administrative officer we d like to sincerely thank her for her contribution over her career and we ll certainly miss her and as i ve already acknowledged on the call doug

a rift between the united states and china could have far reaching consequences for the world economy getty the idea of a decoupling between the united states and china started gathering steam earlier this year as the trade war between the two countries intensified and negotiators on both sides repeatedly failed to reach a solution in theory decoupling would mean ripping up global supply chains freezing foreign investment initiatives and burning down the geopolitical bridges that were built over the past four decades between washington and beijing decoupling has reportedly been put forward by china hawks in the trump administration including president trump s trade advisor peter navarro chinese officials along with an army of economists and businesspeople of various nationalities have warned that such a separation would harm both chinese and us companies roil financial markets and endanger global trade some experts have likened decoupling to separating conjoined twins who share the same internal organs it s going to be very messy very difficult says diana choyleva chief economist at enodo economics a london based consultancy it would mean cost push inflation it would mean the slowing down of innovation and technological progress it would mean that each economy trying to solve the issues of increased inequality will find it that much harder to do so while the complete separation of the world s two largest economies is deemed unlikely more subtle shifts have already started to take hold in china affluent families startups tech companies and foreign businesses are being led by the government to make choices that exclude the u s with potentially far reaching consequences for global trade four emerging trends in investment supply chain regionalization technology and education reflect changes that have been set in motion in china in recent months and are expected to develop in 2020 investment plunging or being redirected perhaps the most striking effect of the trade war is the drop in foreign direct investment into the u s particularly from china from 2016 to 2018 chinese investment into the u s plummeted by almost 88 to 5 4 billion and is expected to dry up further this year meanwhile foreign direct investment from the u s into china jumped 65 6 per cent in yuan denominated terms in the first quarter of 2019 despite the trade war according to the chinese commerce ministry in the first nine months of the year total foreign direct investment into china grew 2 9 compared with the same period last year to 100 8 billion this reflected a slowdown from previous years foreign direct investment into china had grown 3 in 2018 5 in 2017 and 7 in 2016 global investment and trade in general have slowed due to the uncertainty created by the trade war uncertainty is the worst enemy of growth said angel gurria secretary general of the oecd during a visit to beijing last month but in china excluding the u s from new investments and redirecting funds elsewhere has become the norm among various levels of government and state owned firms law yee ping a tech consultant in the southern metropolis of shenzhen was managing a planned china u s startup incubator but after the trade war intensified earlier this year the city of shenzhen shut down funding for the project law repurposed the space to host china russia startups instead you shut the door on us so we opened another small door law says referring to the u s you are pushing us to go go go regionalization of supply chains experts say the trade war has also accelerated the trend of increased regionalization of supply chains noel quinn group ceo of hsbc said at a business forum hosted in november by bloomberg in beijing that 97 of companies surveyed recently by hsbc were looking at changing their supply chains more and more companies in china and asia want to serve customers from nearby markets especially as the purchasing power in many asian nations is rising a caveat is that while product supply chains are indeed becoming more regional improving certain efficiencies and reducing the environmental impact of trade in the process services are becoming hyperglobalized with trans continental data flows increasing in value says parag khanna managing partner of singapore based consultancy futuremap china is doing its part to boost trade with asian and european nations by promoting free trade agreements beijing scored a victory in november when 15 asia pacific nations signaled they planned to sign a sweeping free trade agreement in 2020 beijing and brussels are also planning to finalize a eu china investment agreement next year that is meant to boost both investment and trade what you get with decoupling is simply a shifting of the couplings khanna said money doesn t disappear it gets realigned artificial intelligence race technology usa china getty the start of a tech war another aspect of decoupling is the possible drawing of a technological iron curtain between the east and the west this idea became popular after the u s in may restricted chinese tech giant huawei from buying components and software from u s firms and started pressuring european allies against hiring huawei to build their 5g network infrastructure citing security concerns vincent peng huawei s president for western europe told me earlier this year that even though huawei has built its own operating system for smartphones to replace google s android which huawei has used for years the company wanted to postpone rolling it out for as long as possible a global split in technological standards in telecom would be a disaster for the world economy peng said now experts are talking about an all out tech war between the u s and china with potentially dangerous outcomes yahoo co founder jerry yang at the bloomberg forum warned of unintended consequences that can occur when washington and beijing back away from the collaborative nature of their relationship from the past three decades i think the core of innovation is being very severely challenged by the current trend yang said we re in danger of going back to the dark ages if we do not standardize if we do fracture into little pockets of markets that really don t sustain themselves chinese students turning away from us universities another consequence of the trade war is the expected drop in the number of chinese undergraduate and graduate students in the u s there are several factors that are bringing down the number of international students in the u s chief among them being the trump administration s anti immigrant rhetoric rachel banks director of public policy at nafsa an international association of educators told cnn business nafsa estimates that the decline in international student enrollment since the fall of 2016 has cost the u s economy 11 8 billion and more than 65 000 jobs chinese students make up a large share of the international student population in the u s more than 360 000 chinese students went to u s universities in the 2017 2018 school year according to the institute of international education that number is expected to drop in the coming years the government is heavily encouraging high schools to send their kids elsewhere such as to northern europe and the u k says jiang xueqin an education consultant based in chengdu european countries are banking on this trend which also closely relates to china s trade and manufacturing ambitions for example the u k and china have launched an education partnership focused on asia pacific and central and eastern european nations the project aims to fund education projects in the field of advanced manufacturing during a recent visit to china french president emmanuel macron demonstrated how trade and education are at the top of europe s china agenda macron traveled to shanghai with two european officials the eu commissioner for trade and agriculture and germany s education minister

notes in the section entitled selected consolidated financial information of this press release for the definition of these items and when applicable their reconciliation with the most directly comparable gaap measure 2 comparative financial information and ratios have been restated to reflect the full retrospective application of ifrs 16 for lease accounting during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the corporation opened 21 net new stores compared to 14 net new stores during the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year i am very pleased with our strong top line performance through the first nine months of fiscal 2020 reflecting the strength of our business model and the continued appeal of our concept to consumers across canada based on our performance to date we are narrowing our underlying full year comparable store sales assumption to 4 0 to 4 5 the top end of the previously disclosed range said president and chief executive officer neil rossy we are also meeting our growth objectives with 21 net new stores opened in the third quarter and the upcoming completion of our distribution centre expansion project looking towards the fourth quarter we are on track to open 60 to 70 net new stores by fiscal year end and to meet our fiscal 2020 financial guidance on key metrics which remains unchanged since the last update on september 12 2019 added mr rossy finally our quarterly results now include our share of dollarcity s net earnings the dollarcity team continues to pursue its growth objectives with discipline and success and i am very excited by the long term potential of our second growth platform concluded mr rossy financial results sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased by 9 6 to 947 6 million compared to 864 3 million in the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year continued organic sales growth was fuelled by balanced growth in both comparable store sales and in the total number of stores over the past 12 months from 1 192 stores on october 28 2018 to 1 271 stores on november 3 2019 comparable store sales grew 5 3 in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 over and above comparable store sales growth of 3 1 in the same quarter a year ago comparable store sales growth for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 consisted of a 2 8 increase in average transaction size driven in part by an increase in the number of units per basket and a 2 4 increase in the number of transactions this increase is mainly driven by ongoing in store merchandising initiatives as well as the positive impact of the calendar shift caused by a 52 week fiscal year in fiscal 2020 following a 53 week fiscal year in fiscal 2019 with three additional halloween shopping days falling in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in fiscal 2019 gross margin was 43 7 of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to 44 3 of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 gross margin is lower primarily due to a slight decrease in the product margin and higher sales of lower margin items as well as higher logistics costs general administrative and store operating expenses sg a for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was 142 2 million compared to 120 7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 this increase is primarily related to the continued growth in the total number of stores sg a for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 represented 15 0 of sales compared to 14 0 of sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 the 1 0 increase is mainly the result of the timing of certain expenditures and of a slight increase in labour costs due to wage increases and to the fiscal year calendar shift with halloween packaway falling in the third quarter this year for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the corporation s 50 1 share of dollarcity s net earnings for the period from august 14 2019 the closing date of the acquisition to september 30 2019 the end date of dollarcity s third quarter was 1 7 million the corporation is accounting for its investment in dollarcity as a joint arrangement using the equity method net financing costs increased by 2 5 million from 22 7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 to 25 2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the increase is mainly due to an increase in average borrowings on long term debt and net financing costs also include costs related to lease liabilities as calculated under ifrs 16 for both periods other income includes a one time non recurring gain of 2 8 million or 2 1 million after tax representing the difference between the fair value of the call option to purchase 50 1 of dollarcity s issued and outstanding shares and the estimated purchase price of this investment as at august 14 2019 the closing date of the acquisition net earnings increased to 138 6 million or 0 44 per diluted common share in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to 132 1 million or 0 40 per diluted common share in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 this increase in net earnings is mainly the result of a 9 6 increase in sales the inclusion of the corporation s share of dollarcity s net earnings and the one time non recurring gain on the call option partially offset by lower margins and higher sg a as a percentage of sales earnings per common share were also positively impacted by the repurchase of shares through the corporation s normal course issuer bid over the past 12 months dollarcity estimated purchase price accounting and network growth update on august 14 2019 the corporation made an upfront payment of us 40 0 million 52 8 million as a result of its acquisition of a 50 1 interest in latin american value retailer dollarcity the total estimated purchase price of us 92 7 million 122 1 million as at november 3 2019

based on financial projections whereas the final purchase price will be based on audited financial statements as at november 3 2019 the estimated balance of the purchase price of us 52 7 million 69 3 million was recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and will be due subject to final adjustments in the third quarter of the corporation s next fiscal year ending january 31 2021 the

source stockcharts brent crude oil price brent crude oil is trading around 63 per barrel while wti crude oil west texas intermediate is hovering around 58 50 per barrel both registering slightly bullish momentum in the final month of the year the moderate gains in the price of crude oil since october have seen the price rising several dollars per barrel although the current price is neck and neck with the 50 day moving average and several dollars lower than the 200 day moving average price for brent crude oil true to form one of the most important technical indicators when trading crude oil is bollinger bands these upper and lower bands register 90 of trading activity taking place with crude oil when the price of crude oil is above the upper band it indicates an overbought market and is reflective of downward pressure on pricing this typically results in decreased demand increased supply and reduced prices given that the bands are within close proximity to one another it is clear that volatility has decreased recently however this simple moving average which takes place at 20 periods is an important indicator for oil traders if the price closes above the upper band you can expect oil price to weaken in coming trading sessions many of these technical strategies are employed by experts who trade oil with plus500 and other leading commodities brokers oil traders are advised to watch the upper band as very few closing prices should ever exceed the upper bollinger band most of the prices intraday and end of day should fall within the range of the lower band and the upper band and are typically grouped around the simple moving average line which is the center line breakouts occur when the price closes outside of the bands and corrections will invariably result while all crude oil is typically grouped together when discussions of this important commodity take place there is a difference between wti crude oil and brent crude oil wti crude oil is trading at a lower price point than brent crude oil 58 50 with a 50 day moving average of 55 53 and 200 day moving average of 57 51 the recent bull market with crude oil has put some pep in oil prices but that could reverse just as easily much like the bollinger bands for brent crude oil the band s for wti light crude oil have also tightened in recent days however it is unlikely that a breakout will take place just yet we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us performance of the usd and crude oil the usd is up for the year to date against a basket of currencies but only marginally so current usd weakness is evident against other major currencies like gbp however a strong us dollar serves as a disincentive to further gains in the oil price the reason being oil is a dollar denominated asset as the price of oil rises in usd so other countries which purchase oil can afford to buy less per unit of their currency when converted into usd the us dollar index is currently hovering around 97 with a 52 week high of 99 and a 52 week low of 95 simply put this indicates that the dollar has tapered off from its highs but is still competitive enough on the international markets to warrant careful consideration the fact that the dollar strengthens and weakens against other currencies is important when it comes to vital commodities like crude oil countries that are particularly oil rich like canada saudi arabia iran iraq russia et al are affected more by dollar strength or weakness than countries like south africa malawi and japan that have low stockpiles of crude oil it should be noted that crude oil is a major determinant of inflationary pressures in the global economy when oil prices rise consumers have to pay more across the board this was easily seen when crude prices were 100 plus per barrel and inflation was steadily rising now that oil is trading in the 55 65 range per barrel there is less of an effect on inflation but it still needs to be watched inflation deflation and oil prices when the price of crude oil drops in usd countries that are oil rich tend to suffer immeasurably this can even cause a recession in those countries when oil rich countries bring in smaller usd denominated receipts from exports of crude this affects the gdp of the country and ultimately places a squeeze on economic activity deflation is one of the most feared economic conditions and the currencies of these countries tend to suffer significantly when oil prices decline when prices move in the opposite direction inflationary pressures become a reality government can guard against rising oil prices by subsidizing the cost for consumers ultimately though it s the consumers who pay the burden through increased taxes this also places a squeeze on personal disposable income levels there is also another factor that is helping to keep oil prices in check decreased demand by china the us china trade war has served to weaken the chinese manufacturing juggernaut immeasurably the currency chinese yuan has weakened against the usd and this means that china is purchasing less crude oil to sustain its manufacturing enterprises all in all decreased demand by china will keep prices lower than oil producing countries would like on the other hand the reduction of oil supply by sanctions on iran and the destruction of saudi arabian oil production serve to balance the market out disclaimer this content does not necessarily represent the views of iwb
