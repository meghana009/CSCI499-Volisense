discussion of each country s individual performances during q4 2018 below all trends are expressed in local currency in russia total revenue in q4 2018 increased by 7 8 driven by an increase in mobile service revenue and strong growth in sales of equipment and accessories of 138 which was attributable to the additional monobrand stores following the euroset integration and rebranding which began in q1 2018 mobile service revenue improved compared to q3 2018 increasing by 3 1 driven by growth in vas and mobile data revenue of 4 0 year on year fixed line service revenue declined 8 5 due to a decrease of approximately rub 0 8 billion in transit traffic service revenue which was centralized at veon wholesale services excluding which fixed line revenue would have decreased by 0 3 the stabilization in fixed line revenue was driven by continued positive dynamics in both b2c and b2b segments ebitda decreased by 0 9 in q4 2018 the decrease in ebitda was mainly driven by the increase in annual spectrum fees of rub 0 9 billion and the impact of the euroset integration costs of approximately rub 0 4 billion in q3 2018 a 30 increase in annual spectrum fees was introduced retrospectively for fy2018 leading to an increase of 87 year on year during the quarter the annual spectrum fees were reduced to previous levels from january 2019 the ebitda margin decreased by 2 9 percentage points to 32 8 and was further impacted by the change in revenue mix as a result of the strong growth in sales of equipment and accessories which are characterized by lower margins the impact of the change in revenue mix on ebitda margin in q4 2018 was approximately 2 1 percentage points the euroset integration is an important milestone in executing on beeline s monobrand strategy now that the rebranding and integration of the euroset stores is complete beeline expects a positive effect on revenue going forward while ebitda is expected to be positively impacted from 2019 onwards driven by acceleration in device sales and distribution channel mix improvement in pakistan total revenue growth 22 7 year on year accelerated sequentially 9 9 percentage points of this growth came from business performance and 12 8 percentage points were driven by higher usage by customers mainly due to suspension of taxes collected from customers by mobile operators which continued in q4 2018 and provided the whole market with additional revenue growth mobile data revenue growth accelerated sequentially to 86 7 year on year helped by an increase in data customers and data usage through higher bundle penetration and continued data network expansion total customer base increased by 4 8 year on year and was broadly flat quarter on quarter driven by data network expansion and growth in data subscribers 15 9 year on year ebitda posted a healthy growth of 26 0 and ebitda margin was 47 0 an increase of 1 2 percentage points year on year excluding tax related factors for both q4 2017 and 2018 ebitda growth would have been 19 8 and ebitda margin would have increased by 3 9 percentage points year on year in algeria operating trends stabilized further during q4 2018 with the customer base growing quarter on quarter total revenue decreased by 1 7 year on year a slower pace of decline compared to q3 2018 as a result of both operational stabilization with sequential customer growth and favourable adjustments mostly related to the reversal of a liability towards a vendor of approximately dzd 0 7 billion excluding the favourable adjustments revenue would have decreased by 4 5 year on year a lower rate of decline compared to 6 7 in q3 2018 price competition in both voice and data caused a continued reduction in arpu which declined by 7 4 year on year djezzy s q4 2018 service revenue reported a 3 7 year on year decline while data revenue growth was 67 1 due to higher usage and a substantial increase in data customers as a result of the 3g and 4g lte network roll out acceleration the net customer additions trend which was still positive during q4 2018 led to customer growth of 1 3 quarter on quarter and 5 7 year on year the quarter on quarter growth was driven by continued positive uptake of new offers launched earlier in the year ebitda increased by 4 9 year on year the decline in revenues coupled with increased taxation an increase of technology costs and additional channel incentives were more than offset by the favourable revenue adjustments and the release of certain provisions totalling dzd 1 3 billion in q4 2018 excluding the revenue adjustments and the release of certain provisions ebitda would have decreased by 7 7 year on year and the ebitda margin would have been at 41 4 in bangladesh total revenue grew by 1 3 year on year in q4 2018 driven by service revenues which increased by 2 6 year on year this increase represents a stabilization of the revenue trend after two years of quarterly year on year decline and was achieved despite banglalink s 3g network coverage gap compared to competitors service revenue was broadly flat quarter on quarter in q4 2018 an improvement compared to last year when q4 was lower than q3 the revenue increase was mainly driven by an acceleration of data revenue growth resulting from network improvement during the quarter following spectrum acquisition in q1 2018 and enhanced network availability along with the continued expansion of banglalink s distribution footprint the customer base grew by 3 1 year on year and was stable quarter on quarter supported by improved distribution and network

revenue growth is still supported by the change towards a more aggressive data pricing strategy that has been in place since the beginning of 2018 the net customer additions trend which was still positive during q4 2018 led to customer growth of 1 3 quarter on quarter and 5 7 year on year the quarter on quarter growth was driven by continued positive uptake of new offers launched earlier in

networks as the clear market leader unitel continues to focus on high value customers offering a high quality mobile network the company continued to report revenue growth in q4 2018 driven by repricing initiatives introduced in march 2018 concentrating on upselling customers to higher price plans with increased allowances however this increase was more than offset by external cost pressures on the ebitda level such as the increased customer tax and the effect of the mtr reduction in q3 2018 total revenue for the quarter increased by 1 2 year on year and mobile service revenue

margin was 40 0 in q4 2018 mainly due to external factors such as the increase in customer tax approximately uzs 34 2 billion and the negative impact of the reduction in mobile termination rates approximately uzs 9 billion furthermore ebitda was negatively impacted by non recurring costs and certain provisions of uzs 22 billion in q4 2018 while q4 2017 was negatively impacted by a provision

published monday 25 february 2019 print disqus a statistician is someone who can draw a straight line from an unwarranted assumption to a foregone conclusion anonymous you know a country is falling apart when even the government will not accept its own currency jim rogers financier adventure capitalist b 1942 the generally accepted view is that markets are always right that is market prices tend to discount future developments accurately even when it is unclear what those developments are i start with the opposite point of view i believe that market prices are always wrong in that they present a biased view of the future george soros 1987 financier philanthropist political activist author philosopher b 1930 in our report of january 28 2019 we examined the possible existence of a 90 year cycle of depressions and wars what struck us in looking at those collapses was the common themes that kept recurring monetary and credit expansion currency wars trade wars speculation whether in the stock market land or something else a something else this time was bitcoin and the crypto currencies are themes that pop up again and again all of this was usually played out against the backdrop of wars and growing social unrest the end result was a stock market collapse sharply rising unemployment wars banking and business failures bankruptcies and in some instances droughts and famine that led to wars the causes of the financial collapse of 2008 were never fully addressed the answer given was bail outs on an unprecedented scale ultra low interest rates including sub zero interest rates japan and the eu massive amounts of liquidity provided through quantitative easing qe and the biggest credit expansion in history none of these were solutions they were merely huge band aids to cover up and gloss over the rot that had set into the global financial system we read an interesting article from alasdair macleod entitled currencies threatened by a credit crisis where he examined factors leading up to the financial and systemic collapse of the 1930s and how these same factors are at work today if macleod is right along with others who are giving similar warnings then we could be faced with a coming collapse that no one is prepared for the current rebound in the stock markets is being accompanied by a high degree of complacency that the worst of the slump that sparked the october december 2018 collapse is over what we set out below is our attempt to compare the two periods leading up to in the first case the great depression and in the second case leading up to where we are now the roaring twenties bull market got its start out of the short but sharp recession depression of 1920 1921 it was a deflationary depression complicated by the return of millions of veterans from ww1 the devastation caused by the spanish flu that resulted in the death of tens of millions globally and the failure of economies to adjust properly from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy from the top in november 1919 to the bottom in august 1921 the dow jones industrials dji fell 46 6 the current bull market got its start out of the most serious financial crisis since the great depression it started with the crisis in the sub prime mortgage market and developed into a full blown international banking crisis culminating in the collapse of lehman brothers in september 2008 massive bailouts of financial institutions accompanied by monetary policies were geared to prevent a possible systemic collapse of the global financial system from the top in october 2007 to the bottom in march 2009 the dji fell 53 8 the roaring twenties bull market was one of the greatest speculative bull markets in history from the bottom in august 1921 to the top in september 1929 the dji gained a spectacular 497 along the way there were only a couple of shallow corrections most notably the one from march to october 1923 when the dji fell about 19 the second one lasted briefly from october 1925 to march 1926 and the dji fell only about 10 the roaring twenties was a period of unprecedented economic prosperity although not everyone benefitted as society transitioned from a rural one to an urban one rural farming and coal mining stagnated during this period factories converted from wartime production to consumer production setting off an age of consumerism benefitting industries were in autos radio cinema especially the proliferation of movies culminating in sound movies aviation and early television there were advances in medicine and it was an age of building particularly of new infrastructure to accommodate the growing consumer society there was much more the bull market of the 1920s lasted eight years what the bull market of 2009 2018 lost in gains it gained in longevity the bull market that got underway in march 2009 and that may have made its final top in october 2018 lasted nine and half years and rose 312 along the way there only two generally shallow corrections the first occurred with the eu greek debt crisis of 2011 and saw the dji lose 16 8 while the second drop occurred in 2015 2016 with the end of qe the dji fell 14 5 while the bull market 2009 2018 was a broad market advance it was dominated essentially by five companies known as the faangs facebook apple amazon netflix google alphabet the period has been dominated by technological advances particularly with mobile phones and a shift to streaming which is challenging mainstream television and movies globalization has expanded on huge scale robotics has also become a big thing there were many dislocations as a result of globalization and technological advances which are causing social unrest as a result of all the technological advances and globalization incomes have mostly stagnated but the upper 20 of society has done very well with the upper 1 doing exceptionally well the yield on the u s 10 year treasury note peaked in april 1920 at 5 67 over the next several years the yield fell sharply bottoming in march 1926 at 3 17 the fed began to tighten and after a pause following the stock market crash the tightening continued topping in january 1932 at 4 26 the 1920s was a period of massive credit expansion although the main beneficiaries were commercial and industrial business as consumer loans had not yet taken hold the yield on the u s 10 year treasury note peaked in june 2007 at 5 32 following the financial crisis of 2008 the fed pushed the key fed rate effectively to zero the 10 year bottomed in yield in july 2012 at 1 38 the fed began to raise interest rates in december 2015 and only recently announced a pause in interest rate hikes the period 2009 2018 has seen an unprecedented credit expansion for both commercial and industrial business as well as for the consumer and especially for government both the consumer and the government were largely absent from the 1920s credit expansion note that during the 1930s there were numerous sovereign defaults most notably in latin america on october 30 1929 congress passed the smoot hawley tariff act the markets seemed to have gotten wind of it in advance and a massive stock market sell off was underway by the time the markets bottomed in november 1929 they had lost 47 9 from the stock market top seen in early september 1929 it was an unprecedented collapse and it was one of the most brutal destruction of personal wealth ever seen a rebound rally did get underway that carried through until the end of april 1930 where it saw the dji regain 48 smoot hawley became law in june 1930 by that time the biggest stock market collapse in history was underway it didn t bottom until july 1932 and by that time the dji was down 86 in january 2018 president trump launched his trade war with china slapping tariffs on washing machines and solar panels soon he was expanding with tariffs on steel and aluminum against the eu mexico and canada and further tariffs on china china retaliated with tariffs against u s soybeans and others others retaliated as well the stock markets reacted negatively and by mid february the dji was down just over 12 as it turned out that was just about it the market initially rebounded falling again into early april 2018 but overall the dji was only down just over 12 a rebound got underway into september october 2018 as the dji gained just over 15 setting small new all time highs trade war spats broke out again in september 2018 but this time the market reaction was more negative by december 2018 the dji had fallen over 19 soothing words from the fed and indications that china and the u s would work out their trade disputes sparked a sharp rally in stocks that is still ongoing so far the dji has regained almost 20 while how it unfolds is different it was trade disputes that triggered the stock market sell offs in both 1929 and 2018 during the 1920s productivity grew but wage growth was actually suppressed as the power of unions fell by the end of the 1920s 1 of the population controlled roughly 30 of the wealth an unprecedented period of wealth concentration the great depression and war leveled things out and wealth concentration was on a downward track until about 1978 when it started to rise again as with the 1920s the past twenty years have seen wage growth suppressed and again the power of the unions has fallen but this time the wealth concentration is even higher than it was during the 1920s with 1 of the population controlling 47 of the wealth many live paycheck to paycheck and have little in the way of financial assets to draw on in the event of a job loss does history rhyme or merely echo a 90 year cycle is generational the current generation forgets or dismisses what happened 90 years ago as that was then it s different now or is it it is always the cry of this time it s different except that it never is the 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of fascist groups that ultimately seized power in italy germany spain and japan while they failed in great britain france and the u s they were present nonetheless today we see the rise of xenophobic alt right groups riots and clashes on the streets of the united kingdom france spain eastern europe and the u s alt right groups have seized power in a few countries such as hungary poland and more recently brazil and as some would say the u s the great powers continued to circle each other even as ww1 was long over and germany lost but the tensions remained great britain france germany japan today the cold war is over but the great powers circle each other u s russia and china ninety years ago the circling culminated in ww2 today the doomsday clock has been set to two minutes to midnight a reminder of albert einstein s quote i know not with what weapons world war iii will be fought but world war iv will be fought with sticks and stones the world is at a potentially dangerous crossroads except it is not being reflected in the stock markets the world is laden with debt 250 trillion and debt collapse has been at the heart of every major financial collapse and depression social order is under strain in the west the great powers circle each other and then there is the threat of the potentially devastating effects of climate change we ve already seen the devastation and cost of super hurricanes massive wildfires earthquakes monster and freak tornadoes droughts extreme flooding rising seas extreme weather including freezing cold and killer snow storms in winter followed by killer heat in the summer the expectation is there is more to come we are already seeing the effects in the financial sector as the banks pull in their horns tightening credit conditions governments are strapped and constrained by their own debt constraints and depending on the government in power massive cuts could be coming to the public sector that result in the loss of thousands of jobs trade wars are no panacea to the problems of the world history has shown time and time again that trade wars are devastating to the global economy and often end in real wars the introduction now of tariffs and trade wars as the economy is topping could eventually prove lethal to the economy and to the stock market central banks are ill prepared for another crisis on the scale of 2008 no wonder legislation was passed that in the event of another crisis there would not be bail outs instead it is bail ins meaning it is the depositor and bond holder who are at risk central banks are diverging as both the russian and chinese central banks cbr and pboc are leading the way in accumulating gold as their main reserve currency china is the world s largest producer of gold when the next crisis is upon us and the question is when not if governments will likely once again have to resort to massive injections of liquidity that in turn would lead to a massive devaluation in the value of their fiat currencies they could apply severe austerity however that is assured to result in the loss of thousands of jobs there is a way out but they are ill prepared or unwilling to consider once again backing their currencies with gold gold however is currently grossly undervalued for what would be required to act as a stabilizer as happened in the 1930s when franklin roosevelt devalued the u s dollar and hiked the price of gold to 35 ounce from 20 67 ounce today that would be equivalent of hiking the gold price to around 2 300 the reality is it would need to be considerably higher to meet the requirements of what took place in 1934 as we noted at the outset we are ill prepared for what may come many will outright dismiss the idea that it could even happen what is needed is a trigger a lehman brothers moment high levels of complacency existed before all past collapses we harken back again to this time it s different the only thing that is really different is that it is a new generation as the previous generation who lived through the last collapse is gone

continues the s p 500 was up another 0 6 this past week and is now up 11 4 on the year everyone else continues their winning ways as well the dow jones industrials dji gained 0 6 and is up 11 6 in 2019 the dow jones transportations djt was up 0 2 this past week and is up 15 5 on the year and the nasdaq gained 0 7 and is now up 13 5 on the year elsewhere the tsx composite jumped 1 1 while the tsx venture exchange cdnx regained its winning ways rising 1 2 this past week overseas the london ftse 100 was one of the few that slipped this past week losing 0 9 but not the paris cac 40 as it gained 1 2 and the recession bitten german dax was up 3 3 the tokyo nikkei dow tkn gained 1 5 while china s shanghai index ssec was up 3 1 the stock market continued to rise buoyed by the possibility of a deal between the u s and china on the trade front and by the thought that the fed might pause its interest rate hikes the march fomc is march 19 20 and the fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged as well u s economic numbers continue to be good couple that with earnings that are still good and stock markets are propelled higher the question is how much higher we have mused about a run for the dji to 30 000 it is possible but we are not going to guarantee it the s p 500 would rise to around 3 250 currently there is major resistance at 2 825 and we note the rsi is quite high over 70 a level that is normally associated with pullbacks but pullbacks can be shallow and a firm breakout above 2 825 could suggest new highs ahead and trigger a buying panic we note pretty good support down to 2 700 only a breakdown under 2 600 would turn the market more negative the market remains in good shape and higher prices are indicated even if there was a pullback and as long as the positives remain that way source www stockcharts com the nyse advance decline continues to soar into record territory even as the s p 500 is itself not making new highs is this a divergence at the top in september october 2018 the s p 500 made new highs but the advance decline did not now it is the opposite as the advance decline line makes new highs but is not confirmed by the s p 500 it may be that new highs for the s p 500 are to come the advance decline line appears to be leading the way and that suggests that new highs lie ahead source www stockcharts com the mcclellan summation index has soared high into bullish territory at 1 252 it is as high as it has been at any time over the past five years it doesn t mean the market is going to pull back from here but it at least suggests some waning momentum note that for the rise from november 2016 to the top in january 2018 the mcclellan summation index never hit the same highs as it did in the initial runup from the february 2016 low yet the market made its best gains during that period still the current high level does suggest that a pullback may be in order before the market resumes its upward trend source www stockcharts com the nyse advance decline line may be making new all time highs but the nasdaq advance decline line is nowhere near all time high levels the nasdaq has had a good runup from december and the advance decline is higher but generally it is lagging maybe the nasdaq is not as bullish as it looks the nasdaq advance decline line is also diverging with the nyse advance decline line source www stockcharts com the cboe options put call ratio has now pulled itself out of bullish territory and is more neutral this may be a sign that the current rally is beginning to wane a pullback that takes the put call ratio deep into oh woe is us territory would be a signal that the market is now too bearish but we are nowhere near those levels source www stockcharts com the tsx composite has experienced quite a sharp rise from the december 2018 low the gain thus far is just over 16 still the tsx remains down about 3 5 from its all time high seen in july 2018 it is now approaching downtrend line resistance the rsi has been almost consistently over 70 for the past few weeks the rsi can stay over 70 for some time as we saw last year but eventually it succumbs and a downdraft takes place usually a swift one we note strength in income trusts consumer staples financials golds mining health care real estate information technology telecommunications and utilities we d be cautious with the tsx at current levels as it appears poised for a pullback any pullback towards 15 000 would likely be a positive buying opportunity under 15 000 and all bets are off source www stockcharts com the tsx bullish percent index is fairly neutral despite the sharp rise in the index and given it is only about 3 5 from its all time highs our expectations would have been that this index would be higher now except that it appears poised to make another lower high which is negative for the tsx going forward another sign that one should now start to be cautious about this recent rise source www stockcharts com the bulls seem to be back in force for bitcoin bitcoin put in one of best weeks in some time jumping 10 8 this past week to over 3 900 bitcoin is now incredibly up on the year with a gain of 4 6 major resistance is seen up to 5 000 we would be surprised if bitcoin got that high the quadriga scandal continues to linger in the background regulators continue to pounce but on the good news side bitcoin s daily trend has turned up for the first time in months a move above 4 100 could suggest a run to 5 000 we are not sure what is sparking the bullishness but we do note that samsung is planning for a private crypto storage key in its new galaxy s10 there remains for whatever reason well over 2 000 different cryptos listed at coin market cap www coinmarketcap com and there are still a dozen cryptos led by bitcoin with a market cap of over 1 billion overall the crypto market cap sits at around 140 billon at the peak in december 2017 bitcoin s market cap was at

indices the msci topped in january 2018 and since then has been in a steady downtrend the downtrend accelerated from september to december 2018 in all the msci fell almost 23 from its january 2018 top the current rebound has seen the msci rise 11 6 which is sub par for most of the other indices the msci is now running into the 200 day ma currently near 1 890 further downtrend resistance can be seen up to 1 925 our expectation is that the msci could see rough going from here a breakdown reversal however would not occur until the msci broke back under 1 800 source www stockcharts com we thought we d show the vanguard total world stock etf vt nyse as a proxy for the world stocks unlike the msci world index vt does contain a number of major u s stocks note that after topping in january 2018 vt failed to make new highs into september october as did the u s indices the plunge into december was rather nasty and vt was down 20 2 from its january 2018 high since then vt is up 17 and a move over 74 25 could signal a rush to new highs for vt note the rsi is over 70 suggesting that a pause at least could occur here source www stockcharts com there is little to report here on the 10 year u s treasury note the yield slipped to 2 65 from 2 66 this past week the yield appears to be trying to work its way lower but unless there is firm evidence of a slowing u s economy then the odds of lower yields begin to dissipate any hint this month at the fomc march 19 20 that the fed might hike again could actually send the yield on the 10 year higher so far 2 56 remains the recent low at best we describe the current situation as neutral and the yield could go either way recession watch spread source www stockcharts com the u s 10 year treasury note 2 year treasury note spread rose to 17 bp this past week the spread continues to hint that the u s is at least for the moment nowhere near a recession however the trend does remain down as long as it stays under 18 bp a break under 14 bp would signal lower levels ahead note the 2 10 spread generally bottomed with the stock market in december the high over the past year of 78 bp generally coincided with the stock market top of january 2018 source www stockcharts com the us index continues to trace out what appears to be a large topping pattern it is one that has now stretched to almost one year the us index slipped 0 4 this past week the euro gained 0 3 while the brexit challenged pound sterling was up 1 3 the japanese yen slipped a small 0 2 but the canadian jumped 0 9 the us continues to maintain its dominance largely because the others are not doing well germany and italy are sliding into recession as are japan and the u k a no deal brexit is not a good deal for the u k nor for that matter the eu japan is also sliding into recession hence the weakness in the yen the canadian is being buoyed by higher oil prices the fomc meets march 19 20 and while it is widely expected that the fed will leave rates unchanged any hint that they might hike again could push the us higher the breakdown point remains near 95 and especially under 94 50 source www stockcharts com the canadian has been buoyed by higher oil prices no it doesn t care that much about the snc lavalin problem the canadian was up 0 9 this past week a rising trendline from the 0 7330 low is now visible and our expectations are that we should next push towards the downtrend line near 0 77 a breakout over 0 77 would be quite positive and suggest higher levels to come for the canadian probably up to 0 80 0 82 only a break now below 0 75 could negate this positive scenario source www stockcharts com gold pushed into our major resistance zone this past week with a high at 1 349 80 there is still some room for gold to make a higher high but major resistance is now clear up to around 1 365 we have noted the major resistance that defines this zone with highs of 1 377 1 362 and 1 369 respectively in 2016 2017 and 2018 our expectations are that the first approach to this major resistance zone will be met with failure but ultimately this time we should push through to 1 400 we note that gold s rsi hit over 70 this past week a zone often associated with tops while we cannot rule out one more high here the question is how far will gold pull back currently good support zones could be seen at 1 300 1 310 but below that level the next good support zone would be 1 280 1 285 and below that 1 255 1 260 only below 1237 would we become concerned and below 1 210 new lows would be possible we doubt we will fall that far our best call is that gold could yes pull back to the 1 255 1 260 zone pdac is in a week and that annual gold miner s fest often signals a top as well we have the march fomc on march 19 20 and any sign that the fed is thinking of tightening again could spook gold to the downside a reminder that economic numbers in the u s continue to be positive the woes of germany and japan have not translated themselves into the u s as well continued signs of the u s and china talking nicely will also help push gold lower again we can t rule out some small new highs up to 1 365 but our suspicion is we have hit at least a temporary high source www cotpricecharts com the commercial cot for gold slipped this past week to 35 from 37 note that the cftc continues to play some catch up on the data this data is good only to february 5 2019 if we were up to date it would be good until february 19 still it is indicative since the trend has switched to the downside again long open interest fell about 6 000 contracts while short open interest rose about 6 000 contracts the large speculators cot hedge funds managed futures etc rose to 67 from 65 this report isn t overly bearish or bullish to become more bearish we would want to see consistent readings under 30 for gold but the trend here is down so another sign that suggests a pullback source www stockcharts com gold and the japanese yen tend to follow each other so when they don t it could signal that one of them is out of line here is gold and yen over the past year note that both followed each other down to lows in october 2018 they also started to rise again but in early 2019 the yen changed course over the past few weeks the yen has been falling while gold kept on rising one of them is out of line we suspect that gold will soon join yen and slide source www stockcharts com silver prices hit a high this past week of 16 20 equalling the high seen on january 31 2019 the failure to take that high out set up a potential negative divergence between gold and silver as gold did see new highs in the end silver managed to close up on the week by 1 1 but that was 1 8 off the high of the week we like to see both gold and silver making new highs together thus confirming each other the failure this week of silver to confirm suggests to us a possible pullback a potential pullback zone would be down to 15 50 and the rising trendline from the november low if that broke then silver could test back towards 15 new highs above 16 20 would suggest that other factors are at play we are somewhat disappointed that silver failed to meet our requirements of rising to at least 16 50 silver has been sluggish on this rise and is nowhere near the highs of 2017 or even 2018 gold on the other hand this past week is testing into those key areas of the highs of 2016 2018 silver has been making progressively lower highs each year since spiking to 21 23 in 2016 still we believe silver made an important low in november 2018 at 13 86 that low came ten years after the october 2008 low silver has exhibited in the past cycles of nine year lows range 7 11 years it is interesting that the first low came in december 2015 which was seven years after the 2008 low and now the most recent one in november it may also have been a multi year double bottom for silver since we are still in the time frame for major cycle lows in silver we cannot rule out completely another low in 2019 silver regaining above 16 50 would signal that the low is in source www cotpricecharts com the most recent silver commercial cot was unchanged this past week at 32 there was however a jump of about 3 000 contracts in long open interest and jump in short open interest of about 9 000 contracts the large speculators cot was also largely unchanged at 73 the cot is not outright bearish but it is suggesting caution source www stockcharts com have the gold stocks topped here this past week the tsx gold index tgd spiked to a high of 201 22 then reversed and closed that day virtually unchanged the tgd then closed 2 4 off the high although it held on to its weekly gains with a gain of 3 3 the gold bugs index hui acted similarly but still managed a 3 9 gain on the week it is interesting to note that the tgd made new 52 week highs but the hui did not a possible negative divergence it is also possible that the tgd has completed five waves up from the november low the pattern from the september low continues to appear corrective the tgd also hit our target of 200 our suspicion is we could now see a pullback key areas of support would be at 188 50 180 60 and 174 25 only below 168 would we become concerned that a steeper drop was in play new highs would at least temporarily hold off any thoughts of a corrective pullback the gold miners bullish percent index bpgdm is at a pretty neutral 44 so in theory there is considerable room for gold stocks to go higher it is noteworthy that in 2016 the bpgdm was at similar levels it wasn t until july 2016 that the bpgdm hit 100 an unheard of level that signaled the top ultimately the tgd should go much higher but a pause now would allow the gold stocks to regroup ironically the announcement that barrick gold was proposing to take over newmont may have inadvertently signaled the current top bullish events like this often trigger a top we noted a number of individual stocks hit new highs this past week and then reversed back down again source www stockcharts com oil prices continued their recent rise jumping 2 3 this past week wti oil is now up 26 1 on the year it is once again the big winner on the year a reminder that oil prices started out 2018 on a tear but ended the year down opec supply cuts hope on the china us trade front and continued tensions in venezuela all helped push prices higher this past week wti oil is now running into a zone of resistance that stretches from current levels near 57 and up to 63 64 the 50 retracement level of the entire drop from 76 90 in october to the low of 42 36 in december is at 59 63 wti oil needs to regain above 69 to suggest that new highs above 76 90 are possible dampeners on oil prices would be surging production particularly in the u s despite the enthusiasm in the crude market it did not translate to the energy stocks as the nyse oil gas index xoi was actually off small less than 0 1 on the week while the tsx energy index ten gained a small 0 6 it is possible that is a divergence and we could be poised for a pullback given that both the energy indices and wti oil are at potential key ma resistance levels a pullback might be quite logical chart of the week source www stockcharts com our chart of the week is a reminder that since the collapse in the market got underway in september gold has continued to outperform by a wide margin the indices have recovered nicely but with the exception of the dji all remain down since september 1 2018 the dji has gained a small 0 3 while gold is up 10 5 the nasdaq has been the weakest performer as it remains down 7 2 since september copyright david chapman 2019 technical scoop charts and commentary by david chapman chief strategist

there is a growing debate in europe as to whether recent shifts in global governance should be seen as a reason to strengthen the global role of the euro juncker 2018 european commission 2018 european council 2018 according to some being the issuer of a global reserve currency confers international monetary power in particular the capacity to weaponise access to the financial and payments systems this debate takes place against a gradual decline of the euro s global role from the mid 2000s onwards see figure 1 despite the euro area s economic size and trading heft the euro lags behind the us dollar by a wide margin for most measures of global standing see figure 2 figure 1 index of the euro s international role percentages four quarter moving averages sources bis imf cls ilzetzki reinhart and rogoff 2017 and ecb calculations notes arithmetic average of the shares of the euro at constant exchange rates in stocks of international bonds cross border loans cross border deposits foreign exchange settlements global foreign exchange reserves and exchange rate regimes data on the share of the euro in global trade invoicing were not available those on foreign exchange settlements are at market exchange rates the latest data are for the fourth quarter of 2017 figure 2 snapshot of the international monetary system percentages sources bis imf swift gopinath 2015 and ecb calculations note data as at the fourth quarter of 2017 or latest available data for the euro exclude intra euro area transactions except for payments and invoicing as a result the view is that if europe does not actively promote the use of the euro in global financial markets and in international trade it will be increasingly exposed to the risk that the monetary power of others is used against its interests e g tooze and odendahl 2018 the ecb does not take a view on foreign policy questions it does not decide on the role of europe in the world or on who uses the euro globally or not but as central bank we are not indifferent to the current debate for two main reasons the first reason relates to the alignment between the policies that will strengthen the euro s global role and the policies that are needed to make the euro area more robust specifically three broad shortcomings are likely to have affected the international role of the euro first international currencies need to provide stability and safety during times of global financial stress this is what some have coined the exorbitant duty of international currency status gourinchas et al 2011 caballero et al 2015 us treasuries are widely viewed by international investors as such a safe store of value he et al forthcoming the euro area lacks this common safe asset since 2008 the number of aaa rated euro area sovereigns fell from eight to three today aaa rated euro area sovereign debt amounts to just 10 of gdp in the us it is more than 70 see figure 3 figure 3 debt securities issued by central governments 2018 as a percentage of gdp sources oecd government statistics imf weo and ecb staff calculations notes outstanding amounts at market value for the euro area publicly held treasury securities outstanding for the us the blue bars in the chart report debt securities as rated by both standard and poor s and moody s local currency long term debt rating considerable progress has been made in improving the euro area governance framework in recent years 1 but for the euro to act as a true effective hedge in times of stress and therefore to attain and maintain international status we need to further strengthen the fiscal dimension of economic and monetary union emu sound fiscal and structural policies are needed to provide international investors with what they need most a large and elastic supply of safe assets and since the journey towards a true european safe asset one that does not vanish on rainy days will be long and bumpy we should also focus our efforts on upgrading the credit quality of outstanding debt by committing to credible fiscal rules the second shortcoming of the euro area is the segmentation of its capital markets deep and liquid financial markets are key ingredients of an international currency financial deepening was an important contributor to helping the dollar dethrone the pound sterling as the leading international currency chiţu et al 2014 capital markets in europe are still fragmented along national lines various legal and institutional barriers hinder the creation of a single european market the capital markets union should be a key priority for the next european commission and parliament ecb 2015 the third and final factor that has likely held back the international role of the euro relates to the ability of europe to speak with one voice on international affairs empirical evidence suggests that nations that depend on the us security umbrella hold a disproportionate share of their foreign reserves in dollars 2 of course addressing this aspect extends beyond emu but it means that european initiatives to foster cooperation on security and defence and to speak with one voice on international affairs might help foster the euro s global outreach too the second reason why the current debate on the euro s global role is relevant for the ecb is that a stronger international role of the euro would likely have tangible implications for the conduct and transmission of monetary policy first is the effect on exchange rate pass through the more the domestic currency is used for trade invoicing the less the pass through to import prices in the face of fluctuations in the exchange rate the tight correlation between domestic currency invoicing and exchange rate pass through is evident in the euro area see figure 4 figure 4 exchange rate pass through to import prices vs euro invoicing across euro area countries source the international role of the euro ecb july 2015 notes long run exchange rate pass through is estimated using a standard log linear regression model of the quarterly log change in import price unit values on the quarterly changes of the standard broad measure of the neer 38 of the euro a quarterly effective measure of inflation in production costs of the euro area s major trading partners and the quarterly log change in industrial production excluding construction the estimation sample spans the time period from the first quarter of 2000 to the last quarter of 2014 the share of euro invoicing reported on the x axis is the average over the sample period the black line is a fitted regression line the degree of pass through in turn has competing effects on the transmission of shocks on the one hand lower pass through means that import prices are better shielded from exogenous exchange rate shocks and monetary policy can focus more on domestic sources of inflationary pressures 3 on the other hand increased local currency pricing would in principle attenuate the exchange rate channel of monetary policy that said exchange rate pass through has already notably declined over the past two decades in the euro area mainly due to the declining share of commodity imports and the increasing role of global value chains cœuré 2017 the second way in which an international currency is relevant for monetary policy is its effect on financial conditions in principle international currency issuers enjoy greater monetary autonomy they often tend to influence monetary conditions globally thereby creating spillovers and spillbacks through international trade and finance for example the increased use of the euro as an international funding currency would amplify the international risk taking channel of monetary policy which operates through international bank leverage 4 and if the euro were used more for trade among third countries a depreciation of the euro would make all euro denominated exports cheaper from euro area and non euro area firms alike this would cause an increase in global trade with potentially positive spillbacks not least as the euro area is more open to trade than the us see also boz et al 2017 at the same time international currencies are not isolated from foreign spillovers it is well documented for example that the large demand for us securities by foreign central banks in the run up to the financial crisis contributed to the decline in longer term us interest rates thereby in part offsetting the parallel tightening efforts by the federal open market committee 5 it is not that these effects are completely absent in the euro area today as the second most important reserve currency demand from foreign central banks can also be expected to have affected euro area financing conditions cœuré 2018b but there is a difference and it is due to the aforementioned lack of a single safe asset according to the imf s coordinated portfolio investment survey foreign central banks currently hold more than 40 of their euro denominated debt reserves in german government bonds well above germany s share of total outstanding euro denominated sovereign bonds which is around 15 the implication is that a better functioning economic and monetary union could be expected to lead to a more even distribution of reserve demand effects and more generally flight to safety effects across the euro area this by itself would benefit the transmission of our monetary policy the flipside is that central banks in smaller economies could turn more frequently to the ecb for currency swap lines when the tide turns i e if and when international liquidity in euro dries up the ecb would then be called on to increase its activities as an international lender of last resort any extension of the global network of currency swap lines would however have to be based on sound monetary arguments central banks are mindful of global financial stability but they always act in full discretion and within domestic mandates concluding remarks in sum two tentative conclusions can be drawn at this stage the first is that the decline in the euro s international role in recent years is primarily a symptom of the initial fault lines of emu efforts that help overcome the shortcomings in the design of emu may therefore also foster a stronger international role of the euro the second conclusion is that a stronger global role for the euro may have tangible consequences for the conduct of monetary policy all of which we would need to understand and take into account when designing the common monetary policy for the euro area but provided the right economic policies are adopted a stronger global role of the euro could help facilitate the transmission of monetary policy across euro area financial markets and reduce perilous fragmentation author s

the chinese yuan cny has sharply appreciated against the greenback in the past week wrapping up friday s trade with a high of 6 71 per u s dollar and notching the largest weekly gains since jan 11 analysts and industry insiders believed that market optimism across the board on potential progress to be made in china u s trade relations as well as the long term resilience of the chinese economy has fueled the yuan s rally to pick up steam during the week market optimism on u s china trade relations a principal driver for the yuan hinged on upbeat market expectations and constant updates on this week s trade talks between china and the united states the yuan started to rise on monday after the two sides agreed on feb 15 to hold a new round of economic and trade talks in washington in the past week following the meeting in the previous week in beijing which both sides said had led to some progress an important factor explaining the recent cny appreciation is the increased market confidence on u s china trade talks and the prospects of a trade truce between both countries alejo czerwonko emerging markets strategist at ubs global wealth management told xinhua investors and traders have turned into a risk on sentiment as hopes for easing the lingering trade tensions boosted their appetite for riskier assets that has at the margin reduced demand for the u s dollar as a safe haven currency a weaker dollar has also underpinned the yuan s strength over the week ben randol a senior foreign exchange strategist at bank of america merrill lynch also believed that the global foreign exchange fx market and other asset classes have recently been infused with optimism about a u s china trade deal which has led to a declining tendency in the dollar the more positive progress on u s china trade policy is perceived to be the more strength we see in traditionally riskier currencies such as aud as well as the currencies of more economically open economies such as the euro randol told xinhua the australian dollar aud widely regarded as a barometer of global risk sentiment extended marked gains against the greenback for three days during the week i e tuesday wednesday and friday ending the final trading day at 0 7133 per dollar a sharp increase of 0 75 percent from the previous day some analysts cautioned that a disruption to the trade relationship between china and the united states would roil international economies the trade negotiation between the unites states and china has a direct influence on the currency markets said anthony minardo vice president and fx trader for bank leumi usa there will be a massive increase in currency volatility and large revaluations of global currencies in case of deterioration of trade tensions dovish fed pressuring greenback trade optimism has not been the only relevant factors behind year to date fx moves as global fx markets have already priced in a series of positive updates regarding trade other drivers tend to be longer term and are likely to play a growing role looking ahead the overall dovish tone by the u s federal reserve has recently added pressure on the dollar causing the yuan to strengthen as the market has already factored in the slowdown in future rate paths experts said the dollar index which measures the greenback against six major peers has been sliding on a downward path for four trading days of the past week except thursday the dollar index has turned lower since the start of the week due to one major reason the fed has continued to become more dovish with respect to interest rates in the united states and the pace going forward minardo told xinhua the overall consensus is for rates to remain on hold for the short to medium term and as a result the market has sold the dollar he added the central bank pledged a patient and flexible approach to future policy tightening moves as a way to manage risks while assessing incoming information bearing on the economic outlook according to its latest meeting minutes released on wednesday the fed has decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 25 to 2 5 percent said the minutes of the jan 29 30 policy meeting of the federal open market committee fomc the monetary policy arm of the fed system participants pointed to a variety of considerations that supported a patient approach to monetary policy at this juncture as an appropriate step in managing various risks and uncertainties in the outlook the minutes said these details are dovish in nature and point to the greenback experiencing a gradual depreciation in the coming months on the back of signs of slower economic activity according to czerwonko the ubs strategist january s minutes reveal that several fomc participants were of the view that no more hiking this cycle would be necessary unless inflation were to exceed expectations said czerwonko echoing his concerns blackrock investment institute pointed out in a latest report that the u s economic expansion is shifting into a late cycle phase of the business cycle the final phase before a downturn as fiscal and monetary stimulus is dissipating while the impact of protracted trade tensions is biting back we assess that it will enter the late cycle phase at sometime in the first half of this year elga bartsch chief economist at the institute said thursday while briefing the report themed the global economy and 2019 outlook she noted that the projection was based on analyzing a wide range of u s economic variables including a slowdown in growth gradually increase in wage inflation the employment rate being below the natural rate credit ratio and the savings behavior of the private sector outlook for turnaround in chinese economy asked about the recent yuan appreciation bartsch talked about one factor that could help support the chinese currency in a long term as she believed exchange rates pick up much different information and are always based on a relative basis one thing that might help explain the pattern is the fact that we now know chinese assets will be included in a number of indices in the not so distant future bartsch told xinhua some of that should support the chinese markets and create some inflows into chinese assets international financial information provider bloomberg will include chinese yuan denominated government and policy bank securities into bloomberg barclays global aggregate index starting in april enabling further opening up of china s bonds market the company confirmed on jan 31 chinese bonds will become the fourth largest currency component following the u s dollar euro and japanese yen after full inclusion china s bonds market stood at about 86 trillion yuan about 12 84 trillion u s dollars by the end of 2018 with about 1 8 trillion yuan about 270 billion u s dollars held by global investors up 46 percent year on year we see that the chinese government is taking very decisive steps to stimulate the economy both on the fiscal policy side and on the monetary and financial policy side said bartsch in our view it s just a question of time until this will start to show in the economic data she noted although they held china s economic growth seemed to be decelerating at the moment researchers at blackrock believed there would be a turnaround in the chinese economy with a modest growth re acceleration the chinese economy looks likely to regain its footing in the first half of 2019 said the outlook report co authored by bartsch as policymakers in china have started to moved toward policy easing with efforts to provide economic stimulus while limit financial leverage more specifically bartsch mentioned two main measures i e fiscal policy impulse coming through major tax relief measures to boost revenues and credit impulse to change credit flows with a clear focus on more channels toward small and medium sized companies than state owned enterprises blackrock also expected the people s bank of china or china s central bank to ease its liquidity provisions so as to avoid stoking capital outflows and putting pressure on the yuan exchange rate source xinhua

well as the long term resilience of the chinese economy has fueled the yuan s rally to pick up steam during the week market optimism on u s china trade relations a principal driver for the yuan hinged on upbeat market expectations and constant updates on this week s trade talks between china and the united states the yuan started to rise on monday after the two sides agreed on feb 15 to hold a new round of economic and trade talks in washington in the past week following the meeting in the previous week in beijing which both sides said had led to some progress an important factor explaining the recent cny appreciation is the increased market confidence on u s china trade talks and the prospects of a trade truce between both countries alejo czerwonko emerging markets strategist at ubs global wealth management told xinhua investors and traders have turned into a risk on sentiment as hopes for easing the lingering trade tensions boosted their appetite for riskier assets that has at the margin reduced demand for the u s dollar as a safe haven currency a weaker dollar has also underpinned the yuan s strength over the week ben randol a senior foreign exchange strategist at bank of america merrill lynch also believed that the global foreign exchange fx market and other asset classes have recently been infused with optimism about a u s china trade deal which has led to a declining tendency in the dollar the more positive progress on u s china trade policy is perceived to be the more strength we see in traditionally riskier currencies such as aud as well as the currencies of more economically open economies such as the euro randol told xinhua the australian dollar aud widely regarded as a barometer of global risk sentiment extended marked gains against the greenback for three days during the week i e tuesday wednesday and friday ending the final trading day at 0 7133 per dollar a sharp increase of 0 75 percent from the previous day some analysts cautioned that a disruption to the trade relationship between china and the united states would roil international economies the trade negotiation between the unites states and china has a direct influence on the currency markets said anthony minardo vice president and fx trader for bank leumi usa there will be a massive increase in currency volatility and large revaluations of global currencies in case of deterioration of trade tensions dovish fed pressuring greenback trade optimism has not been the only relevant factors behind year to date fx moves as global fx markets have already priced in a series of positive updates regarding trade other drivers tend to be longer term and are likely to play a growing role looking ahead the overall dovish tone by the u s federal reserve has recently added pressure on the dollar causing the yuan to strengthen as the market has already factored in the slowdown in future rate paths experts said the dollar index which measures the greenback against six major peers has been sliding on a downward path for four trading days of the past week except thursday the dollar index has turned lower since the start of the week due to one major reason the fed has continued to become more dovish with respect to interest rates in the united states and the pace going forward minardo told xinhua the overall consensus is for rates to remain on hold for the short to medium term and as a result the market has sold the dollar he added the central bank pledged a patient and flexible approach to future policy tightening moves as a way to manage risks while assessing incoming information bearing on the economic outlook according to its latest meeting minutes released on wednesday the fed has decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 25 to 2 5 percent said the minutes of the jan 29 30 policy meeting of the federal open market committee fomc the monetary policy arm of the fed system participants pointed to a variety of considerations that supported a patient approach to monetary policy at this juncture as an appropriate step in managing various risks and uncertainties in the outlook the minutes said these details are dovish in nature and point to the greenback experiencing a gradual depreciation in the coming months on the back of signs of slower economic activity according to czerwonko the ubs strategist january s minutes reveal that several fomc participants were of the view that no more hiking this cycle would be necessary unless inflation were to exceed expectations said czerwonko echoing his concerns blackrock investment institute pointed out in a latest report that the u s economic expansion is shifting into a late cycle phase of the business cycle the final phase before a downturn as fiscal and monetary stimulus is dissipating while the impact of protracted trade tensions is biting back we assess that it will enter the late cycle phase at sometime in the first half of this year elga bartsch chief economist at the institute said thursday while briefing the report themed the global economy and 2019 outlook she noted that the projection was based on analyzing a wide range of u s economic variables including a slowdown in growth gradually increase in wage inflation the employment rate being below the natural rate credit ratio and the savings behavior of the private sector outlook for turnaround in chinese economy asked about the recent yuan appreciation bartsch talked about one factor that could help support the chinese currency in a long term as she believed exchange rates pick up much different information and are always based on a relative basis one thing that might help explain the pattern is the fact that we now know chinese assets will be included in a number of indices in the not so distant future bartsch told xinhua some of that should support the chinese markets and create some inflows into chinese assets international financial information provider bloomberg will include chinese yuan denominated government and policy bank securities into bloomberg barclays global aggregate index starting in april enabling further opening up of china s bonds market the company confirmed on jan 31 chinese bonds will become the fourth largest currency component following the u s dollar euro and japanese yen after full inclusion china s bonds market stood at about 86 trillion yuan about 12 84 trillion u s dollars by the end of 2018 with about 1 8 trillion yuan about 270 billion u s dollars held by global investors up 46 percent year on year we see that the chinese government is taking very decisive steps to stimulate the economy both on the fiscal policy side and on the monetary and financial policy side said bartsch in our view it s just a question of time until this will start to show in the economic data she noted although they held china s economic growth seemed to be decelerating at the moment researchers at blackrock believed there would be a turnaround in the chinese economy with a modest growth re acceleration the chinese economy looks likely to regain its footing in the first half of 2019 said the outlook report co authored by bartsch as policymakers in china have started to moved toward policy easing with efforts to provide economic stimulus while limit financial leverage more specifically bartsch mentioned two main measures i e fiscal policy impulse coming through major tax relief measures to boost revenues and credit impulse to change credit flows with a clear focus on more channels toward small and medium sized companies than state owned enterprises blackrock also expected the people s bank of china or china s central bank to ease its liquidity provisions so as to avoid stoking capital outflows and putting pressure on the yuan exchange rate zhang zhongkai in beijing contributed to the report
in light of the ongoing visit to sri lanka by a delegation from the international monetary fund to discuss the resumption of the current lending arrangement the following article analyses sri lanka s relationship with the organisation by adam collins and pabasara kannangara 1 what is the imf the imf is a multilateral international financial institution it promotes the stability of the international monetary and financial systems it is distinct from the world bank which provides financing to support economic and social development the imf was conceived in july 19441 at the united nations bretton woods conference during the closing stages of the second world war the 44 governments represented sought to build a framework for economic cooperation in order to avoid the competitive currency devaluations that contributed to the great depression of the 1930s the imf officially commenced in december 1945 after the first 29 members signed its articles of agreement and began operations in 1947 currently there are 189 member countries who have committed financial resources of 692 billion as of april 2018 2 the imf headquarters are located in washington dc and the institution employs approximately 2 700 people from 150 countries 3 2 the main functions of the imf the imf has the three main functions surveillance capacity building and lending surveillance the imf monitors economic developments in member countries and the global economy in order to identify risks to the stability of the international financial system and recommend appropriate policies bilateral surveillance involves regular visits usually annual 4 to member countries which are known as article iv consultations during these visits imf staff engages government officials and stakeholders in discussions related to local economic and financial developments an article iv consultation report is issued shortly after detailing the findings of the visit the imf s multilateral surveillance involves continuous research by imf staff on emerging economic issues and the publication of several regular reports on global economic trends capacity building imf capacity building involves technical assistance economic institution building and human capacity development training 5 it is provided to strengthen institutional capacity in member countries and is demand driven capacity building assistance is focused on four areas 6 fiscal policy monetary and financial sector policies legal frameworks and statistics lending a member country may request imf financial assistance if there is a lack or potential lack of sufficient foreign currency financing available on affordable terms to meet its net international payments this situation can be triggered by a variety of domestic and external factors in combination or separately the process of obtaining imf financial assistance is as follows after a request for financial support from a member country an imf staff team holds discussions with the government to assess the economic situation typically a country s government and imf staff must then agree on a program of economic policies to be implemented in return for a loan once an understanding has been reached on the terms of the loans and the program of economic policies a recommendation is made to the imf s executive board to extend access to imf resources depending on the type of arrangement this could be in phased instalments or as a single disbursement the majority of imf loans come from the imf s general resources account gra 7 which is funded by subscription charges to member countries the two main lending facilities are stand by arrangements sba which address short term balance of payments problems and the extended fund facility eff which focuses on longer term difficulties with external payments loans are given either on non concessional terms with an interest rate close to market rates or on concessional terms with a zero interest rate for low income countries 3 how is the imf governed imf governance is based on a system of quotas that determine the financial resources each member country must contribute to the organisation how much they can borrow from the imf and their voting power in the imf s decision making bodies the quota of a country is first calculated8 as the weighted average of a country s gross domestic product weight of 50 openness weight of 30 economic variability weight of 15 and international reserves 5 a compression factor is then used to reduce the dispersion in the final quota shares these quotas are expressed in special drawing rights sdr this is an international reserve asset as well as the unit of account used by the imf and other international organisations the imf has three decision making organs the board of governors has a representative from each member country and has the power to appoint members to the executive board suspend membership and amend the imf articles of agreement the executive board has 24 directors and is chaired by the imf managing director in a non voting capacity it is responsible for most formal decisions and has a supervisory role over the managing director and technical staff the managing director is selected by the executive board they have a dual role as a chairman of the executive board and as the head of technical staff the voting power of each country on the imf s board of governors is composed of basic votes and one additional vote for each sdr 100 000 of their quota 9 as a result voting power is skewed in favour of larger and more open economies in addition while the united states japan germany france united kingdom china and saudi arabia have their own permanent directors10 on the executive board the remaining member countries are grouped into constituencies and must agree on a common director 4 critiques of the imf governance structure the governance structure of the imf has been criticised as the voting power is skewed11 towards major european economies and the us see figure 1 this stands in contrast to the united nations and the world trade organization who follow a one nation one vote system this has led to some allegations of excessive political intervention and unfair treatment of some members for example a report done by the independent evaluation office12 of the imf found that during the eurozone crisis some measures were made more favourable to the countries that had greater influence over the organisation s decision making bodies conditionality of lending most imf lending arrangements are conditional on the member country involved agreeing to implement a set of economic policies approved by the imf this is to reduce the risk of default on loan repayments and minimise moral hazard 13 however the conditions imposed by the imf in the past such as sharply reducing government spending have been criticised as it is damaging to social welfare and long term economic development what s more some have called the use of conditions undemocratic due to their imposition by a supranational organisation with a governance structure skewed in favour of a small number of economies 14 5 sri lanka s relationship with the imf sri lanka joined the imf on 29 august 1950 as the organisation s 50th member 15 it currently has a quota of sdr 578 80 million 16 equivalent to around 800 million this gives sri lanka a voting share of 0 14 on the imf s board of governors and it shares a common director18 on the executive board with bangladesh bhutan and india since joining sri lanka has been the recipient of 16 imf loans 19 including the most recent arrangement initiated in june 2016 see table 3 the largest loan was the sba initiated in july 2009 which was worth over 2 5 billion 20 in comparison pakistan has been involved in 21 imf lending arrangements 21 most recently a 6 billion eff agreed in september 2013 of the 15 past lending arrangements the full amount initially agreed was not disbursed on six occasions as sri lanka did not fully comply with the conditions of the loans see lending arrangements 1 6 9 11 13 14 in table 1 the most recent case was the combined eff and extended credit facility agreed in april 2003 which was disrupted by the indian ocean tsunami in december 2004 sri lanka s debt to the imf peaked at 2 5 billion in 2012 22 which was around 5 of the government total debt burden at the time see figure 2 even accounting for the initial disbursements of the ongoing lending arrangement that was initiated in june 2016 debt to the imf only made up around 1 5 of the total government debt at the end of 2018 sri lanka has never failed to repay imf debt on time and has never defaulted 23 the sri lankan government including the central bank have received numerous technical assistance missions24 from the imf since it became a member these have covered areas such as tax administration macroeconomic forecasting the drafting of new income tax legislation financial sector regulations and improving national statistics 6 sri lanka s current imf program on 3 june 2016 the executive board of the imf approved the sri lankan government s request for a 36 month lending arrangement under the eff lending facility 25 this was worth sdr 1 1 billion which was equivalent to around 1 5 billion at the time and was smaller than the lending arrangement agreed in 2009 the sri lankan authorities requested the loan for three reasons 1 to deal with immediate balance of payments pressures prior to its announcement 26 a persistent current account deficit combined with weaker fdi inflows and capital outflows from the local government bond market had contributed to a substantial fall in the sri lanka s foreign exchange reserves this situation was not sustainable and put the government at the risk of being forced to restrict imports as well as default on external government debt repayments due to a lack of foreign currency the loan from the imf directly contributed to raising the country s foreign exchange reserves at an affordable cost 2 to unlock other financing the conditions associated with the lending agreement reinforced the government s policy credibility and at the time of signing was expected to catalyse an additional 650 million27 in other multilateral and bilateral loans 3 to reassure private investors the lending agreement reduced the probability that the government would default on its existing debts and as a result contributed to a fall in the interest rate private investors required the government to pay on its bonds 28 this allowed the government to obtain further financing at a more affordable rate the conditions attached to the current eff29 lending arrangement aim to ensure future macroeconomic stability in particular they focus on raising government revenues in order to reduce the budget deficit and debt burden increasing foreign exchange reserves and improving public finance management following an initial disbursement of around 0 17 billion30 in june 2016 the remainder of the loan was scheduled for release in six semi annual instalments these payments are disbursed based on the government making satisfactory progress in implementing the agreed reforms which is assessed through regular program reviews by the imf on 1 june 2018 the imf executive board completed the fourth semi annual review31 of sri lanka s economic performance under the eff arrangement this enabled the disbursement of sdr 177 7 million around 252 million and brought the total amount disbursed to sdr 715 2 million around 1 014 million at the time of writing the fifth semi annual review was under discussion the final review and disbursement under the current eff arrangement is scheduled to take place in april 2019 32 repayment of the funds borrowed under the arrangement will take place in instalments beginning in 2020 and is expected to be completed by 2028 33 footnotes 1imf 2018 the imf at a glance

as democrats swing left it becomes increasingly difficult to imagine what their triumph in the next election would mean for america the presidential candidates endorse a variety of far reaching proposals that if adopted would represent the largest expansion of government since lyndon b johnson s great society the added spending taxes or deficits could total hundreds of billions are these sound economic policies or partisan pipe dreams let s review the main proposals for context remember the following the u s economy gross domestic product is about 20 trillion so a federal program costing 200 billion would be 1 percent of gdp it would also be about 5 percent of the 4 trillion federal budget here s the rundown a guaranteed jobs program several candidates have proposed creating an employer of last resort to hire anyone who wanted a job but couldn t find one economists at bard college estimated that such a program would initially hire 15 million workers at 15 an hour health insurance and retirement benefits would add 20 percent the initial cost would be around 300 billion annually advertisement medicare for all bernie sanders proposed this and it has become a proxy for almost any proposal that attains universal health insurance coverage its cost is unclear in 2017 there were an estimated 27 million uninsured says a report from politifact of the poynter institute sanders thinks replacing private insurance with medicare could cut expenses other experts disagree there would be pressures to sweeten benefits in a recent new york times column economist paul krugman wrote that we d need a lot more revenue to implement medicare for all the green new deal rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y and sen edward j markey d mass propose putting the country on a war footing to purge u s greenhouse gas emissions over a decade the costs aren t known because the new deal manifesto contains no concrete proposals however it must be sweeping and expensive if the government is to subsidize clean energy and suppress fossil fuels everything else there are smaller proposals that in other years would seem large sen elizabeth warren d mass backs subsidies for child care at an annual cost of 70 billion sanders would provide free tuition at state colleges and universities for most students that s perhaps 50 billion then there s infrastructure spending more billions and a proposal to raise social security benefits advertisement counting plausible costs from programs without official estimates the total could easily equal the existing budget deficit 779 billion in 2018 the actual amount could be more or less no one really knows how would democrats pay for this some spending would be offset by taxes on the wealthy krugman doubts these would suffice adopting any major health proposals would probably require sizable increases in payroll taxes and or a value added tax that hit the middle class he writes of course there is another choice more deficit spending last week i tried to educate myself on so called modern money theory embraced by some democrats its central thesis seems to be that deficits are not nearly as dangerous as we ve been led to believe here s the case for that view as best i can determine advertisement the biggest mistake we make is thinking the federal government as a household that has to repay its debt says stephanie kelton an economist at stony brook university and an adviser in 2016 to sanders the united states won t default on its governmental debts because it can always create more dollars through the federal reserve to honor u s treasury bonds and bills kelton says she rejects the argument that the fed might generate inflation by flooding the economy with too much money to prevent that inflationary pressures can be offset through higher taxes and interest rates just as occurs today share this article share the obsession with controlling government deficits hinders us in stabilizing the economy and promoting maximum employment she contends this may or may not be good economics but it s certainly expedient no one likes to raise taxes and cut spending and that may explain why benign neglect of deficits is now going mainstream advertisement check out the latest issue of foreign affairs washington should end its debt obsession urge lawrence h summers and jason furman top economic officials in the clinton and obama administrations interest rates are low it s better to borrow and spend on education health care and infrastructure what s missing from this picture is old fashioned prudence true the government doesn t have to default on its debt in a legal sense but if financial markets worry about the escalating debt treasury bonds will lose value if the fall in confidence is great enough it might trigger a

the new york federal reserve recently sent out an early valentine s day present to a certain group of individuals however this gift wasn t to overleveraged american consumers but rather to those who are employed repossessing one of those goodies they can t afford on february 12th the ny fed made the announcement that a record number of consumers are falling behind on their car payments there are now over 7 million car loans past due by at least 90 days as of q4 2018 along with a record 89 million loans that are outstanding for subprime auto borrowers with credit scores below 620 the delinquency rate spiked to over 16 percent and the number of subprime borrowers jumped to 20 percent of loans outstanding the amount of overdue loans has spiked by 1 3 million since its previous high set in 2011 when the unemployment rate was at 9 percent click to enlarge the total market for auto loans now stands at 1 2 trillion some may take solace in the fact this level is much smaller than the 9 trillion home mortgage market that brought down the global economy in 2008 however when you combine car loans with all the other debt consumers have accumulated due to the fed s nearly decade long zero interest rate policy the numbers become daunting household debt is now at an all time record high of 13 5 trillion this number includes a record 1 trillion in c c loans and 1 5 trillion of student loan debt and while that 9 trillion mortgage market isn t in as bad shape as it was a decade ago home prices have climbed back into an echo bubble and have become extremely susceptible to rising interest rates and the credit cycle in addition when you add in the boom in corporate credit rising from 6 trillion in 08 to 9 6 trillion today along with the 22 trillion national debt you can clearly see the state of the us consumer has never been more precarious in fact these debt holders are desperately clinging to their jobs and hoping the economy avoids even a mild contraction in growth or any further advance in debt service payment costs considering all of these mindboggling obligations owed by consumers and taxpayers is it really much of a mystery as to why the fed is so panicked about even the slightest hint of a recession related gold inches upward on dollar weakness a recent federal reserve survey also reported that 40 percent of american adults say they couldn t produce 400 in an emergency without sliding into debt or selling some assets that is if they have any to sell in the first place the state of the us economy and indeed that of the entire globe now depends upon the conditions of zirp and asset bubbles that are made permanent this shouldn t be a shocking conclusion after all central banks wanted to re leverage the economy after the great recession hit in 2008 and concluded the only way to accomplish this was to make money virtually free for the past 10 years of course one of the consequences from manipulating the cost of money in such an unprecedented manner was to force buyers into new vehicles at record numbers this in turn drove the price of new vehicles to record highs while it also significantly raised the residual values of new auto leases and thus made monthly payments much more affordable as long as zero percent financing was available to those with lower and lower credit ratings the bull market in car sales and prices continued however much like what occurred at the apex of the real estate bubble circa 2006 all bubbles inevitably pop auto prices eventually increased to a level that became unaffordable to most buyers dealers ran out of subprime borrowers and the central bank began to normalize monetary policy and then the car market goes into reverse as the economy slows due to the inevitable turn in the business cycle what follows is a huge number of cars start heading back to the dealership think jingle mail 2 0 but with car keys instead of front door keys causing the price of used vehicles to drop sharply this in turn causes residual lease values to plummet and as a consequence the cost of new leases begins to surge related gold jewelry fuels 20 billion valentine s spending spree the collapse of the auto bubble happens to be just one small example of the unintended consequences and massive distortions created by central banks gone rogue economic growth has slowed from 4 2 percent in q2 of last year to just 1 5 percent in q4 estimated by the atlanta fed as the u s economy continues to slow and the global economy waxes towards recession what is happening in the auto sector should also occur with student loans credit card debt mortgage backed securities leveraged loans clo s and so on of course banks are the primary holders of all this debt and their balance sheets will once again become an issue in 2019 2020 the next recession will cause tax receipts to plunge and push annual deficits to spike above 2 trillion or an incredible 10 percent of gdp adding another two trillion dollars per year to an already unmanageable 22 trillion national debt is not something our bond market or world s reserve currency can easily withstand in other words the ustaxpayerr will be required

during the lease term the right of use asset lessees are required to separately recognize the interest expense on the lease liability and the depreciation expense on the right of use asset lessees are also required to remeasure the lease liability upon the occurrence of certain events i e a change in the lease term a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payments the lessee will generally recognize the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right of use asset in addition for leases denominated in

an economic postcard from malaysia not so long ago malaysia was set to lose years of economic progress today following the re imposition of economic discipline the country is almost back on track a new era dawned in malaysia in may 2018 when the opposition coalition led by dr mahathir mohamad and anwar ibrahim secured a simple majority in a historical election when mahathir will return to retirement opposition leader anwar is expected to replace him in about two years in the 2018 election their coalition pakatan harapan ph won 113 seats against the ruling coalition united malays national organization umno and its allies that had not lost an election since 1957 last year malaysia s economy grew 4 7 year on year despite fiscal consolidation and challenging international conditions the country is set to sustain its growth path in 2019 it is an extraordinary achievement after years of political turmoil the najib regression as the sixth prime minister of malaysia najib razak ruled the country from 2009 to 2018 his early tenure was marked by economic liberalization measures including cuts to government subsidies loosening of foreign investment restrictions and reductions in preferential measures for ethnic malays in business after the 2013 election the neoliberal economic policies gave way to greater efforts at political consolidation including the pursuit of critics on sedition charges the imprisonment of opposition leader anwar ibrahim the implementation of a consumption tax gst and the embarrassing scandal involving state investment firm 1malaysia development berhad 1mdb that s when malaysia lost its economic discipline the changing fortunes can be illustrated by the fluctuations of malaysian ringgit between 2009 and 2013 us dollar was still about 3 3 60 myr as economic prospects weakened so did the ringgit between 2013 and 2018 us dollar amounted to 4 40 myr figure figure malaysian ringgit 2009 2019 eventually the massive 1mdb corruption debacle led to rallies calling for najib s resignation spearheaded by the grassroots movement bersih following his release in 2004 anwar ibrahim became the leading figure in the opposition and helped coalesce the opposition parties into the pakatan rakyat which contested the 2008 and 2013 general elections these protests culminated in the malaysian citizens declaration by mahathir the rise of pakatan harapan and ngos to oust najib the 2018 election triumph paved the way to mahathir to become the world s oldest elected leader at 93 he said his coalition would not seek revenge but would restore the rule of law recently anwar ibrahim seconded those views he said malaysia will not compromise in its talks with goldman sachs over the 1mdb corruption scandal and the bank must bear responsibility the nation has a responsibility to uncover any crimes the investment bank may have committed fiscal consolidation between 1974 and 2004 mahathir s malaysia experienced a period of rapid modernization and economic growth as his government initiated a series of bold infrastructure projects during his reign malaysia was transformed into an asean tiger politically mahathir was dominant winning five consecutive general elections and fending off a series of rivals for the leadership of umno the final test came with the aftermath of the asian financial crisis in 1998 while much of asia succumbed to imf imposed austerity malaysia did not instead mahathir pursued a heterodox model of economic policies including currency and capital controls while deterring george soros s speculative efforts to derail the economy in the west mahathir was demonized as an authoritarian dictator who was intent on undermining his own economy in reality his mix of policies ultimately helped malaysia endure a shallower gdp loss than crisis afflicted indonesia south korea and thailand now mahathir s objective is fiscal consolidation to surpass the policy mistakes of the najib years while stabilizing a more robust growth path it is a challenging task that must be implemented amid america s new protectionism and u s tariff wars moreover mahathir has had to suspend several multibillion dollar projects including china backed initiatives in a bid to target malaysia s estimated 250 billion national debt and other liabilities early signs are promising in 2019 economic growth is likely to be around 4 5 in 2020 4 2 private consumption is the key contributor as consumers have loosened their purse strings amid an improving labor market and lower consumption tax however investment growth is lingering as several high profile projects have been put on the back burner following the new government s fiscal rationalization preparing for 2020 contingencies as the new government s first budget suggests the focus is on institutional reforms improving the standards of living particularly for the lower income groups as well as encouraging entrepreneurship the fiscal deficit is projected to narrow to 3 0 of gdp by 2020 and to 2 0 in the medium term it is a typical mahathir mix people first good governance self sufficiency but openness to international trade and investment yet there are two key risks to the fiscal target forecast on the one hand growth could be less than anticipated thanks to the challenging external environment on the other hand revenue flows could prove more volatile than expected given the higher dependence on oil related revenues which account for almost a third of total while the government s expansionary efforts are limited by the ongoing fiscal consolidation malaysia can still rely on more accommodative monetary policy in 2019 monetary policy is expected to be stable as international headwinds are likely to escalate in 2020 the central bank could opt for a more dovish stance until recently neoliberal policies have often been portrayed as natural for post industrializing asia in reality such policies tend to boost oligarchs and shun the rule of law led by dr mahathir mohamad and anwar ibrahim malaysia s political reset shows that neoliberal trajectory and corruption are not an inevitable destiny malaysians deserve a

former us federal reserve chair janet yellen refuting the trump administration s allegations that china is a currency manipulator wants american trade negotiators to think twice about asking china to maintain a stable exchange rate between the yuan and the us dollar as it is difficult and treacherous to define when a country is manipulating its currency central banks need to be able to use all policy levers including the exchange rate to meet domestic economic needs yellen told a brookings institution podcast warning the us trade negotiation team not to define policy tools as currency manipulation the us has insisted that china keep the yuan exchange rate stable as a condition for ending the trade war to prevent it from using devaluation to offset the effects of american trade tariffs bloomberg reported this week that call was in harmony with washington s long time insistence that china adopt a market oriented exchange rate system so that the yuan can find its fair value against the us dollar the us and the other industrial nations that make up the g7 have for years defined currency manipulation as directly intervening in the foreign exchange market to alter a currency s value to improve a country s international competitive position and trade flows but yellen said countries should be allowed to use key macroeconomic policy levers including the exchange rate to achieve domestic policy goals regarding price stability and full employment monetary policy does have a systematic effect on a country s exchange rate but nevertheless i think that it s widely agreed that it should be available to be used for domestic purposes the former fed chief said so we would want to be careful not to define domestic policy tools as currency manipulation some tools that central banks used to help stabilise their economies inevitably weakened their currencies she said a reuters report on thursday that the us and china had started to draw up six memorandums of understanding to cover trade issues including currency policy raised expectations that china would agree to maintain a stable yuan and sent the yuan traded in china to its strongest level in seven months the yuan pared its gains to trade at 6 6879 on friday ing bank greater china economist iris pang said the unwritten understanding of any agreement in the memorandums of understanding could be for the people s bank of china pboc to keep the yuan at south of seven to the us dollar such an agreement would prevent china from devaluing its way out of a sharp narrowing in its trade balance she said in an interview the yuan fell by as much as 8 per cent against the dollar last year raising us treasury suspicions that the drop was not entirely market led pang said lu ting chief china economist at nomura said that a stable yuan dollar exchange rate could result in an increasingly overvalued yuan which would slow chinese export growth and increase the country s account deficit as exports weakened from an overvalued currency china could be forced to further loosen its monetary policy to stimulate the economy pushing asset price bubbles to unsustainable levels he said china should learn from japan s mistakes in the late 1980s and early 1990s when it allowed an asset price bubble consisting of greatly inflated property and stock market prices to burst causing its economy to stagnate lu said given the sharp divergence between gdp growth rates inflation rates monetary policies and other socioeconomic characteristics the best exchange rate policy for both china and the us is to further de peg the yuan from the dollar and encourage beijing to further reform its exchange rate regime towards a free floating one he said on thursday chinese premier li keqiang highlighted a concern over the impact of beijing s recent monetary easing measures warning of the new potential risks created by a record level of new loans in january credit easing could trigger a resurgence in speculative financial activity that would not benefit the real economy and could potentially put the financial system at risk he said the pboc said new yuan loans in january almost tripled from the previous month to 3 23 trillion yuan us 480 8 billion or 5 5 per cent higher than the 3 06 trillion yuan reported in january 2018 however in its quarterly report published late on thursday the central bank said it did not have a lot of room to manoeuvre on policy according to research firm trivium china that suggests the pboc will not launch a major monetary stimulus this year china s central bank said it considers the country s interest rates to be at a relatively low level amid rising financing costs abroad pushing back against market expectations of an imminent cut in benchmark rates it said source south china morning post
we have a little game we like to play well kai likes to play called what is janet yellen thinking in five words we will find out when she testifies before the house financial services committee tomorrow but for now here s what several economists had to say did i make a mistake in raising rates gad levanon managing director of macroeconomic and labor market research at the conference board his answer which he also thinks is yellen s answer fyi is i don t think so markets need a deep breath sameer samana global quantitative strategist at wells fargo investment institute overall doing well markets concerning richard dekaser corporate economist at wells fargo company yellen s fed is data dependent samana says and she is likely to point to a lot of data showing the markets are not the economy you ve got a labor market that s pretty healthy you ve got additional wage gains inflation that s pretty benign a housing market that continues to rebound from crisis lows you ve got consumer sentiment that s still at a pretty good level markets are upset about corporate profits which aren t so good said the conference board s levanon but that s different from the economy this turbulence will pass yellen may also point out to congress that the fed s own models show the chances of recession in 2016 are about three to five percent according to dekaser but the sticky sense of gloom on wall street is certainly on the mind of yellen and her compatriots at the fed i have no doubt said debaser that within the federal reserve there s a vigorous debate about the extent to which monetary policy needs to be suboordinate or subservient to markets on the one hand markets do influence the economy but on the other the fed can t bail out investors just because they re having a bad time decision makers at the fed don t want to basically underwrite portfolio managers he said in all likelihood these economists said the fed may give it a few more months before raising rates again

good for movies but not for the consumer every good western movie has an old fashioned showdown following a conflict everyone is out in the street drawing their six shooters and it ends with dramatic results while this is a winning formula for cinema the last thing we look forward to in global economics is a showdown economic showdowns can negatively impact growth stock prices and inflation today there are several global economic issues and conflicts that could lead to a shoot out some have a short term impact while others have a longer term impact that will ultimately lead to an economic slowdown in the u s trade tensions as we start 2019 trade tensions dominate the headlines will the trade showdown lead to a trade war a history lesson may give us clues as to what a trade war looks like and the impact it would have on the economy tariffs which protect specific industries have been part of u s history since our nation was founded the most punitive tariffs were put in place in 1930 when president hoover passed the smoot hawley act this act placed an approximate 60 percent tariff on a broad basket of products and caused dozens of countries to retaliate u s exports and imports to and from europe declined by 66 percent between 1929 and 1932 tariffs added to the already strained economy and prolonged the depression today u s tariffs are among the lowest in the world consider the following points of comparison according to the world bank the average u s import tariff across all products is 1 6 percent compared with china s average tariff of 3 5 percent and mexico s average tariff of 4 4 percent the u s has only a 2 5 percent duty on imported automobiles from europe and china europe has a 10 percent duty on automobiles imported from the u s china recently cut the tariff on u s cars from 25 percent to 15 percent with these numbers in mind it can be difficult to see free trade or even fair trade let the showdown begin this may lead to a slowdown in global growth if not resolved tariffs will increase prices leading to margin pressure on corporate america and inflation for the consumer tight labor market another showdown looming is the challenge that a tight labor market brings according to the national federation of independent businesses two of the top concerns small business owners have are finding workers and the quality of workers with unemployment at 3 9 percent the labor market is tight and if businesses can t find workers economic activity may slow while wages will continue to increase over the past nine years business has been good the economy has expanded at an average growth rate of 2 2 percent the economy can continue expanding if there is labor force growth and productivity gains but neither of these are increasing significantly labor force growth in the past year is a paltry 1 3 percent and productivity gains are up a mere 1 3 percent if businesses can t find workers and there are limited productivity gains economic growth will slow average hourly earnings are up 3 2 percent year over year this is good for workers as they have more discretionary income it can be challenging for companies however as the rising wages also increase their costs if wages go up in a stagnant to slowing economy it becomes difficult for companies to cover costs let alone grow wage inflation can be a significant driver of overall inflation something the federal reserve is watching closely the fed the fed may get a bad rap it is blamed for ending economic expansions by increasing interest rates too fast or too much in late 2018 data showed the economy was slowing but the fed communicated a steady as she goes policy as a result the dow jones industrial average sold off sharply on oct 10 down 831 points and again on dec 19 tumbling 348 points all due to the threat of higher interest rates in january 2019 however the fed said it will be patient and data dependent this sent the stock market up 747 points and the risk of a showdown dissipated it is quite clear that the uncertainty around the fed s monetary policy continues to be a risk in previous economic cycles the fed raised rates well over the neutral interest rate which is the rate at which real gross domestic product gdp is growing at its trend rate and inflation is stable many think raising rates over the neutral interest rate is what ended previous economic expansions in 2019 we expect gdp to grow very close to trend gdp and in the last half of 2018 inflation using the consumer price index as a barometer decreased the fed suggests that the neutral rate is around 2 8 percent therefore we forecast a one and done fed hike in 2019 if this happens the current economic expansion will continue through 2019 pennsylvania avenue we will experience several politically based showdowns this year government shutdowns are not new as presidents carter reagan bush clinton and obama all had periods of government shutdowns economic activity slows down when the government is shut down we estimate that gdp is reduced by 0 10 percent each week the government is closed first quarter gdp growth could be cut in half or reduced to zero if the shutdown lingers which may cause us to reduce our annual gdp forecast another potential showdown in washington d c is the expanding fiscal deficit and our national debt typically the budget deficit is going down late in an economic cycle which makes sense business is good unemployment is down and tax revenue is up so the deficit shrinks but not this time around business is good unemployment is down yet the budget deficit is getting larger and that means our national debt continues to grow this showdown will likely be political rhetoric this year but becomes a very serious economic showdown in years to come academic research looks specifically at the relationship between net debt which is total debt minus intra government owned debt and gdp studies argue that if a country has more than 90 percent net debt to gdp ratio it cannot experience economic growth greater than 2 percent this appears to be true for japan and italy which each have well over 100 percent net debt to gdp ratio both countries have grown their economies about 1 3 percent annually over the past three years today the u s has 78 percent net debt to gdp ratio it s getting larger and may be a future showdown to keep an eye on showdown to slowdown economic forecast the global theme has changed moving from synchronized global growth to synchronized global slowdown the fundamentals in the u s are slowing but only back to trend growth we expect gdp growth to be between 2 and 2 4 percent in 2019 a slowdown from 2018 this is not a negative theme if directionally correct the u s economy will set the record for the longest expansion in history in july 2019 in addition 2 to 2 4 percent growth will allow companies to be profitable and individuals to increase consumption equity expectations an expanding economy should provide a positive backdrop for revenue and earnings growth we forecast 7 percent earnings growth in 2019 the dramatic market sell off in the fourth quarter created an oversold posture because of this opportunity we anticipate 10 to 12 percent total returns in equites and the s p 500 ending the year at 2800 keep in mind the market climbs a wall of worry today there are plenty of things to worry about fixed income outlook we expect the fed to hike rates only once in 2019 moving short rates to 2 75 percent by year end due to the lack of inflation expectations we anticipate the yield curve will remain relatively flat and the 10 year treasury yield should finish the year around 3 1 percent riding into the sunset as these showdowns escalate confidence weakens and may have a temporary impact on economic activity history tells us however that many of these showdowns are not new often they are resolved and the impact on the economy is manageable no doubt there will be volatility due to these showdowns but overall current data suggests another year of moderate gdp growth
a handout photo made available by gcis shows soth african minister of finance tito mboweni presenting his 2019 budget speech during the plenary of the national assembly of parliament cape town south africa 20 february 2019 the local currency the rand gained on the positive speech epa efe elmond jiyane gcis handout handout editorial use only no sales south africa is establishing a tradition of bringing in to parliament symbolic plants or agricultural produce former minister trevor manuel gave plums to mps present finance minister tito mboweni brandished an aloe aloe ferox in a pot in giving his budget speech mboweni pointed out the plant had a long history of medicinal use it is resilient sturdy and drought resistant in other words it was symbolic of a hard times budget not the first we ve seen in recent years it was indeed a tough budget with stealth tax and fuel tax increases on the one hand and cuts to the public service wage bill on the other looking at that plant i remembered a line from athol fugard s play a lesson from aloes in the play the main protagonist piet an aloe collector is concerned the roots of one of his beloved plants confined in a tin are going to crawl around inside and tie themselves into knots looking for the space creation intended for them perhaps that s the real metaphor for the budget it is too married to ideas of containment to be healthy at a time when economists are rethinking the role of fiscal policy ie tax and spending to spur the economy by increasing demand for goods and services and the ideas of john maynard keynes seem poised for some revival flirting with austerity seems wrong keynes believed that governments should not as they did during the great depression aim for balanced budgets but borrow to inject money into the economy keynesian multiplier theory says any government spending brings about a virtuous circle of spending as the person employed with government money uses that money to pay the baker who pays the grocer etc creating increased employment and prosperity a rand of government spending generates more than a rand in economic growth as it cycles again and again through the economy to rephrase investopedia on the topic in the short term it is a powerful way of getting a stagnant economy to grow by using deficit financing that is borrowing to finance the gap between revenue and spending the central bank in our case the reserve bank can also stimulate the economy by using monetary policy i e lowering interest rates if instead the reserve bank raises rates this might cancel out the fiscal stimulus so there must be co ordination governments should do the opposite to cool down an economy raise taxes and interest rates and cut government spending even former us treasury secretary larry summers has revived the idea in an article in foreign affairs of not ignoring fiscal policy as a tool to stimulate the economy and accused washington of being obsessed with debt on our home turf the idea of using fiscal policy as a stimulatory measure did not even come up in the budget which focuses on structural reforms and greater private sector involvement in service delivery to grow the economy for some time in mainstream economic circles fiscal policy has been regarded as of little use in managing demand in the economy particularly as it takes time to manifest its benefits vishnu paddaychee a professor in the school of economic business sciences at wits university believes the times are changing that treasury is stuck in the early 90s with a local version of the washington consensus and that fiscal policy co ordinated with monetary policy should be used to manage demand in an economy he has written a paper beyond a treasury view of the world expanding on the heterodox world view which would support a more active fiscal policy against the background of treasury s conservative thinking it should not have been a surprise that the public sector wage bill was cut the medium term budget policy statement mtbps in october last year set the stage with an annexure devoted to public servant wages in that annexure the treasury pointed out compensation of public servants was one of the fastest growing items in the budget increasing on average by 11 2 a year it added that the rising wage bill means lower budgets for goods and services and capital expenditure the brutal arithmetic is that to maintain the kind of increases in compensation that have been the trend the number of public servants would have to drop and continue dropping as in the private companies one way of paying higher salaries is to pay those to fewer people worrying that wages will eat up the entire discretionary spending on infrastructure and the like in the budget is not controversial paddaychee for instance actually backs curbing the public sector wage bill so that money can be diverted to capital spending nonetheless it is of concern that while the mtbps discussed various aspects of the public sector wage bill in detail quality was not considered at least not overtly for instance complaints about the quality of teaching in township schools are legendary but focusing simply on the number of teachers rather than their knowledge and commitment will not change matters it has been pointed out that most public servants are not pen pushers but teachers nurses doctors police and those running the justice system nor does the number of public servants befit the adjective bloated at 8 of the country s workforce it seems to be ironic that some people clamouring for early arrests of those accused of corruption would want fewer lawyers and for public servants who are part of the justice system to be put out of work the budget promises to offer early retirement to public servants this way it expects to replace 30 000 or so older workers with younger cheaper public servants the prospect of losing workers with valuable experience and ability as voluntary retrenchment tends to do is not discussed while the budget stance seems contractionary in its cutting public sector wages spending does increase over the next three years according to the budget review real or inflation adjusted spending grows by on average 2 a year after the cost of paying interest on the debt is stripped out this is better than a decline but is that enough a keynesian point of departure would be to cut taxes and raise spending during recessionary periods south africa is not actually in a recession though it might as well be growth is forecast to be below 1 for last year we tend to track the slower growing developed world in our growth path rather than the faster growing developing nations but recently the gap between our growth and the developed world has been increasing at the same time the south african reserve bank most recently announced an increase in the repo rate the interest rate that influences all other rates monetary policy if not contractionary is not expansionary either especially when the interest rates actually paid on loans is taken into account the gap between the repo rate at 6 75 and the prime rate the rate banks supposedly charge their best customers is 3 5 percentage points a gap the banks stick to and the wideness of which mboweni questioned when he was reserve bank governor so how much room do we have to manoeuvre according to some voices the rating agencies are just waiting to downgrade their credit ratings on our sovereign bonds leading to higher interest on new debt there is panic about the public debt to gdp ratio that our public debt measured as a percentage of gross domestic product the output based measure of an economy s performance the budget predicts that the gross debt to gdp ratio now around 55 will climb to around 60 of gdp by 2023 24 yet at 60 there is still room to increase spending and therefore debt even for conservative economists three economists in a world bank working paper estimate the tipping point for debt to have an adverse effect on economic growth to be above a threshold of 77 for developed economies and 64 for emerging markets however they state the loss for each percentage point above 64 for emerging market countries is around 0 02 percentage points it s worth remembering that the debt to gdp ratio for the us is now 106 economic growth has to be much higher if we are to make any dent on unemployment and we may well need much greater fiscal and monetary stimulus what is possible depends on local politics and global financial forces but we must at least debate the options so perhaps an aloe was the correct choice of flora if it was on the point of withering if the budget had been more expansionary a flowering plant or even a bouquet of flowers or maybe a bag of fertiliser would have been more appropriate and here s another tip for tito instead of quoting charles dickens or the bible use one of the great keynes quotes like this one the difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones dm reg rumney is the former director of the sa reserve bank centre for economics journalism at rhodes university and former head of the economics department at the

the united states business expansion cycle may turn out to be the longest economic expansion in history after june this year marie owens thomsen global chief economist of indosuez wealth management is convinced that the business cycle is not running out of steam due to low inflation with low inflation we get real wage gains with real wage gains we get consumption growth and as long as we have consumption growth it s hard to forecast a recession again owens thomsen says investors have been worried about a recession as many believe that an inverted yield curve would herald a contraction owens thomsen believes that the federal reserve can control the yield curve by quantitative easing and quantitative tightening she says the business cycle is getting longer as the service economy s proportion of global gdp is increasing the service economy is 64 percent of global gdp today it s about 80 percent of organization for economic co operation and development oecd countries gdp owens thomsen says basically all economies are majority wise in services and services have experienced very few recessions since the second world war the recessions are mainly taking place in the manufacturing sector indosuez wealth management expects a mild deceleration in the global business cycle the global gdp we saw in 2017 reached 3 6 percent in 2018 we think it will end at 3 4 percent and in 2019 we think perhaps 3 2 percent and next year perhaps 3 percent owens thomsen says we are still in line with the potential gdp growth this is decent growth by any absolute standard she says noting that 3 5 percent is the 30 year average world gdp and potential growth is between 3 percent and 3 5 percent for the world economy as long as growth in trade volumes remains positive recession fears should be held at bay indosuez wealth management says in a report at present trade volumes are still growing albeit at a slower pace the world trade organization s quarterly outlook indicator of global world merchandise slumped to the weakest since march 2010 last week the wto also forecast last september that global trade growth would slow to 3 7 percent this year from an estimated 3 9 percent in 2018 however indosuez wealth management warns of historic high global debt that has reached us 164 trillion hk 1 28 quadrillion the global debt ratio has hit 225 percent of world gdp the world s top three borrowers the us china and japan account for 56 percent of global debt the us has issued a third of the world s outstanding sovereign debt the size of the debt in the world today is such that we can no longer ignore it when we are setting monetary policy owens thomsen says china stands for three quarters of the increase in private debt but she believes china will not run the risk of a currency crisis like argentina and turkey argentina and turkey already experienced a crisis as most of their debt was in foreign currency and had short maturities she says china is uniquely protected because it is 95 percent domestic currency china still has us 3 trillion worth of foreign exchange reserves so they can just pay for everybody if they had to that would be ugly but you know it would still be possible given the debt burden investors have to pay more attention to the credit quality of countries and for companies credit quality and solid balance sheets are essential for both stocks and bonds she says diversification is becoming more important if we anticipate higher default rates commenting on opinions about an earnings recession owens thomsen says it isnot such a scenario from the macro point of view if we think that the world economy is growing 3 5 percent say roughly and then we have 2 percent inflation so that should mean 5 percent or so earnings growth this year for global equity markets she says and if the us performs in a positive territory this year then there is room for in particular emerging markets to outperform we think that china will do well she says if we split up the 3 4 percent gdp growth of last year in terms of percentage points 1 2 comes from china 0 8 comes from india 0 3 comes from the us and 0 2 comes from europe given those numbers it s hard for any international portfolio to be completely absent from china and india because these are the main growth engines however owens thomsen is not bullish on yuan a number of years ago the chinese current account surplus was 10 percent of gdp and now it s basically zero so something that used to be a very fundamental supporting factor for the yuan is sort of gone into neutral we believe that this central bank doesn t want a particularly weak currency because that would cause problems with capital outflows potentially but if the central bank has to choose between the currency and liberalizing the capital account we believe it will choose the currency she says
what comes after a peace declaration with north korea and can it salvage the country s economy expectations about the upcoming u s north korea hanoi summit centre on a simple assumption a peace declaration between the united states and north korea will bring stability and economic development to the whole region trump more than anyone else seems to believe this does this hypothesis hold water after a peace declaration can north korea simply be re integrated within the east asia region and become prosperous to answer this question the trump administration should have looked at the state of the north korean economy long before the first summit in singapore they would have seen a country that has survived on international aid for its entire existence a unicum among industrialized societies there is debate on whether north korea has slowly grown inured to aid since the 1990s or it deliberately stalled economic development to concentrate resources on its military but there is consensus on its enduring long term need for aid a peace declaration seems one of the possible outcomes of the summit yet how can north korea and the u s envision peace without solving this issue a tentative answer should first look at why north korea is still so poor after decades of assistance critics of international aid to the dprk argue that aid is either disproportionate it supports the regime or is diverted by it is this the case has the dprk received a disproportionate amount of aid allowing the regime to squander international funds to test this notion we will first see how much money effectively went to the dprk using three sets of figures the international aid transparency initiative iati reports 1 45 billion in aid went to the dprk from 2001 to 2018 this figure does not include other important aid sources such as aid allocated and disbursed before 2001 economic assistance from south korea and other international contributions that may simply have not been reported to the voluntary iati mechanism the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs unocha reports a figure of 2 08 billion since 1996 and the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd data reports 1 62 billion from 1995 to 2016 the following graph compares the amount of official development assistance oda north korea received since the mid 1990s to data from other states these states are others that have either been associated to north korea in antagonizing the united states the axis of evil of bush fame are associated with terrorism or were at war with the united states the second graph looks at north korea in relation to other countries in asia that shared a socialist economy or have been the recipients of significant aid packages the picture is clear north korea received much less than other countries sometimes classified as rogue or underdeveloped a different issue is whether this aid was put to good use previous analysis has argued that the potential for diversion is in fact quite small another viewpoint maintains that even if this is true aid provides the regime with a way of opting out of socioeconomic development these debates are useful but two core points must be clarified the first is that the north korean economy was already on a downward trajectory by the mid 1980s the second is that starting with the 1995 crisis aid to north korea was intended to be humanitarian that is for life saving relief purposes development or improvement of structural factors was never thoroughly addressed when the united nations accessed the dprk in 1995 north korea was not involved in any active conflict the government had a de jure commitment to core un values of the development since the 1980s and could boast several achievements in childcare maternity and literacy even in 2014 an independent review of the un central emergency response fund cerf activities in the dprk determined north korea was not a poor country in major crisis but rather isolated politically and economically at the same time the review suggested that north korea s aggressive behaviour brought on increasing sanctions and barriers to development the pre 1995 un documentation foresaw grounds for capacity building and development cooperation with the dprk government the country appeared to have reached satisfactory levels in many of the developmental standards set by the un around 1990 up to the summer of 1993 there were no reports of malnutrition it is unsurprising then that when un agencies took residence in the country in 1995 and gradually mapped the extent of the crisis they were forced to play catch up aid to north korea has since been characterized by ad hoc interventions limited access and partial cooperation on part of the dprk government first there was the famine and the breakdown of the public distribution system pds 1994 1998 this was followed by climatic emergencies including droughts floods and hailstorms 1995 2000 these events spurred increasing environmental vulnerability and north korea experienced the recurrence 2003 2006 2011 2016 2017 of one or a combination of these events in the decades since the famine humanitarian response has compounded from a series of short term relief efforts into a long term international aid presence while north korea entered an increasingly restrictive regime of sanctions since its nuclear tests of 2006 resident un agencies in the dprk have established a number of frameworks to maximize aid efficiency and take a more holistic approach however these frameworks do not adequately address the fact that the north korean economy needs profound systemic changes and those can only come from bold political decisions which are nowhere in sight at the moment can a peace declaration solve aid dependency peace in the dprk should hopefully be accompanied by an adequate degree of economic growth and an end to aid dependency without this a disarmed north korea risks grave political instability having relinquished its main source of legitimacy its nuclear arsenal which will bring human insecurity and continued vulnerability aid efforts in the dprk so far have been strictly humanitarian there has been little to no effect of aid on the north korean gdp the prolonged inability to raise people s livelihood in north korea should ring an alarm bell for the trump administration historical and current gross domestic product gdp figures indicate severe stagnation since the late 1970s in this scenario building trump branded condos and hotels on north korean beaches is at best a fanciful dream it is troubling that u s negotiators have not yet addressed this point in detail but it is also a difficult area to navigate given the discrepancy among various sources the graphic below shows how divergent estimates of north korean gdp can be there are figures declared by the dprk others collected by external actors figures given as gdp or gross national income gni variations of per capita and purchasing power parity ppp and finally differences in currencies some old estimates used north korean won other used current or constant dollars and others south korean won for example the gdp reported by the dprk government in a unesco publication for 1979 80 was 1170 the same year the un statistical division unsd reported a figure of 680 that based on data provided directly by the dprk central bureau of statistics kim il sung himself in his new year s 1980 address declared a whopping 1920 when the famine was officially addressed by the north korean government in 1995 gdp figures were given at 222 unsd 1034 bank of korea 590 undp dprk and 719 dprk government later recalibrated to 239 in 1997 and reported by economist nicholas eberstadt in his 2007 book about the north korean economy in more recent years un agencies report figures that are just above the 1000 mark 1013 in 2013 the bank of korea gives an average of 1200 in the last five years two concepts should be of key importance to any u s policymaker before the summit the first is that data on north korea is available but it requires time and expertise to be evaluated systematized and then used to inform economic prescriptions to sustain peace this rather than easy promises of a bright future should be a guiding principle for u s negotiators the second and most troubling fact is that no matter what metrics we use after forty years and a couple of billion dollars of international aid north korea has very little to show for in terms of growth if one looks only at the gdp the country has gone back to square one right where it was in 1980 with these numbers where does north korea go after a peace declaration overall we can say that aid to north korea has brought some improvement since the years of the famine staving off a bigger catastrophe but the situation remains precarious countrywide and the lasting effect of undernutrition could tip the scales further the aid flow which contributed to prevent the collapse of what north korea in the 1990s was relatively small and it pales in comparison with the funds and efforts that would be needed to support significant meaningful economic growth a growth that a pacified and disarmed north korea would desperately need to justify its own existence this is only half of the equation the north korean government would need to support sustainable and radical reform to come out of the woods it s worth remembering that even optimistic estimates of the costs for a possible reunification to bring the dprk back on its feet without bankrupting its neighbors float in the region of trillions of dollars noteworthy north korea is still not a member of any international financial network or institution before a substantial peace or perhaps even eventually reunification can be a realistic option on the table north korea south korea the u s and the international community need to address the economic elephant in the room in view of the imminent summit it would be reassuring to see the white house aggregating expertise on these issues because despite renewed promises from kim jong un to modernize the country the current economic condition of north korea makes a catch up with seoul impossible let alone reintegration within the ranks of the most dynamic economic region on earth and a peace declaration will not solve that this summit like the meetings that have preceded it appears to be one by the leaders for the leaders the issues explored in this article are vital to the future of the north korean people they ought to be on the table but it s unlikely they will be because neither trump nor kim seem to have solutions gianluca spezza phd is a research fellow at the dprk strategic research center and assistant professor of international relations at kimep university in almaty kazakhstan follow him thespezz nazanin zadeh cummings phd is a lecturer in humanitarian studies at the

by tang yao china daily updated 2019 02 25 08 16 economists believe the developed world s growth prospects will worsen this year in fact on feb 7 the european commission further cut this year s growth forecast for the european union from 2 percent to 1 5 percent and lowered the growth expectation for germany from 1 8 percent to 1 1 percent as for the united kingdom uncertainty over brexit has had a huge impact on its economic prospects the bank of england has cut its forecast for the uk s growth in 2019 from 1 7 percent to 1 2 percent and on feb 8 the reserve bank of australia cut its expectation for australia s growth rate till june 2019 from 3 25 percent to 2 5 percent the december spending for the united states published on feb 14 too saw a 1 2 percent month on month drop far lower than the 0 2 percent increase previously expected later the atlanta branch of the us federal reserve cut its estimate for the us fourth quarter growth for 2018 from 2 7 percent to 1 5 percent us tax cuts drain its fiscal strength these data and the countries macroeconomic conditions suggest the economic outlook of the developed world in the next few years will be one of low growth and low inflation as for the us fiscal policy its financial institutions say that although president donald trump s tax cuts added 25 billion to the economy last year and will add another 40 billion this year the effect will wear off in 2020 with the increase falling to 15 billion which means employment generation and economic growth driven by tax cuts will gradually subside in the us as far as monetary policy is concerned the expected interest rate hikes by the fed in 2019 has slowed down due to the turmoil in the financial market and increasing uncertainty over the economic trend also the us balance sheet reduction which many expect would tighten liquidity is also likely to stop this year paul r krugman and other us economists and some chief financial officers of us companies all expect the us to encounter a mild recession within two years the problem is that the us administration lacks the necessary means to respond to such a development as the fed is said to have space for cutting interest rates by only about 250 basis points given that trump s tax cuts have already overdrawn on the us fiscal strength and since 2020 is a us presidential election year the democrats who control the house of representatives are not likely to approve of the trump administration s fiscal expansion the room to adjust monetary and fiscal policies in other developed countries is too small to effectively respond to a new round of global slowdown the world s major developed countries except the us are yet to normalize their monetary policies and thus have little or no room for interest rate cuts in case of economic recession the high government deficits and national debts they accrued following the 2008 global financial crisis which are difficult to clear within a short time also mean limited room for fiscal expansion also the high national debts are squeezing the space for private investment and corporate financing which in turn is affecting their growth prospects china should optimize supply stabilize demand based on these factors the chinese economy is likely to face a global macro environment of high debt low inflation and low growth in the coming years to maintain steady economic growth and employment therefore china should focus on optimizing supply and stabilizing domestic demand while constantly boosting economic vitality by deepening reform besides as global central banks shift to a more relaxed monetary policy the pressure on the yuan s exchange rate will continue to alleviate meaning china has increasing room for monetary easing as for domestic economic conditions the slower increase of the producer price index and consumer price index last month mean china is facing slackening demand but a certain level of resilience is emerging in its import and export data noncyclical consumption too indicates there is no need for excessive pessimism at present china s policies mainly focus on several aspects including expanding financial support for the real economy as reflected in the huge increase in social financing in january after several reserve requirement ratio cuts last year the positive stable monetary and relaxed credit policy momentum has been maintained at the beginning of this year and proactive fiscal support policies especially for infrastructure projects have also been continuously implemented moreover tax cuts including individual income tax reform which were fully implemented in january and several rounds of corporate tax and fee reductions have been intensified or are in the pipeline it is evident therefore that the chinese economy is far from undergoing a precipitous fall and the employment level is stable policymakers are thus expected to weigh the effects of the combining policies already introduced and interest cuts are not needed to stabilize its economic fundamentals and while having rational expectations for a loose monetary policy the market should focus more on the transmission efficiency of the adopted monetary policies the author is an associate professor at guanghua school of management peking university the views don t necessarily represent those of china daily

monrovia late january when president george manneh weah delivered his annual message before the joint session of the national legislature it was clear that his administration was aware about the anxiety hovering over the nation still in shock over the missing ld16 billion and us 25 million respectively report by rodney d sieh rodney the president acknowledged that during the year 2018 under review the news media was saturated with stories alleging that containers of liberian dollars imported by the central bank were missing given the gravity of the allegations the president declared his administration took several actions in response including setting up a special presidential technical committee to investigate in addition the president said the government requested the assistance of the european union the african union the united states government and the economic community of west african states ecowas to help in conducting a separate external investigation into the alleged missing money with the assistance and support of usaid an audit team from kroll of london england was invited to independently investigate and report findings the report from the kroll audit team is expected at the end of february 2019 and will be released to the public by usaid if it is established that there has been any willful act of criminality negligence or malfeasance by anyone implicated in the reports the full weight of the law will be brought to bear the month of february is now down to its last three days and the expectations are high about the findings in those reports which have until now been mired in secrecy and void of leaks although murmurs about bits and pieces have been floating in the air us information phase long completed frontpageafrica has learned that versions of both the report by the special presidential technical committee and the usaid funded one from the kroll audit firm have been making the internal rounds of the diplomatic and government circles since last november or at least details from them but concerns over how liberians would react to the reports have kept them from the glare of the public eye u s ambassador to liberia christine elder revealed in december 2018 that a usaid hired international forensic team had completed the information gathering phase which involved meeting with number of relevant persons in monrovia including those who are involved with domestic investigation the envoy explained that the liberian government provided full cooperation during the exercise adding that the international forensic team has returned to where it came from and was in the process of analyzing and compiling its findings to be made public although the ambassador failed to mention how soon the report would be out some diplomatic circles suggested that the report would be made public after the christmas and new year s holidays of 2018 even when frontpageafrica sought clarity from the embassy in the new year on its pledge to release the report after the holidays the embassy was mum telling fpa through a spokesperson that it could not provide any further update either than what was provided by the ambassador last december the interest from the us and other international stakeholders was triggered by a massive protest organized by aggrieved and disenchanted citizens under the banners concern citizens united to bring back our money cocubbom and economic freedom fighters of liberia effl for international partners to help with investigators to ascertain the fate of their missing l 16 billion protesters last september made appeals to the us embassy the european union the economic community of west african states ecowas and the united nations to intervene by embarking on the liberian government to account for the missing money the protesters also called on international stakeholders to provide technicians to investigate the matter as they do not trust the liberian government on accounts that officials have been providing conflicting information surrounding the issue and that most of the people on the presidential investigative team are related to people who are to be investigated the us embassy in a release issued on october 10 stated that it was its assessment that such a report would be the most credible and effective means to determine quickly the scale of the problem and would be an appropriate means for the united states to support the liberian government s and citizens desire to understand the allegations and facts if a broader and longer investigation were found to be needed after the scoping mission has concluded the government could discuss next steps with international partners the release said missing money s economic implications it s been a long and dreary past few months of uncertainty the fear of the unknown and the mystery surrounding the missing money cast a dominant shadow over the first year of the weah led government now swirling in the midst of a serious economic and political crisis complicating matters are numerous reports of fiscal indiscipline that have overwhelmed the economy causing a strain on the central bank of liberia cbl that is now in serious financial turmoil the lack of enough local currency on the market has been dampened by a previous year in which the government spent 25 over a hundred million dollars than what was collected in revenue more than its revenue generated economists say due to the current fiscal indiscipline the country s foreign currency reserves to the tone of us 150m one hundred and fifty million that was left by the previous unity party led government have been knowingly or unknowingly depleted as a result foreign currency reserves have dropped from us 150 million one hundred and fifty million to us 25 million twenty five million frontpageafrica has learned that the strains have put the government in the red with debts to the central banks of liberia in the tone of us 125 million one hundred and twenty five million and many economists expressing fears that the government may not be able to repay the loan owed the cbl additionally the government reportedly owes the cbl close to ld 3 billion three billion liberian dollars to be exact ld 2 8billions two billion eight hundred million liberian dollars according to a highly placed cbl source knowing this the source says the ministry of finance continues to write bounced checks which is making it difficult for the cbl to make good from its currency reserves for the past year the cbl has been bailing the government out of its payroll difficulties by financing the payroll but due to low liquidity problems the cbl could only manage to pay some government ministries and agencies for christmas while other ministries and agencies were not paid for the christmas and new year holidays the continued intervention by the cbl to finance the payroll to minimize chaos and stress protests has not only depleted the country s reserves but stands out as the root cause of the unfolding economic crisis cbl source central government savings depleting to make matters worse the liberian revenue authority lra is said to be under performing to meet up with government s monthly payrolls operations and demands the lra is tasked to collect us 1 5m one million five hundred thousand daily but unfortunately the daily revenues collections has dropped as low as us 500 000 five hundred thousand causing a deficit of 66 66 on the performance of the government in the first quarter of the year the government has been surviving mainly on revenues generated from real estate but that has not been forthcoming some diplomatic observers say the cause of the dropped in revenue has to be seriously investigated and immediate steps taken to remedy the situation a senior cbl official with knowledge of the situation speaking strictly on condition of anonymity explained to fpa that as of the date of reporting the central government s savings at the central bank both consolidate and operational accounts are below us 10m ten million this situation presupposes that the central government would be incapacitated to meet up with the monthly civil servants salaries all this as the explanation surrounding the us 25 million intended as a stimulus package to aid the rising us exchange rate remains shrouded in mystery and uncertainty muffled explanation over us 25m finance and economic development planning minister samuel tweah responding to questions during a senate budget hearing last year suggested that while the intervention of the president through the infusion of us 25 million stimulus package has helped to thwart what was gradually becoming a looming financial crisis following the alarming depreciation of the local currency that the transaction unlike others during the past government was done exclusively outside the banking sector and distributed to money changers on the streets the minister assured that the cbl which was responsible for the process has documents with the names telephone numbers and emails of all those who benefited although those names have not been made public the minister explained that of the us 25 million us 17 1 million was used to mop up ld 2 3 billion from the market while claiming that the us 25 million was not intended to remain sustainable but a quick action intervention which has helped to keep the exchange rate stable for some time and that currently there is l 17 1 billion in circulation outside the banking sector in his inaugural address in january president weah explained that as of december 2018 a total of 17 million united states dollars was used for the intervention which significantly contributed to the general stability in the exchange rate for the past six months july to december 2018 the balance 8 million united states dollars is reserved by the cbl as a precautionary intervention fund printing authorization under scrutiny frontpageafrica has learned from investigative sources that while much attention is being placed on the probe of the missing billions and the subsequent us 25 million a key part of the findings is expected to address the issue of who authorized the printing of the billions in local currency and how much was actually printed that issue has landed journalist philipbert s browne in hot water with the national legislature mr brown departed monrovia last week the newspaper had accused some current and former lawmakers from the 53rd national legislature house of representatives of taking bribe to the tone of us 1 2 million one million two hundred thousand united states dollars to give the central bank of liberia cbl the authority to print the l 10 billion ten billion liberian dollars are desperately trying to have him murdered mr browne who says he has left the country for an unknown destination says he has been struggling to validate bond in the wake of an arrest warrant out for him from the legislature mr browne says while he has the financial ability to take care of his bond and legal defense team he has realized that the lawmakers are not interested in going to court but to have him murdered he said that since insurance companies cannot ensure that he obtains a bond his only option as was advised was to flee liberia into exile source sirleaf weeks likely fall guys in the wake of the browne flight fpa has learned from investigative sources that two central current and former cbl figures ex governor j milton weeks and the current deputy governor mr charles sirleaf who happens to be the eldest son of former president ellen johnson sirleaf could face arrest over the printing of the money both men are said to be aware of the looming action and are said to be preparing bonds in the event of an arrest order when the report is finally released the issue is being further compounded by the fact that investigators have reportedly uncover while reconciling the two reports that a little more than ld 2 5 billion two billion five hundred million liberian dollars was printed in excess it is unclear how deep from what fpa has gathered how far both reports would go to address the issue of who ordered the printing of the excess money crane the swedish based company contracted to print the money previously responding to a frontpageafrica inquiry said it does not comment on clients work since reports of the missing money began to surface liberians have been kept in the dark what remains unclear is what happened to the missing containers on the night of march 31st 2018 who signed for the containers leaving the port and where did it go after who escorted the trucks carrying the money and why has it been difficult to find traces of the money anywhere on the market more importantly did the money reached the central bank of liberia or were all taken to the old housing and savings bank down water side as some have speculated in four days bearing anymore prolonging of the release date liberians could finally get the answer to the lingering questions they have been yearning and which have been dogging them all year for those who braved the rain trumpeting bring back our money hashtags and hoovering under lofty expectations the revelation could once and for all allay their fears or redirect them on another adventurous journey in search of the truth

countries opec has around 81 9 percent of proven crude oil reserves within the opec venezuela 24 9 percent saudi arabia 21 9 percent iraq and iran 24 9 percent have the highest reserves according to the us energy information agency s report the us likely has surpassed russia and saudi arabia to become the world s largest crude oil producer shale oil production in the us has increased in recent years resulting in a decline in oil prices however shale oil production is expensive compared to traditional oil production hence in mid 2018 the us crude oil production came down due to lower oil prices with prices rising higher in 2016 they have increased their investment and production any production cut by the opec would drive the prices higher but the individual countries do not want to surrender their market share geopolitical tensions among opec countries have led to a decline in oil prices it is becoming more difficult to curtail the supply which is important for the prices to stay higher apart from the supply and demand oil prices are also dependent on speculative traders oil futures are one of the actively traded commodities similar to the f o market the sudden decline in crude oil prices from 145 in july 2008 to 36 in december can be marginally attributed to the f o market what is brent crude and wti brent crude is extracted from the north sea whereas western texas

introduction when ohioans come together we can accomplish great things together we created a world class system of public universities and built some of the best state parks in the nation it s time to return to what made us great and use our shared resources to reinvest in ohio s greatest asset our people years of budget cuts have left our schools mediocre instead of good our workforce less educated than the national average our people among the country s least healthy and our lakes and rivers polluted we have to start investing again in ohio and ohioans for the past 14 years lawmakers prioritized income tax cuts that benefitted the wealthiest tax breaks for special interests and slashing of business taxes today ohio is one of just six states with no corporate profits tax the state foregoes 9 billion a year in tax breaks which grew by 18 5 percent since 2012 the wealthiest 1 percent of ohioans earning on average 1 3 million a year pay about 41 000 less annually in state taxes than they did under the tax laws of 2005 while on average middle and low income people are paying the same or more than they once did these policy choices reduced funding needed for public schools higher education clean water and other essential services tax cutting didn t fix the economy and lack of investment in public programs has hurt as ohio recovers from the last recession prosperity has not been widely shared there are 115 000 more ohioans living in poverty in 2017 than in 2006 before the recession people who live in poverty are more likely to be unhealthy according to the health policy institute of ohio ohio ranks 44th among states for the health and well being of resident and 47th for how the health of our lower income residents compares to higher income residents other rankings don t look so good either public policy could turn things around ohio lawmakers start the 133d general assembly by putting together a two year state budget this issue brief describes investments that could make ohio healthier better educated better protected and more prosperous lawmakers can pay for these needed investments by ensuring the affluent pay a fair share of state taxes modernizing the tax code to better reflect the new economy including new types of businesses from airbnb to the fracking industry and eliminating or tightening up wasteful tax breaks investing in communities ohio s state and local governments have a history of shared funding and delivery of many public services but in 2018 local governments had lost 1 4 billion adjusted for inflation compared to 2006 in large part due to lawmakers slashing revenue sharing eliminating local taxes and phasing out tax reimbursements some services paid for at the local level were elevated to the state but not enough to offset the loss governor dewine and the 133d general assembly should start to repair the loss in the budget for 2020 and 2021 some places to start are outlined below in other states the state government funds and delivers many services that are funded and delivered locally in ohio local funding relies heavily on property tax levies causing an unequal distribution of essentials like emergency response equipment protective services for seniors and children and defense attorneys in the mid 1930s ohio established the local government fund lgf to distribute a share of state tax collections to counties cities and townships since 2012 state lawmakers have cut the lgf from 3 68 percent of state tax collections to 1 66 percent a cut that amounts to 370 million in 2018 compared to 2011 adjusted for inflation this accounts for a quarter of the 1 46 billion annual loss ohio s local governments have suffered due to state lawmaker actions between 2011 and 2018 adjusted for inflation lawmakers need to rebuild this funding partnership including restoring the municipal component of the lgf distribution which was entirely eliminated in the current 2018 19 budget ohio is 37 million rides short of market demand but could start to close that gap by investing least 150 million a year in public transit transit agencies with a sales tax lost 38 million a year when state lawmakers narrowed the sales tax base in the 2018 19 budget almost completely offsetting the entire state budget allocation of 6 8 million in grf funding and 33 million in federal flex funds the allocation recommended here would build on current funding levels for public transit 39 8 million replace the mco tax loss 38 6 million and boost overall public transit funding by 71 6 million in addition lawmakers should fund a competitive grant of 30 million in federal flex funds to encourage communities to expand sidewalks bike lanes and other alternative transit options the state and counties share the cost of providing legal counsel for people accused of a crime who cannot afford a lawyer as revenue sharing has been cut and local tax sources reduced or eliminated counties struggle with the unpredictable cost of indigent legal defense according to the office of the public defender local government fiscal woes interfere with justice in some counties the state should fully fund the service at the level recommended by the supreme court 189 8 million in 2020 and 195 5 million in 2021 and cover the share now paid by counties a 90 million annual cost in 2020 and 2021 estimates of elderly ohioans who are abused neglected or exploited each year range from 105 000 to 250 000 annual state funding of 2 6 million afforded protection to 19 492 in state fiscal year 2018 but more is needed for sufficient staffing to ensure seniors are safe in the community this is one of many public services with funding shared between state and local government but state cuts hurt counties ability to fund shared services adequately state funds of 22 million a year would support enough staff to investigate cases of elder abuse and financial exploitation and ensure ohio s seniors are safe in their homes and communities the child protective system funded mostly by county property tax levies is also underfunded ohio provides less state aid to child protective services than any other state on any given day more than 15 000 ohio children are in foster care a 21 percent increase from just five years ago the state needs to provide substantially more funding for children s services to meet children s basic needs today and reform the system for tomorrow investing in the labor force work supports ohio s economy has changed many ohio jobs today have very low median wages of the 10 most common ohio occupations three pay less than the federal poverty line for a family of three nine pay less than twice that level and remain within the range at which people can and do access assistance from food banks the answer is a living wage for workers with benefits set schedules and paid sick leave and family leave until these policies are enacted work supports are an essential public service that workers and their employers rely on important investments in work supports for the 2020 21 budget include the earned income tax credit for working families with children is the state s most powerful anti poverty tool like many states ohio has one to offset the regressively of the state and local tax system and help families meet basic needs but ohio s eitc is so weak that it doesn t help 95 percent of the poorest families at all an investment of 175 5 million could make ohio s eitc refundable which would boost its reach to more families increasing the credit to 20 percent of the federal credit and eliminating ohio s unusual cap on families making over 20 000 would allow the credit to be much more effective and make it a more meaningful refund that better keeps up with the cost of living these improvements at a cost of 427 million would make ohio s state and local tax structure fairer as well one in seven ohioans struggle with hunger but working age adults without custody of children can t get help through the federal supplemental nutrition assistance program snap unless their work schedules give them 80 hours a month low wage jobs don t reliably do that snap employment and training services offer a solution by expanding training capacity the snap 50 50 program reimburses 50 percent of nonfederal dollars spent on eligible education and training services for snap recipients voluntary job training that allows adults to prepare for better jobs and get the food they need is the right way to help ohioans gain workforce skills onerous work requirements keep people in poverty wage jobs without offering better opportunities an investment of 4 million per year in general revenue funds will draw down a 2 million federal reimbursement to train the neediest ohioans for better jobs and keep them from going hungry in ohio 208 000 children under 6 years old are from families making no more than 200 percent of the federal poverty line 42 660 for a family of three this is the level at which individuals and families are eligible for and need food assistance from food banks for these families the cost of child care can take nearly half of family income yet only families making less than 27 024 127 percent of the 2019 federal poverty level can get into the state program for child care aid only one state makes it harder to qualify initially an additional investment of 150 million would allow the state to raise the eligibility level with a goal of restoring income eligibility to 200 percent of the federal poverty level as it was in 2009 as hate crimes rise and more sexual harassment victims come forward long term erosion of state funding for the ohio civil rights commission threatens our ability to protect ohioans from discrimination and harassment boosting the agency s budget by 2 5 million to 7 3 million a year will reset funding to the inflation adjusted level of 2001 and allow the agency to restore outreach and education and hire investigators in regional offices restoring the budget of the bureau of wage and hour administration must be a state priority funding for the bureau is down 24 percent on an inflation adjusted basis since 2010 today just five investigators and one supervisor oversee wage theft enforcement in a state with nearly six million workers just one investigator for every 961 167 workers the same group is responsible for enforcing prevailing wage requirements to protect ohio s construction workers because the section is under resourced enforcement is complaint driven rather than strategic and proactive the cleveland plain dealer found that the bureau collected only a fraction of what wage victims were owed at a time when abuse should be getting increasing attention doubling funding to just 2 2 million a year in the upcoming budget would allow the agency to start restoring staffing we should also invest to revamp data systems so the bureau can fully respond to public information requests about wage and hour violations and can launch strategic enforcement campaigns to protect workers and law abiding employers investing in health according to the health policy institute of ohio ohio ranks 44thamong states for the health and well being of residents and 47thfor how the health of lower income residents compares to higher income residents in the low wage economy medicaid is an essential tool for individuals and families covering about 3 million ohioans more than a quarter of the population and half of all births in the state it is the most important tool we have in fighting ohio s addiction crisis protecting medicaid is critical to improving the health of ohioans but good health also depends on many external factors the social determinants of health include living conditions like affordable lead free housing in safe neighborhoods opportunity like quality education from pre k to college environment like clean and safe water and access to services governor dewine and the 133rd general assembly should fully fund health care and public health programing and invest to improve conditions that can lead to poor health nearly 700 000 ohioans are insured by the medicaid expansion which in 2021 will bring 4 6 billion federal dollars into the state with an expected state match of 163 million in the 2020 2021 budget period the federal government will pay just over 90 percent of the cost of health care for these ohioans as those federal dollars circulate in the economy they create 54 000 ohio jobs state legislators have tried to eliminate ohio s medicaid expansion erode it through enrollment freezes or throw up barriers like charging premiums and requiring more hours of work than many low wage job schedules reliably provide access to health care without freezes barriers and harsh requirements is essential to low wage workers job seekers disabled people caretakers students and their families better addressing the drug crisis requires retaining medicaid expansion enforcing mental health parity laws strengthening existing local treatment systems and training more mental health workers ohio had the second largest number of overdose deaths in the nation in 2017 although recent data shows some improvement currently only four of 10 people with a mental illness and one of 10 people with addiction get access to the treatment and services they need the biggest barrier is lack of timely quality and affordable services especially in rural areas medicaid expansion is credited as the most important tool to stem the crisis legislative proposals to eliminate it outright or slash it by freezing enrollment imposing harsh new eligibility requirements based on hours of work or increasing cost to patients would halt progress in fighting the drug epidemic legislators must protect medicaid expansion and safeguard ohio s mostly privatized medicaid system from faulty administration ensuring timely payment to independent behavioral health providers the backbone of treatment and recovery in many ohio communities we can expand capacity by enforcing mental health parity laws that say public and private insurers must fund mental health on par with other health challenges ohio lawmakers should build on the local mental health and addiction systems built with federal 21stcentury cures act funds quick response teams prevention in schools and ongoing training for medical professional using medication assisted treatments in the tight budget for 2018 19 lawmakers earmarked and redirected existing mental health local government and temporary assistance for needy families tanf funds to treatment and other community needs related to the drug crisis this year they must replace those funds with sustainable resources for a long term muscular effort ohio needs more psychiatric and detox beds funding for beds and facilities must be increased there are not nearly enough trained mental health workers to deliver needed services a workforce development plan is needed funds are also needed to collect and share data lawmakers should scrutinize all state agencies for opportunities to support the recovery continuum of care for example employment services are an essential part of the community mental health and addiction service continuum in 2018 ohio passed on 31 million federal vocational rehabilitation dollars that could have been drawn down to help disabled ohioans recover and work this was the largest sum any state chose to forego 8 4 million in state funds could have drawn these funds into ohio to support employment services for people recovering from mental health and addiction illnesses ohio s overall infant mortality rate of 7 2 deaths per 1 000 live births is higher than 42 other states this figure masks shocking racial disparity the infant mortality rate for african american babies is 15 6 percent and has gone up over the past three years the help me grow home visiting program helps reduce infant mortality but ohio s program serves less than 5 percent of eligible families governor dewine has pledged to triple the number a good start but one that would still reach just 12 percent of those eligible dewine has noted that this target is too low the state should set a goal of reaching all eligible women and infants if not in this budget then in the next in 2016 54 6 percent of ohio s children had health insurance through medicaid and its program for children called the state children s health insurance program schip the affordable care act boosted the federal government s share of the cost through schip but when congress reauthorized the program for 2020 it reduced the federal share the consequent increase in the state s share will be 60 million in 2020 and 140 million in 2021 lawmakers must authorize increased funding for schip at existing eligibility and service levels they must not use it as an excuse to eliminate the medicaid expansion which serves adults pitting kids against parents over who gets health care is a savage fight ohio doesn t need the ohio department of health estimates 12 percent of cleveland kids that have been tested have lead poisoning at or above the level that triggers public health action children across the state face the same dangers cambridge zanesville and census tracts in perry county share the same dangerous risk of lead poisoning as cleveland canton and dayton child lead poisoning can cause irreversible brain and nervous system damage leading to learning and behavioral challenges as a starting point the state should allocate 12 6 million which draws an additional 24 2 million in federal schip medicaid funds for local prevention efforts to support lead investigations and to provide case management treatment and remediation to afflicted children investing in education ohio fell from 5th to 21st among states in the quality of primary and secondary education between 2010 and 2017 according to education week the state is moving in the wrong direction the goal of the ohio department of higher education is to boost the share of working age ohioans with a degree or certificate by 65 percent by 2025 but affordability is the main barrier to degree completion and the cost of attending ohio s public colleges and universities is higher than 44 other states investments like those listed below here could help ohio change direction on education and opportunity ohio lags the nation in low income students access to public preschool currently ohio s early education grant program only serves about 18 000 just 5 percent of 4 year olds nationally 29 percent are in state public pre school and 2 percent of 3 year olds nationally 5 percent of 3 year olds are enrolled research indicates that ohioans who go to preschool can look forward to a better chance of success in school graduation and a brighter future an investment of 440 million would allow almost 100 000 more eligible low income children to attend public preschool preparing them to read and succeed in school school funding needs should be based on the cost of educating students including wraparound services such as mental health counselors social workers and school nurses ohio currently does not do it this way although lawmakers are preparing recommendations for a new funding formula aimed at a more rational distribution however it is accomplished they should allocate additional funds for schools with economic challenges there were 826 000 economically disadvantaged students in ohio s public schools in 2018 these students may face hunger homelessness and trauma schools must offer social and emotional support specialized academics for the students and training for teachers and staff the number of very low income students grew by 67 percent since 1999 but targeted funding for schools that serve them grew by only 23 percent funding should be increased in the 2020 21 budget from the current arbitrary figure of 272 per disadvantaged student to 425 as a bridge measure allowing the ohio department of education to a figure out a better measure of economically disadvantaged students b conduct a cost study and c examine whether the current poverty aid formula is the best one or not the cost of the bridge funding would be about 256 million a year affordability is a big barrier to college attainment and ohio s public colleges and universities are too expensive with too little need based financial aid ohio is ranked 45th least affordable for college for families of low and modest income and ohioans owe 57 billion in student debt one of the highest rates of debt per capita in the nation lawmakers goal of raising college attainment from 40 percent of working age ohioans to 65 percent by 2025 will take significant investment a grf appropriation of 106 million would boost the ohio college opportunity grant ocog the state s only need based grant to 207 million a year this would not reach the goal of 250 million set by a task force under governor taft this investment would restore ocog for about 114 500 low income community college and regional campus students who are currently excluded and boost the maximum award for central state university a more aspirational effort would guarantee that students of middle and low income families can afford college if lawmakers want to significantly raise the share of ohioans with a degree or certificate they must boost investment in higher education but the investment trend is headed in the wrong direction according to the center on budget and policy priorities the state s per pupil spending was 18 1 percent lower in 2018 than in 2008 adjusted for inflation a bigger decline in higher education investment than 23 other states the high cost of ohio s public colleges and universities won t come down unless the state restores its share of the cost of classroom instruction former chancellor of the department of higher education john carey emphasized the need for state investment in state share of instruction chancellor randy gardner needs to keep the pressure on investing in basic needs according to the health policy institute ohio ranks 47thamong the states for how health of lower income residents compares to higher income residents services that provide for basic needs have a big impact on health in addition to the priorities outlined here legislators should conduce a health equity impact analysis of all legislation in the same way that they conduct a business impact analysis the largest share of ohio s health and human service programming comes from the federal government and ohio could lose federal funding and congressional representation if state residents are undercounted in the 2020 census undercounting of people is common in hard to reach places like rural counties and densely populated central cities or among people who may be afraid to be counted like legal immigrants state funding of 2 5 million for education outreach and accuracy efforts and 250 000 to staff a complete count commission would ensure a fair comprehensive and accurate count one in seven ohioans struggles with hunger one in five children may go to bed hungry unpredictable disasters like the federal shutdown storms and major plant closings highlight the growing need for stronger state level funding to prevent hunger an annual 30 million allocation will fund a range of proven anti hunger initiatives like summer lunches for kids the ohio agricultural clearance program and collaboration among local organizations that find resources for families and people in need just 42 rental units are affordable and available for every 100 extremely low income tenant households in ohio there is great need but less funding for affordable housing because the ohio housing trust fund has fallen by 20 million from a target of 50 million a year the general assembly should rebuild the trust fund with a 20 million annual allocation from the general revenue fund which would almost double the number of affordable housing projects built and low income families helped homelessness is on the rise in ohio jumping by 53 percent between 2012 and 2017 when 70 123 ohioans accessed homeless services a third were children 23 000 including nearly 3 000 infants an allocation of 25 million over a two year period from ohio s tanf surplus could create the homeless families assistance program for immediate flexible funding for rapid re housing and homelessness prevention services to divert several thousand families with children from shelter to housing across ohio thousands of children are caught up in state and local correctional health mental health child welfare and other systems the joint legislative committee on multi system youth of the 130th general assembly studied the needs and the gaps in systems that result in custody relinquishment chaired by senator gardner and representative latourette the bi partisan committee unanimously recommended dedicated funding for services including funds to help youth and families in crisis access appropriate care collecting and sharing data creating various medicaid reimbursable wraparound and peer services and others an allocation of 15 million over two years would support these recommendations paying for investments lawmakers can pay for these needed investments by ensuring the affluent pay a fair share of state taxes modernizing the tax code to better reflect the new economy including new types of businesses from airbnb to fracking ensuring existing sales taxes are collected including from on line retailers and eliminating or tightening up inefficient ineffective tax breaks lawmakers spend through the tax code as well as through the budget state coffers forgo 9 4 billion a year to 129 tax breaks budget talks focus on expenditures taxpayer dollars forgone need to be scrutinized as well the tax expenditure review committee has this job but has been unstaffed and review is weak this should be changed in the budget for 2020 21 lawmakers should fully fund staffing for the tax expenditure review committee s evaluation and oversight of tax expenditures at a level comparable to that of the joint medicaid oversight committee 840 000 a year and the joint education oversight committee 350 000 the legislative service commission should hire experienced staff to assist and should contract with outside experts to allow lawmakers to be as scrupulous in overseeing the 9 billion spent through the tax code as they are in the 8 billion they spend on medicaid health services or the 9 8 billion on schools summary ohio s long run of tight budgets has meant underinvestment and a weakened state this has meant worse health more hunger and lower quality schools it s meant too little transit and too much lead poisoning it s meant high cost college and low quality housing our infant mortality rates are too high our overdose rates are alarming and our racial disparities for many outcomes are shameful state investment has been flat since the recession adjusted for inflation although needs have grown many places have not recovered from the recession poverty remains high with an estimated 14 9 percent of ohioans living in poverty in 2017 higher than the 13 percent in 2006 before the recession increased tax revenues that came with economic recovery were not used to improve ohio communities and schools they were mostly used for income tax cuts tax breaks for special interests and replenishment of the state rainy day fund

again economic indicators update
by it s not uncommon to read new stories that quite explicitly identify economic mismanagement for example news reports on the hyperinflation in zimbabwe routinely and correctly attribute the cause to the poor economic management by its leaders we will see similar attributions of mismanagement to a wide range of developing countries one place we will never see the term mismanagement or any equivalent term applied is in reference to the austerity imposed on the euro zone countries by the european commission acting largely at the direction of the german government in fact major news outlets like the new york times seem to go out of their way to deny the incredible harm done to euro zone economies and to the lives of tens of millions of people in these countries as a result of needless austerity a decade ago it would at least have been an arguable point as to whether austerity meaning budget cuts in the wake of the great recession was reasonable policy there was some research suggesting that the boost to confidence from lower budget deficits could spur enough investment and consumption to offset the impact on demand of reductions in government spending however since then we have far more evidence on the impact of deficit reduction in the context of an economy coming out of recession there have been numerous studies most importantly several from the international monetary fund s research department which show that lower deficits in this context slow growth and raise unemployment furthermore they show that periods of high unemployment have a lasting impact as a result of workers losing skills and companies and governments foregoing investment in a downturn that they would have undertaken if the economy were closer to its potential level of output this means that insistence on deficit reduction not only led to one time drops in output and employment but could reduce potential output by trillions of dollars over subsequent years at this point the advocates of fiscal austerity in the context of economies that are operating well below potential gdp are ignoring a large body of evidence in favor of personal prejudices these people should be viewed like global warming deniers or creationists they are not credible people and their policies have inflicted enormous damage where they have been put in place incredibly instead of pointing out that the advocates of austerity have been shown wrong most reporting continues to treat their policies as being credible and in fact often works to hide evidence of its failure the new york times gave us a great example of this practice in an articleon the decline of the middle class across europe with a focus on spain spain has been especially hard hit by the demands for austerity in contrast to greece and italy spain had actually been running budget surpluses in the years leading up to the crisis its debt to gdp ratio was just 22 3 percent when the crisis hit less than half of germany s so there was no story of profligate government spending what spain did have was a massive housing bubble fueled largely by german banks who apparently were not very good at their business when the bubbles burst in spain and elsewhere the economy in spain was especially hard hit with the unemployment rate crossing 26 percent in 2013 while the unemployment rate has come down in the last five years the number of people employed is still more than one million less than before the crisis spain is a country that could have benefited enormously from a large scale stimulus program both domestically and the across the eurozone since much of what its gdp is exported instead the great minds in charge of the euro zone s economic policy insisted that spain had to reduce its budget deficits to comply with the euro s rules given this history the cause of the decline of the middle class in spain seems about as clear as the causes of a person s mobility problems after they have been run over by a truck instead the nyt made it all seem very mysterious telling readers spain s economy like the rest of europe s is growing faster than before the 2008 financial crisis and creating jobs but the work they could find pays a fraction of the combined 80 000 euro annual income they once earned by summer they figure they will no longer be able to pay their mortgage it is a precarious situation felt by millions of europeans since the recession of the late 2000s the middle class has shrunk in over two thirds of the european union echoing a similar decline in the united states and reversing two decades of expansion while middle class households are more prevalent in europe than in the united states around 60 percent compared with just over 50 percent in america they face unprecedented levels of vulnerability the hurdles to keeping their status or recovering lost ground are higher given post recession labor dynamics the loss of middle income jobs weakened social protections and skill mismatches have reduced economic mobility and widened income inequality automation and globalization are deepening the divides just about every part of this story is wrong spain and most other european countries are not growing faster than before the recession according to the i m f spain s economy grew at a 2 7 percent rate in 2018 and is projected to grow 2 2 percent this year by comparison it grew at an average rate of more than 3 9 percent in 2006 and 2007 the last two years before the recession but more importantly the immediately relevant factor is cumulative growth not a single year as a result of its sharp downturn and weak recovery spain s per capita gdp was just 3 0 percent higher in 2018 than it was in 2007 by comparison coming out of the great depression in the united states per capita income in 1940 was more than 8 0 percent higher than in 1929 given these basic growth numbers it would be surprising if spain s middle class had not taken a big hit while other factors like the weakening of labor market protections has made its plight worse the dismal story on growth goes a very long way in explaining the decline in spain and europe s middle class unfortunately this sort of story in the nyt is not an exception the paper has repeatedly told readers that policies that undermined the welfare state and redistributed money upward were being done for the purpose of revitalizing the economy this was especially the case with emanuel macron in france here here and here in these and other cases the media took at face value the claims of politicians that the reason for the measures was to help workers not to reduce their bargaining power which is their immediate effect to be clear labor market regulations can be excessive and there are certainly contexts in which streamlining them would end up benefiting most of the labor force even if such streamlining could hurt narrow groups of workers but the idea that excessive labor market regulation rather than inept macroeconomic policy is the main problem limiting growth and reducing employment in france spain and elsewhere in europe does not have any evidence to support it david howell andrew glyn john schmitt and i did a study showing the limited impact of labor market protections on employment more than a decade ago based on our work the oecd did its own analysis and reached similar conclusions in short the nyt and other media outlets have been engaged in a great exercise in misdirection while the blame for europe s economic problems over the last decade can very clearly be laid at the doorstep of its leaders who have insisted on austerity the media consistently ignore evidence that is as clear as day they instead treat the problems facing europe s workers as

washington president donald trump said on sunday he would delay an increase in us tariffs on chinese goods thanks to productive trade talks and that he and chinese president xi jinping would meet to seal a deal if progress continued the announcement was the clearest sign yet that china and the united states are closing in on a deal to end a months long trade war that has slowed global growth and disrupted markets trump had planned to raise tariffs to 25 per cent from 10 per cent on 200 billion worth of chinese imports into the united states if an agreement between the world s two largest economies were not reached by friday after a week of talks that extended into the weekend trump said those tariffs would not go up for now in a tweet he said progress had been made in divisive areas including intellectual property protection technology transfers agriculture services and currency as a result he said i will be delaying the us increase in tariffs now scheduled for march 1 assuming both sides make additional progress we will be planning a summit for president xi and myself at mar a lago to conclude an agreement a very good weekend for u s china mar a lago is the president s

diplomat state councillor wang yi told a forum in beijing on monday that the talks had made substantive progress providing positive expectations for the stability of bilateral ties and global economic development china s foreign ministry said trump and xi called a 90 day truce last year to give their advisers time to negotiate a deal the threat of tariff increases represented significant leverage for the trump team as beijing is trying to stabilise china s cooling economy we can t be sure whether this constitutes a major cave or success because we don t know the details of what has been negotiated but agreeing to extend negotiations a few more weeks definitely is in china s interests said scott kennedy a china expert at the centre for strategic and international studies in washington at this point the us has likely gotten all it s going to get out of china j p morgan asset management market strategist tai hui said the move suggested both sides wanted a settlement of the dispute

it s not uncommon to read news stories that quite explicitly identify economic mismanagement for example news reports on the hyperinflation in zimbabwe routinely and correctly attribute the cause to the poor economic management by its leaders we will see similar attributions of mismanagement to a wide range of developing countries one place we will never see the term mismanagement or any equivalent term applied is in reference to the austerity imposed on the euro zone countries by the european commission acting largely at the direction of the german government in fact major news outlets like the new york times seem to go out of their way to deny the incredible harm done to euro zone economies and to the lives of tens of millions of people in these countries as a result of needless austerity a decade ago it would at least have been an arguable point as to whether austerity meaning budget cuts in the wake of the great recession was reasonable policy there was some research suggesting that the boost to confidence from lower budget deficits could spur enough investment and consumption to offset the impact on demand of reductions in government spending since then however we have far more evidence on the impact of deficit reduction in the context of an economy coming out of recession there have been numerous studies most importantly several from the international monetary fund s research department which show that lower deficits in this context slow growth and raise unemployment furthermore they show that periods of high unemployment have a lasting impact as a result of workers losing skills and companies and governments in a downturn foregoing investment that they would have undertaken if the economy were closer to its potential level of output this means that insistence on deficit reduction not only led to one time drops in output and employment but could reduce potential output by trillions of dollars over subsequent years at this point the advocates of fiscal austerity in the context of economies that are operating well below potential gdp are ignoring a large body of evidence in favor of personal prejudices these people should be viewed like global warming deniers or creationists they are not credible people and their policies have inflicted enormous damage where they have been put in place incredibly instead of pointing out that the advocates of austerity have been shown wrong most reporting continues to treat their policies as being credible and in fact often works to hide evidence of its failure the new york times 2 14 19 gave us a great example of this practice in an article on the decline of the middle class across europe with a focus on spain spain has been especially hard hit by the demands for austerity in contrast to greece and italy spain had actually been running budget surpluses in the years leading up to the crisis its debt to gdp ratio was just 22 3 percent when the crisis hit less than half of germany s so there was no story of profligate government spending what spain did have was a massive housing bubble fueled largely by german banks who apparently were not very good at their business when the bubbles burst in spain and elsewhere the economy in spain was especially hard hit with the unemployment rate crossing 26 percent in 2013 while the unemployment rate has come down in the last five years the number of people employed is still more than 1 million less than before the crisis spain is a country that could have benefited enormously from a large scale stimulus program both domestically and the across the eurozone since much of its gdp is exported instead the great minds in charge of the euro zone s economic policy insisted that spain had to reduce its budget deficits to comply with the euro s rules given this history the cause of the decline of the middle class in spain seems about as clear as the causes of a person s mobility problems after they have been run over by a truck instead the new york times made it all seem very mysterious telling readers spain s economy like the rest of europe s is growing faster than before the 2008 financial crisis and creating jobs but the work they could find pays a fraction of the combined 80 000 euro annual income they once earned by summer they figure they will no longer be able to pay their mortgage it is a precarious situation felt by millions of europeans since the recession of the late 2000s the middle class has shrunk in over two thirds of the european union echoing a similar decline in the united states and reversing two decades of expansion while middle class households are more prevalent in europe than in the united states around 60 percent compared with just over 50 percent in america they face unprecedented levels of vulnerability the hurdles to keeping their status or recovering lost ground are higher given post recession labor dynamics the loss of middle income jobs weakened social protections and skill mismatches have reduced economic mobility and widened income inequality automation and globalization are deepening the divides just about every part of this story is wrong spain and most other european countries are not growing faster than before the recession according to the imf spain s economy grew at a 2 7 percent rate in 2018 and is projected to grow 2 2 percent this year by comparison it grew at an average rate of more than 3 9 percent in 2006 and 2007 the last two years before the recession but more importantly the immediately relevant factor is cumulative growth not a single year as a result of its sharp downturn and weak recovery spain s per capita gdp was just 3 0 percent higher in 2018 than it was in 2007 by comparison coming out of the great depression in the united states per capita income in 1940 was more than 8 0 percent higher than in 1929 given these basic growth numbers it would be surprising if spain s middle class had not taken a big hit while other factors like the weakening of labor market protections have made its plight worse the dismal story on growth goes a very long way in explaining the decline in spain and europe s middle class unfortunately this sort of story in the new york times is not an exception the paper has repeatedly told readers that policies that undermined the welfare state and redistributed money upward were being done for the purpose of revitalizing the economy this was especially the case with emanuel macron in france here here and here in these and other cases the media took at face value the claims of politicians that the reason for the measures was to help workers not to reduce their bargaining power which is their immediate effect to be clear labor market regulations can be excessive and there are certainly contexts in which streamlining them would end up benefiting most of the labor force even if such streamlining could hurt narrow groups of workers but the idea that excessive labor market regulation rather than inept macroeconomic policy is the main problem limiting growth and reducing employment in france spain and elsewhere in europe does not have any evidence to support it david howell andrew glyn john schmitt and i did a study showing the limited impact of labor market protections on employment more than a decade ago based on our work the oecd did its own analysis and reached similar conclusions in short the new york times and other media outlets have been engaged in a great exercise in misdirection while the blame for europe s economic problems over the last decade can very clearly be laid at the doorstep of its leaders who have insisted on austerity the media consistently ignore evidence that is as clear as day they instead treat the problems facing europe s workers as being mysterious in origin or due primarily to an overly generous welfare state and excessive regulations that protect workers this is some seriously biased and or

postulated i e reverse causality from prior mainstream thinking meaning the boom caused the surpluses however i would also say that the government surpluses were also a sign that the boom was unsustainable because it meant private sector dissaving one piece that gets at the monetary side of this is from tim duy where tim talks about the likelihood of a more aggressive monetary response in the next downturn this is something that pedro da costa and albert edwards have also flagged tim writes finally in case you missed it it is worth your time to review the action at last week s monetary policy forum paper here comments by new york federal reserve president john williams here and comments by richard clarida here a takeaway is that the fed is preparing for the next downturn with the expectation that new tools need to be ready to address another trip to the effective lower bound importantly the fed will be looking for tools to prevent downward drift on inflation expectations by for instance policies such as makeup strategies that allow for higher inflation to make of for periods of low inflation i think a result of this work will likely be a more aggressive monetary policy in the wake of the next downturn unfortunately time constraints mean i will have to get you my thoughts on this in greater detail later today i want to concentrate on europe may s strategy is empty on all levels back in december when british prime minister theresa may decided to postpone a parliamentary vote on the deal she negotiated with the eu i had this to say i think theresa may s days are numbered the only reason she remains in power now is that there are no obvious successors and fear of corbyn is too great to take a risk on changing leader while the brexit process is ongoing this calculus changes considerably if brexit can be delayed or article 50 revoked unilaterally as the european court of justice confirmed is possible today from a purely political perspective this makes delaying brexit past 29 mar 2019 the obvious priority for the majority of mps within the conservative party who are not committed to a no deal brexit and if that delay cannot be achieved due to eu recalcitrance parliament will be forced to consider revoking article 50 altogether simply to stop the clock ticking this logic remains very much intact hard brexit advocates in the erg overplayed their hand in trying to remove may it was incredibly poor timing now she can soldier on for almost a year longer but she s a dead woman walking her management and tactics on the withdrawal agreement negotiation have been shambolic it s only the fear of a corbyn government and the no deal brexit lever that give her any sway in parliament at all when her year is up she s done no deal brexit is coming off the table i think the rebellion against may s brexit tactics are about to hot up if she persists in using a no deal brexit as a lever to get her deal through parliament my view remains that the no deal outcome is not viable politically and since may s deal is equally non viable we will see an article 50 delay opponents of britain crashing out of the eu have three things that make them likely to pull the trigger and force a delay eu support for delay it is now clear that the eu wants a delay in fact donald tusk is on record saying that he prefers a long delay to prevent a short delay from creating a perpetual state of brexit emergency we re talking extension of brexit for two years until 2021 that will galvanize both those who see an extension as giving the british economy room to breathe and those who are hoping for a second referendum the increased likelihood of a no deal outcome exasperation with may s handling of brexit is growing in brussels as senior insiders put the chance of crashing out without a deal at more than 50 that s a quote from the linked article above alarm is growing both in the eu and in the uk about the economic situation particularly given the near recession outlook on the continent a no deal outcome would crystallize worst case recession outcomes time is short according to news reports theresa may has already been warned by her ministers that she has just two days to agree to a brexit delay or face a mass revolt amber rudd greg clark david gauke and david mundell are leading this assault with rudd the figure most prominently featured in reporting the times says rudd could be joined by as many as 20 junior ministers and 100 tory mps who with labour support would be expected to defeat may and with the times of london saying may has told merkel she won t delay brexit the rebels will act so i think this is it no deal is coming off the table very shortly if may insists that she won t delay and is forced to concede defeat in a vote of parliament her leadership will be greatly undermined she can limp on but i suspect she will be forced to resign since parliament will have rejected her deal by overwhelming majority and voted for a different path in defiance of her will nothing is etched in stone but i believe we are getting closer to the delay of article 50 outcome that i have been saying is likely since december where would this leave us look at the basket case that is europe right now it may already be too late to prevent a recession irrespective of what happens with brexit germany is in horrible shape but it is in italy where the rubber hits the road recession means larger deficits likely a serious breach of the maastricht 3 hurdle and then we will be back to a standoff between the italian government and brussels moreover soon mario whatever it takes draghi will be gone replaced by a new ecb head will that ecb head say peter praet for example do what ever it takes for italy if it is flouting the deficit rules of the stability and growth pact during a recession and if he doesn t what happens to italian government bond yields and the capital of italian banks who own those bonds i see this as a potentially existential problem because italy is not greece and because deutsche bank a german bank is likely to get caught up in this mess as its capital weakness will make it vulnerable to eu bail in rules in the next downturn all of this dysfunction could be happening against the backdrop of an article 50 extension that is not going to make the case for staying in the eu and so those hoping that an extension leads to a second referendum may end up disappointed if that referendum turns out exactly as the first did with britain rejecting eu membership my take the wildcard in this is trump he has signalled compromise on tariffs on china but he is also threatening europe with tariffs on their autos if either of these dust ups leads to tariffs especially the one over european cars europe will be in a world of hurt and the italian excessive deficit scenario will crystallize the eu simply doesn t have the institutional architecture in place to tamp down on economic crises in the making in fact the rules for the eurozone the bail in rules and the lack of an eu wide mutualized bank resolution solution means eu recessions will be considerably worse than if the euro didn t exist the ecb is also already at 0 40 on its policy rate and the political opposition to more qe and ecb asset purchases will increase while the uk sits outside of most of this structure it is still inextricably linked to it as a part of the eu i believe that sets us up for an increase in negative eu sentiment come 2020 and 2021 moreover in the coming european parliamentary elections fully a quarter of the european mps elected could be eurosceptic or critical of brussels that s a far cry from 10 or 15 years ago when nigel farage was the only one who could be said to be of that ilk my view europe is where the biggest downside risks are politically and economically in the developed world this is bullish for aa and aaa rated eurozone government bonds but it s bearish for european risk assets moreover in a crisis situation one would expect a flight to the us dollar the swiss franc and the japanese yen exacerbating any distress in emerging markets whether that s latam emea or asia

president trump has been executing a foreign policy a clear doctrine of sorts where national security is achieved by leveraging u s economic power it is a fundamental shift in approaching both allies and adversaries summarized within the oft repeated phrase economic security is national security the trump doctrine of using economics to achieve national security objectives is a fundamental paradigm shift modern u s history provides no easy reference peace is the prize president donald trump the nature of the trump foreign policy doctrine as it has become visible is to hold manipulative influence agents accountable for regional impact s and simultaneously work to stop any corrupted influence from oppressing free expression of national values held by the subservient dis empowered people within the nation being influenced there have been clear examples of this doctrine at work when president trump first visited the middle east he confronted the international audience with a message about dealing with extremist influence agents president trump simply said drive them out toward that end as qatar was identified as a financier of extremist ideology president trump placed the goal of confrontation upon the gulf cooperation council not the u s the u s role was clearly outlined as supporting the confrontation saudi arabia kuwait egypt bahrain and the united arab emirates needed to confront the toxic regional influence the u s would support their objective that s what happened another example to confront the extremism creating the turmoil in afghanistan president trump placed the burden of bringing the taliban to the table of governance upon primary influence agent pakistan here again with u s support pakistan is the leading influence agent over the taliban in afghanistan the trump administration correctly established the responsibility and gives clear expectations for u s support if pakistan doesn t change their influence objective toward a more constructive alignment with a nationally representative afghanistan government it is pakistan who will be held accountable again the correct and effective appropriation of responsibility upon the influence agent who can initiate the solution pakistan the process of accurate regional assignment of influence comes with disconcerting sunlight often these influences are not discussed openly however for president trump the lack of honesty is only a crutch to continue enabling poor actors this is a consistent theme throughout all of president trump s foreign policy engagements the european union is a collective co dependent enabler to the corrupt influences of iran therefore the assignment of responsibility to change the status is placed upon the eu the u s will fully support the eu effort but as seen in the withdrawal from the iran deal the u s will not enable growth of toxic behavior the u s stands with the people of iran but the u s will not support the enabling of iranian oppression terrorism and or dangerous military expansion that will ultimately destabilize the region trump holds the eu accountable for influencing change again we see the trump doctrine at work perhaps the most obvious application of the trump doctrine is found in how the u s administration approached the challenging behavior of north korea rather than continuing a decades long policy of ignoring the influence of china president trump directly assigned primary responsibility for a reset to beijing china held and holds all influence upon north korea and has long treated the dprk as a proxy province to do the bidding of beijing s communist old guard by directly confronting the influence agent and admitting openly for the world to see albeit with jaw dropping tactical sanction diplomacy president trump positioned the u s to support a peace objective on the entire korean peninsula and simultaneously forced china to openly display their closely guarded influence while the red dragon vs panda influence dynamic is still ongoing the benefit of this new and strategic approach has brought the possibility of peace closer than ever in recent history no longer is it outlandish to think of north korea joining with the rest of the world in achieving a better quality of life for its people not only is president trump openly sharing a willingness to engage in a new and dynamic future for north korea but his approach is removing the toxic influences that have held down the possibility for generations by leveraging china through economics to stop manipulating north korea president trump is opening up a door of possibilities for the north korean people this is what i mean when i say trump is providing north korea with an opportunity to create an authentic version of itself what ultimately comes from the opportunity president trump has constructed is entirely unknown however the opportunity itself is stunning progress creating a reasonable pathway to prosperity for the north korean people chairman kim jong un has the opportunity to be the most trans formative leader within asia in generations but it is still only an opportunity whether kim jong un can embrace openness free markets and prosperity is yet to be seen freedom is a precariously scary endeavor because there s always a danger loosening the grip on control can lead to fear which can lead to even tighter more authoritarian control the commonality in these foreign policy engagements is the strategic placement of responsibility upon the primary influence agent and a clear understanding upon those nation s of influence that all forward efforts must ultimately provide positive results for people impacted who lack the ability to create positive influence themselves one of the reasons president trump is able to take this approach is specifically because he is beholden to no outside influence himself it is only from the position of complete independence that accurate assignments based on the underlying truth can be made and that takes us to the ultimate confrontations the trillion dollar confrontations a u s foreign policy that provides the opportunity for fully realized national authenticity is a paradigm shift amid a world that has grown accustomed to corrupt globalists bankers and financial elites who have established a business model by dictating terms to national leaders they control and influence we have our own frame of reference with k street lobbyists in washington dc much of president trump s global trade reset is based on confronting these multinational influence agents when you take the influence of corporate financial brokers out of foreign policy all of a sudden those global influence peddlers are worthless absent of their ability to provide any benefit nations no longer purchase these brokered services as soon as influence brokers are dispatched national politicians become accountable to the voices of their citizens when representing the voices of citizens becomes the primary political driver of national policy the authentic image of the nation is allowed to surface in western or what we would call more democratized systems of government the consequence of removing multinational corporate and financial influence peddlers presents two options for the governing authority occupying political office one option is to refuse to allow the authentic voice of a nationalist citizenry to rise essentially to commit to a retention of the status quo an elitist view a globalist perspective this requires shifting to a more openly authoritarian system of government within both the economic and social spheres those who control the reigns of power refuse to acquiesce to a changed landscape the second option is to allow the authentic and organic rise of nationalism to accept the voices of the middle class majority to structure the economic and social landscape in a manner that allows the underlying identity to surface naturally fortunately we are living in a time of great history and we have multiple examples surfacing around the world national elections in poland hungary italy brazil and right here in the u s via donald trump highlight responses to dysfunctional multiculturalism and financial influences from corrupt elites within the institutions of globalist advocacy the international monetary fund imf the world bank and the world trade organization wto two specific reference points are playing out in real time one is the u k and voices of the british people who voted to brexit the european union the second is mexico and the july 1st 2018 election of andres manuel lopez obrador aka amlo a nationalist in the u k we see the government turning more authoritarian and distancing itself from the voices of the majority who chose to rebuke the collective association of the eu in recent decisions the government has taken a more harsh approach toward suppressing opposition and as a consequence oppressing free speech and civil liberties this doesn t come as a surprise to those who have followed the arc of history when the collective global elite are challenged or rejected globalism can only thrive amid a class structure where the elites though few in number have more controlling power over the direction of government it is not accidental the eu has appointed officials and unelected bureaucrats in brussels as the primary decision making authority by its very nature the eu collective requires a central planning authority who can act independent of the underlying national voices as the trump doctrine clashes with the european global elite the withdrawal of the u s financial underwriting creates a natural problem subsidies are needed to retain multiculturalism if a national citizenry has to pay for the indulgent decisions of the influence class a crisis becomes only a matter of time wealth distribution requires a host since the end of world war ii the u s has been a bottomless treasury for eu subsidy the payments have been direct and indirect the indirect have been via u s military bases providing security the nato alliance and also by u s trade policy permitting one way tariff systems both forms of indirect payment are now being reversed as part of the modern trump doctrine similarly in mexico the trump doctrine also extends toward changed trade policies this time via nafta the restructuring of nafta into the usmca disfavors multinational corporations and financial holdings who have exploited structural loopholes that were designed into the original agreement with president trump confronting the nafta fatal flaw and absent of the ability of corporations to influence the direction of the administration the trade deal ultimately presents the same outcome for mexico as it does the eu less dollars however in mexico the larger systems of government are not as strongly structured to withstand the withdrawal of billions of u s dollars the government of mexico is not in the same position as the eu and cannot double down on more oppressive controls therefore the authentic voice of the mexican people is likely to rise andres manuel lopez obrador amlo is a nationalist but he is not a free market capitalist amlo is more akin to soft socialist approach with a view that when the central governing authority is constrained and operates in the best interests of its citizens equity can be achieved the fabric of socialism runs naturally through the dna strain of mexico and indeed much of south america this is one of the reasons why previous mexican governments were so corrupt multinational corporations always find it easier to exploit socialist minded government officials when bribery and graft are the natural way of business engagement the multinationals will exploit every opportunity to maximize profit withdraw the benefit loophole exploitation to the financial systems and the bribery and graft dries up quickly a bottom up nationalist like amlo is the ultimate beneficiary the authentic sense of the mexican people rises in the persona of andres manuel lopez obrador who actually does personify the underlying nature of the classic mexican class struggle thus we see two similar yet distinct outcomes of the trump doctrine within a highly structured u k parliamentary government the leadership becomes more authoritarian and rebukes the electorate and in mexico a less structured government becomes more nationalist more prideful and embraces the underlying nature of the electorate it is not accidental the historic nature of the u k is a monarchy top down and the historic nature of mexico is populist bottom up revolution not withstanding both countries are now returning to their roots we are indeed living in historic times

warren buffett admitted he was wrong about deficits wish he had figured this out before 2009 when the obama administration was afraid of launching a big enough stimulus package from his annual shareholders letter sadly aside from axios i don t seen this point getting the attention it deserves but maybe too many heads would explode were that to happen and to the extent the twitterverse has taken notice it s goldbugs and bitcoin fans up in arms that buffett has dissed a non prodcutive non dollar asset in fact buffett could have gone further in terms of recognizing the necessity of federal deficits when companies are under investing as they have been doing chronically since the early 1980s but his becoming an official agnostic is a big step in the right direction for a longer form explanation see this section of a post we wrote with rob parenteau in 2010 a series of disappointing data releases in recent weeks including flagging consumer confidence and meager private sector job growth is leading more and more experts to worry that the recession in the us and abroad is coming back at the same time many policymakers particularly in the eurozone are slashing government budgets which they contend will lower debt levels and thereby restore investor confidence reduce interest rates and promote growth yet many miss the fact that fiscal deficits are a nearly inevitable result of actions by corporations and households failure to understand these dynamics and address root causes is sure to make a bad situation worse unbeknownst to most commentators corporations in the us and many advanced economies have been underinvesting for some time the normal state of affairs is for households to save for large purchases retirement and emergencies and for businesses to tap those savings via borrowings or equity investments to help fund the expansion of their businesses but many economies have abandoned that pattern for instance imf and world bank studies found a reduced reinvestment rate of profits in many asian nations following the 1998 crisis similarly a 2005 jpmorgan report noted with concern that since 2002 us corporations on average ran a net financial surplus of 1 7 percent of gdp which contrasted with an average deficit of 1 2 percent of gdp for the preceding forty years companies as a whole historically ran fiscal surpluses meaning in aggregate they saved rather than expanded in economic downturns not expansion phases the big culprit in america is that public companies are obsessed with quarterly earnings investing in future growth often reduces profits short term the enterprise has to spend money say on additional staff or extra marketing before any new revenues come in the door and for bolder initiatives like developing new products the up front costs can be considerable marketing research product design prototype development legal expenses associated with patents lining up contractors thus a fall in business investment short circuits a major driver of growth in capitalist economies companies while claiming they maximize shareholder value increasingly prefer to pay their executives exorbitant bonuses or issue special dividends to shareholders or engage in financial speculation they turn their backs on the traditional role of a capitalist to find and exploit profitable opportunities to expand his activities some may argue that lower investment rates are the result of poor prospects but the data does not support that view corporate profits have risen as a share of gdp since the early 1980s reaching unprecedented levels right before the global financial crisis took hold even now us profit margins are nearly two thirds of the way back to their prior cyclical high despite a subpar recovery what happens when corporations on balance are saving and households in aggregate try to save too families and individuals typically tighten their belts and bolster their bank accounts in bad times the tendency is even more acute now since many are trying to pay down borrowings which is a form of saving if households and corporations are both saving it must be balanced by the other two sectors of the economy the government sector and the import expert secto in other words the foreign and government sectors must spend more cash than they are taking in in lay terms that means running a trade surplus and having the government incur budget deficits therefore when both domestic households and the corporate sector are saving at the same time then you need to have a very large trade surplus a very large government deficit or some combination of the two there is no other way to square this circle anyone who tries to tell you otherwise does not understand double entry book keeping which the west has used for at least the last five centuries with some success and what if a government embarks on an austerity program in the face of private sector efforts to deleverage income growth will stall and if the austerity program is large or sustained long enough falling household wages and business profits can result that result might not sound bad since lower wages and prices would make us goods more competitive abroad but in economies suffering from a debt hangover as incomes fall it becomes even harder to make payments on outstanding loans defaults and bankruptcies cascade through the financial system leading to even more reluctance to borrow and lend in other words the result of austerian fiscal policies is deflation falling wages and prices which can easily snowball into a depression

president trump has been executing a foreign policy a clear doctrine of sorts where national security is achieved by leveraging u s economic power it is a fundamental shift in approaching both allies and adversaries summarized within the oft repeated phrase economic security is national security the trump doctrine of using economics to achieve national security objectives is a fundamental paradigm shift modern u s history provides no easy reference peace is the prize president donald trump the nature of the trump foreign policy doctrine as it has become visible is to hold manipulative influence agents accountable for regional impact s and simultaneously work to stop any corrupted influence from oppressing free expression of national values held by the subservient dis empowered people within the nation being influenced there have been clear examples of this doctrine at work when president trump first visited the middle east he confronted the international audience with a message about dealing with extremist influence agents president trump simply said drive them out toward that end as qatar was identified as a financier of extremist ideology president trump placed the goal of confrontation upon the gulf cooperation council not the u s the u s role was clearly outlined as supporting the confrontation saudi arabia kuwait egypt bahrain and the united arab emirates needed to confront the toxic regional influence the u s would support their objective that s what happened another example to confront the extremism creating the turmoil in afghanistan president trump placed the burden of bringing the taliban to the table of governance upon primary influence agent pakistan here again with u s support pakistan is the leading influence agent over the taliban in afghanistan the trump administration correctly established the responsibility and gives clear expectations for u s support if pakistan doesn t change their influence objective toward a more constructive alignment with a nationally representative afghanistan government it is pakistan who will be held accountable again the correct and effective appropriation of responsibility upon the influence agent who can initiate the solution pakistan the process of accurate regional assignment of influence comes with disconcerting sunlight often these influences are not discussed openly however for president trump the lack of honesty is only a crutch to continue enabling poor actors this is a consistent theme throughout all of president trump s foreign policy engagements the european union is a collective co dependent enabler to the corrupt influences of iran therefore the assignment of responsibility to change the status is placed upon the eu the u s will fully support the eu effort but as seen in the withdrawal from the iran deal the u s will not enable growth of toxic behavior the u s stands with the people of iran but the u s will not support the enabling of iranian oppression terrorism and or dangerous military expansion that will ultimately destabilize the region trump holds the eu accountable for influencing change again we see the trump doctrine at work perhaps the most obvious application of the trump doctrine is found in how the u s administration approached the challenging behavior of north korea rather than continuing a decades long policy of ignoring the influence of china president trump directly assigned primary responsibility for a reset to beijing china held and holds all influence upon north korea and has long treated the dprk as a proxy province to do the bidding of beijing s communist old guard by directly confronting the influence agent and admitting openly for the world to see albeit with jaw dropping tactical sanction diplomacy president trump positioned the u s to support a peace objective on the entire korean peninsula and simultaneously forced china to openly display their closely guarded influence while the red dragon vs panda influence dynamic is still ongoing the benefit of this new and strategic approach has brought the possibility of peace closer than ever in recent history no longer is it outlandish to think of north korea joining with the rest of the world in achieving a better quality of life for its people not only is president trump openly sharing a willingness to engage in a new and dynamic future for north korea but his approach is removing the toxic influences that have held down the possibility for generations by leveraging china through economics to stop manipulating north korea president trump is opening up a door of possibilities for the north korean people this is what i mean when i say trump is providing north korea with an opportunity to create an authentic version of itself what ultimately comes from the opportunity president trump has constructed is entirely unknown however the opportunity itself is stunning progress creating a reasonable pathway to prosperity for the north korean people chairman kim jong un has the opportunity to be the most trans formative leader within asia in generations but it is still only an opportunity whether kim jong un can embrace openness free markets and prosperity is yet to be seen freedom is a precariously scary endeavor because there s always a danger loosening the grip on control can lead to fear which can lead to even tighter more authoritarian control the commonality in these foreign policy engagements is the strategic placement of responsibility upon the primary influence agent and a clear understanding upon those nation s of influence that all forward efforts must ultimately provide positive results for people impacted who lack the ability to create positive influence themselves one of the reasons president trump is able to take this approach is specifically because he is beholden to no outside influence himself it is only from the position of complete independence that accurate assignments based on the underlying truth can be made and that takes us to the ultimate confrontations the trillion dollar confrontations a u s foreign policy that provides the opportunity for fully realized national authenticity is a paradigm shift amid a world that has grown accustomed to corrupt globalists bankers and financial elites who have established a business model by dictating terms to national leaders they control and influence we have our own frame of reference with k street lobbyists in washington dc much of president trump s global trade reset is based on confronting these multinational influence agents when you take the influence of corporate financial brokers out of foreign policy all of a sudden those global influence peddlers are worthless absent of their ability to provide any benefit nations no longer purchase these brokered services as soon as influence brokers are dispatched national politicians become accountable to the voices of their citizens when representing the voices of citizens becomes the primary political driver of national policy the authentic image of the nation is allowed to surface in western or what we would call more democratized systems of government the consequence of removing multinational corporate and financial influence peddlers presents two options for the governing authority occupying political office one option is to refuse to allow the authentic voice of a nationalist citizenry to rise essentially to commit to a retention of the status quo an elitist view a globalist perspective this requires shifting to a more openly authoritarian system of government within both the economic and social spheres those who control the reigns of power refuse to acquiesce to a changed landscape the second option is to allow the authentic and organic rise of nationalism to accept the voices of the middle class majority to structure the economic and social landscape in a manner that allows the underlying identity to surface naturally fortunately we are living in a time of great history and we have multiple examples surfacing around the world national elections in poland hungary italy brazil and right here in the u s via donald trump highlight responses to dysfunctional multiculturalism and financial influences from corrupt elites within the institutions of globalist advocacy the international monetary fund imf the world bank and the world trade organization wto two specific reference points are playing out in real time one is the u k and voices of the british people who voted to brexit the european union the second is mexico and the july 1st 2018 election of andres manuel lopez obrador aka amlo a nationalist in the u k we see the government turning more authoritarian and distancing itself from the voices of the majority who chose to rebuke the collective association of the eu in recent decisions the government has taken a more harsh approach toward suppressing opposition and as a consequence oppressing free speech and civil liberties this doesn t come as a surprise to those who have followed the arc of history when the collective global elite are challenged or rejected globalism can only thrive amid a class structure where the elites though few in number have more controlling power over the direction of government it is not accidental the eu has appointed officials and unelected bureaucrats in brussels as the primary decision making authority by its very nature the eu collective requires a central planning authority who can act independent of the underlying national voices as the trump doctrine clashes with the european global elite the withdrawal of the u s financial underwriting creates a natural problem subsidies are needed to retain multiculturalism if a national citizenry has to pay for the indulgent decisions of the influence class a crisis becomes only a matter of time wealth distribution requires a host since the end of world war ii the u s has been a bottomless treasury for eu subsidy the payments have been direct and indirect the indirect have been via u s military bases providing security the nato alliance and also by u s trade policy permitting one way tariff systems both forms of indirect payment are now being reversed as part of the modern trump doctrine similarly in mexico the trump doctrine also extends toward changed trade policies this time via nafta the restructuring of nafta into the usmca disfavors multinational corporations and financial holdings who have exploited structural loopholes that were designed into the original agreement with president trump confronting the nafta fatal flaw and absent of the ability of corporations to influence the direction of the administration the trade deal ultimately presents the same outcome for mexico as it does the eu less dollars however in mexico the larger systems of government are not as strongly structured to withstand the withdrawal of billions of u s dollars the government of mexico is not in the same position as the eu and cannot double down on more oppressive controls therefore the authentic voice of the mexican people is likely to rise andres manuel lopez obrador amlo is a nationalist but he is not a free market capitalist amlo is more akin to soft socialist approach with a view that when the central governing authority is constrained and operates in the best interests of its citizens equity can be achieved the fabric of socialism runs naturally through the dna strain of mexico and indeed much of south america this is one of the reasons why previous mexican governments were so corrupt multinational corporations always find it easier to exploit socialist minded government officials when bribery and graft are the natural way of business engagement the multinationals will exploit every opportunity to maximize profit withdraw the benefit loophole exploitation to the financial systems and the bribery and graft dries up quickly a bottom up nationalist like amlo is the ultimate beneficiary the authentic sense of the mexican people rises in the persona of andres manuel lopez obrador who actually does personify the underlying nature of the classic mexican class struggle thus we see two similar yet distinct outcomes of the trump doctrine within a highly structured u k parliamentary government the leadership becomes more authoritarian and rebukes the electorate and in mexico a less structured government becomes more nationalist more prideful and embraces the underlying nature of the electorate it is not accidental the historic nature of the u k is a monarchy top down and the historic nature of mexico is populist bottom up revolution not withstanding both countries are now returning to their roots we are indeed living in historic times

financial results for the six months ended 31 december 2018 sasol recorded a satisfactory operational and financial performance against the backdrop of a volatile macroeconomic environment and an uncertain geo political climate which impacted global demand growth our production and sales performance was mixed with largely lower than expected production in the first half of the financial year mainly as a result of the longer than planned total shutdown at our secunda synfuels operations sso however our operational performance was enhanced by management interventions in previous periods resulting in improved performances at natref and sasol mining post the shutdowns we are pleased to see steady progress across our value chains said joint president and chief executive officer bongani nqwababa as always we remain focused on our key controllable factors with safety reliability of operations and cost control being paramount our continuous improvement ci programme will be a key feature to deliver future value to shareholders and improve our cost competitive advantage this initiative is driven with the same discipline and rigour that allowed us to deliver and exceed expectations on our business performance enhancement programme and response plan target our underlying cash generation remains sound with earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation ebitda increasing by 10 to r27 billion when compared to the prior period and normalised cash fixed cost contained to below our inflation target our earnings growth was however slower than expected due to volatility in the oil price and lower than expected production and sales volumes as we are in the commissioning phase of the lccp production units the delay in income from these units will result in lower earnings due to costs being recognised without corresponding revenues while the lccp fundamentals remain firmly intact we acknowledge the disappointing cost and schedule overrun the project was impacted by several challenges within and beyond our control in the fourth quarter of the previous calendar year despite incremental cash flows from the project being deferred due to a schedule delay we remain confident that the project will deliver the steady ebitda run rate of us 1 3 billion in financial year 2022 said joint president and chief executive officer stephen cornell he added that while this update will have an impact on our cash flow inflection point and gearing sasol continues to proactively protect its balance sheet while managing the capital structure and gearing during these turbulent times our short term focus remains on productivity in the field process safety and progressing units to mechanical completion followed by beneficial operation the linear low

will deliver value to all stakeholders earnings attributable to shareholders for the period ended 31 december 2018 increased by 114 to r14 7 billion from r6 9 billion in the prior period largely due to the significant re measurement items recorded in the prior period headline earnings per share heps increased by 32 to r23 25 per share and earnings per share eps increased by 112 to r23 92 per share compared to the prior period core headline earnings per share cheps increased by 18 to r21 45 per share compared to the prior period mainly as a result of higher average crude and product prices the effect of the weaker rand us dollar exchange rate and higher margins in specialty chemicals measured in rand terms this was partially offset by lower than expected production and sales volumes due to the extended shutdown at sso and external ethylene supply constraints which impacted our european operations post the shutdowns we are seeing much improved production in all of our units with sso performing at run rates indicative of 7 8 million tons mt per annum we expect steady progress in the second half and production to be in line with previous market guidance sasol s core headline

khanyisa share based payment lccp ramp up depreciation reversal of provision for tax litigation matters operational performance sasol experienced some challenges with regards to our operational performance in the first quarter of the year largely due to the extended planned shutdown at sso which impacted production and sales volumes across the value chain we did however deliver a stronger operational performance in the second quarter of the year and are maintaining stable operations our current production run rates at sso support an annualised run rate of 7 8 million tons in europe our operations maintained their good performance but were affected by external ethylene supply constraints which impacted sales volumes operational highlights the highlights of our operational performance are summarised as follows mining s productivity continues to improve although we have not yet achieved targeted productivity levels our productivity rate improved by 8 from 1 099 t cm s in the prior period to 1 187 t cm s in december 2018 supply to our internal value chain remains sufficient and our stock pile has been restored to levels above our working capital target we are now planning to reduce external purchases to pre 2017 strike levels supply to our internal value chain remains sufficient and our stock pile has been restored to levels above our working capital target we are now planning to reduce external purchases to pre 2017 strike levels production volumes from our eurasian operations decreased by 8 mainly resulting from external ethylene feedstock supply shortages and planned shutdowns oryx gtl continued to deliver an exceptional performance with an average utilisation rate of 99 natref improved its performance by 43 and achieved a production run rate of 641m 3 h h the planned steam station 2 shutdown at sasolburg operations so was completed ahead of schedule and achieved stable operations post the shutdown a detailed study was undertaken that proved the viability of specific so assets which are not gas dependent to have a useful life beyond 2034 the useful life of these assets was therefore extended to 2050 liquid fuels sales volumes increased 4 enabled by the strong performance from natref and increased sales to wholesale and commercial customers sales volumes from our performance chemicals business decreased by 3 mainly as a result of a force majeure in europe triggered by external ethylene supply constraints and triggered by external ethylene supply constraints and base chemicals sales volumes decreased by 11 impacted by the

indicated previously sasol is targeting a longer term sustainable inflation rate of 6 our net cash position decreased by 7 from r17 billion in june 2018 to r16 billion as at 31 december 2018 mainly due to the funding requirements of the lccp loans raised during the period amounted to r28 billion mainly for funding of our growth projects during the period we utilised an additional us 1 7 billion of the us 3 9 billion revolving credit facility rcf in order to meet the group s funding requirements in addition in september 2018 sasol raised bonds in the us capital markets to the value of us 1 5 billion maturity in 2024 and us 0 75 billion maturity in 2028 respectively the proceeds of the bonds were used to repay a portion of the outstanding lccp project asset finance facility working capital increased r2 1 billion from june 2018 mostly as a result of higher feedstock prices inventory holding in days reduced by 11 compared to june 2018 cash generated by operating activities increased by 79 to r25 billion compared with r14 billion in the prior period this is largely attributable to favourable brent crude oil and product prices and a weaker rand us dollar exchange rate actual capital expenditure amounted to r30 billion this includes r16 billion us 1 1 billion relating to the lccp our capital expenditure estimate for the full year has been revised to r52 billion largely due to optimisation of the capital portfolio due to funding of the lccp more than 85 of our debt is now us dollar denominated given the significantly weaker closing exchange rate of r14 36 gearing increased to 48 9 which is above our target and previous market guidance the exchange rate increased gearing by approximately 2 compared to our internal forecast the higher capital cash flows on the lccp during november to december 2018 further impacted gearing increasing it to 48 9 net debt to ebitda increased to 2 17 times for the same reasons while this is above our target of 2 0 times and previous market guidance our investment grade credit ratings remain intact notwithstanding the current oil price and exchange rate volatility as well as the increased expenditure on the lccp we still plan to manage the balance sheet debt metrics to within investment grade credit ratings our dividend policy is to pay dividends with a dividend cover range based on cheps taking into account the impact of the current volatile macroeconomic environment capital investment plans the current strength of our balance sheet and the dividend cover range the board has declared a gross interim dividend of r5 90 per share 18 higher compared to the prior period the dividend cover is 3 6 times at 31 december 2018 31 december 2017 3 6 times update on hedging activities sasol continues to monitor opportunities to optimally protect its trading portfolio and balance sheet the group entered into a number of hedging transactions relating to the crude oil price rand us dollar exchange rate ethane price and the coal price our hedging programme for financial year 2019 has been completed with 70 of our exposure to the rand us dollar exchange rate and 80 of our oil exposure hedged we are currently executing on our hedging programme for financial year 2020 with us 613 million of our exposure to the rand us dollar exchange rate already hedged as at 31 december 2018 in january 2019 we hedged an additional us 87 million thereby increasing our total cover to us 700 million the current ethane hedging programme is being executed to cover the existing ethane cracker in the us hedging for the lccp cracker is planned to match the start up schedule should attractive hedges become available in the market at an acceptable cost we will enter into additional hedges in mitigation against these financial risks the volumes hedged exposure and floor prices for financial years 2019 and 2020 are detailed in the analyst book available on our website www sasol com continuous improvement ci and digitalisation our group wide ci programme aimed at improving the robustness and competitiveness of our business has a medium term target to increase our return on invested capital roic for our foundation businesses by at least two percentage points by financial year 2022 the targeted roic increase is off a 30 june 2017 base normalised for remeasurement and once off items and excluding assets under construction to date we have completed industry benchmarks against our global peers for the majority of our functions and major value chains based on the outcome of these a number of value enhancing opportunities with a high probability to meet our financial year 2022 roic target have been identified approximately r2 billion of value has been unlocked with specific gross margin cash fixed costs and balance sheet initiatives in the first half of financial year 2019 this benefit was offset by the impact of production interruptions during the period digitalisation is a significant lever for our ci programme with specific focus on improving the quality and availability of data across all areas of the business to enable automation advanced analytics and improved decision making and operations we have made good progress with our focused asset review process the majority of our reviewed assets will be retained with some earmarked for growth while others will be enhanced through detailed improvement plans although the initial asset reviews are nearing completion the asset portfolio will be continuously reviewed to achieve a high grade portfolio and ensure optimal performance against our targets effective tax rate the decrease in our effective corporate tax rate from 31 6 to 24 1 was mainly as a result of the successful outcome of the sasol oil tax litigation matter resulting in the reversal of the provision of r1 3 billion the adjusted effective tax rate excluding equity accounted investments remeasurements and once off items is 29 0 compared to 26 4 in the prior period due to lower energy efficiency allowances advancing projects to enable future growth we are encouraged by the headway we are making in delivering on our project pipeline update on the lake charles chemicals project lccp as at the end of december 2018 engineering and procurement activities were substantially complete and construction progress was at 84 our overall project completion was 94 and capital expenditure amounted to us 10 9 billion the first derivative unit linear low density polyethylene lldpe reached beneficial operation on 13 february 2019 approximately two months late utilities to support the early process units were fully operational by end november 2018 these utilities together with lldpe comprised 40 of the lccp total cost prior to the revised estimate unfortunately during the last quarter of calendar 2018 several factors within and beyond our control impacted the completion schedule and associated cost for the remaining units resulting in the overall project capital cost estimate being revised from us 11 13 billion to a range of us 11 6 11 8 billion the difference between the upper and lower end of the range is a contingency and weather provision of us 200 million management maintains our unrelenting focus on delivering the remaining units per the revised schedule and we are confident that the fundamentals for the lccp being among others a feedstock advantaged plant a world scale highly integrated facility diverse product slate with high margin products and world class logistics and infrastructure remain intact we maintain our guidance that the project will deliver a steady state ebitda of us 1 3 billion in financial year 2022 focusing on our asset base in africa in mozambique the production sharing agreement psa reservoirs have proved more

this year s african economic outlook 2019 from the african development bank afdb says ethiopia will generate usd one billion by 2020 from energy exports it also states that normalization with eritrea should bring prosperity to the region the outlook shows that the continent s general economic performance continues to improve the gross domestic product reached an estimated 3 5 percent in 2018 about the same as in 2017 and up from 2 1 percent in 2016 africa s gdp growth is projected to accelerate to 4 0 percent in 2019 and 4 1 percent in 2020 the afdb outlook says even that growth is not fast enough to address persistent fiscal and current account deficits and unsustainable debt while it also describes several risks in the macroeconomic forecast including the us tension with its trading partners a further escalation of trade tensions between the united states and its main trading partners would reduce world economic growth with repercussions for africa the annual outlook stated these tensions together with the strengthening of the us dollar have increased the volatility of some commodity prices and pressured the currencies of emerging countries if global demand slows commodity prices could drop reducing gdp growth and adversely affecting trade and fiscal balances for africa s commodity exporters it added as the trade tensions between the united states and its major trading partners escalate the world trade organization estimates that growth in global trade volume could decline from 4 4 percent to 3 9 percent in 2018 and to 3 7 percent in 2019 african countries size openness to and trade intensity with the united states and china are significant more than 60 percent of africa s exports go to the united states china and europe and more than 70 percent of africa s imports originate from these countries it stated that a decline in demand for africa s exports due to a slowdown in the global economy prompted by tariffs is an important channel that could affect africa but despite the modest negative effects africa could with the right policy responses turn the increasing trade tensions into an opportunity to improve competitiveness and deepen intraregional integration it argued one way is to take advantage of the dislocation and trade diversion caused by the tensions to become the new supplier of goods previously supplied for example by china to the united states capturing even a small portion of the dislocation from increasing trade protectionism could benefit africa it added the other risk stated in the outlook is costs of external financing that could further increase if interest rates in advanced countries rise faster than assumed while extreme weather conditions due to climate change is another economic challenge for the continent political instability and security problems in some areas could weaken economies the report added further risk for the poorest continent in the world the report also states that debt levels are rising but there is no systemic risk of debt crisis in 2017 africa s gross government debt to gdp ratio reached 53 percent with considerable heterogeneity across countries inflationary pressures have eased africa s average inflation fell from 12 6 percent in 2017 to 10 9 percent in 2018 and is projected to further decline to 8 1 percent in 2020 the 2019 outlook shows that macroeconomic and employment outcomes are better when industry leads growth new research for this outlook shows that five trade policy actions could bring africa s total gains to 4 5 percent of its gdp or usd 134 billion a year first is eliminating all of today s applied bilateral tariffs in africa second is keeping rules of origin simple flexible and transparent removing all nontariff barriers on goods and services trade on a most favored nation basis and implementing the world trade organization s trade facilitation agreement to reduce the time it takes to cross borders and the transaction costs tied to nontariff measures stated as third and fourth points fifth is negotiating with other developing countries to reduce by half their tariffs and nontariff barriers on a most favored nation basis the 2019 outlook also looks at the gains possible from regional public goods such as synchronizing financial governance frameworks pooling power opening skies to competition and opening borders to free movements of people goods and services the afdb outlook indicated that in 2019 40 percent of african countries are projected to see growth of at least 5 percent the challenge is to achieve a higher growth path that is inclusive and pro employment the average current account deficit is projected to decline from 5 4 percent in 2016 to 3 percent in 2020 and the average fiscal deficit is projected to decline from 7 percent to 3 7 percent it stated that north africa leads the growth recovery but east africa remains the most dynamic region of africa s projected 4 percent growth in 2019 north africa is expected to account for 1 6 percentage points or 40 percent east africa the fastest growing region is projected to achieve growth of 5 9 percent in 2019 and 6 1 percent in 2020 between 2010 and 2018 growth averaged almost 6 percent with djibouti ethiopia rwanda and tanzania recording above average rates regarding ethiopia the outlook stated that investment investments in renewable energy will generate up to usd 1 billion in exports by 2020 political reforms and normalized relations with neighboring eritrea should boost prosperity and stabilize the region it added political reforms implemented in the last few months led to stabilization of the ethiopian economy and restored overall calm in the country the reforms focused mainly on institutionalizing democracy and rule of law and expanding the political space but these achievements are not without risks there are disruptions of economic activities in some parts of the country displacements of people in large numbers and skirmishes that could affect overall economic performance in the short to the medium term it added private sector development faces limited financial access foreign currency shortages and a costly and weak business regulatory environment frequent droughts driven by climate change have major fiscal and humanitarian consequences it says a public debt to gdp ratio of 61 8 percent at the end of june 2018 in ethiopia which is primarily is browed from china remains at high risk of debt distress according to a 2018 debt sustainability analysis

financial results for the six months ended 31 december 2018 sasol recorded a satisfactory operational and financial performance against the backdrop of a volatile macroeconomic environment and an uncertain geo political climate which impacted global demand growth our production and sales performance was mixed with largely lower than expected production in the first half of the financial year mainly as a result of the longer than planned total shutdown at our secunda synfuels operations sso however our operational performance was enhanced by management interventions in previous periods resulting in improved performances at natref and sasol mining post the shutdowns we are pleased to see steady progress across our value chains said joint president and chief executive officer bongani nqwababa as always we remain focused on our key controllable factors with safety reliability of operations and cost control being paramount our continuous improvement ci programme will be a key feature to deliver future value to shareholders and improve our cost competitive advantage this initiative is driven with the same discipline and rigour that allowed us to deliver and exceed expectations on our business performance enhancement programme and response plan target our underlying cash generation remains sound with earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation ebitda increasing by 10 to r27 billion when compared to the prior period and normalised cash fixed cost contained to below our inflation target our earnings growth was however slower than expected due to volatility in the oil price and lower than expected production and sales volumes as we are in the commissioning phase of the lccp production units the delay in income from these units will result in lower earnings due to costs being recognised without corresponding revenues while the lccp fundamentals remain firmly intact we acknowledge the disappointing cost and schedule overrun the project was impacted by several challenges within and beyond our control in the fourth quarter of the previous calendar year despite incremental cash flows from the project being deferred due to a schedule delay we remain confident that the project will deliver the steady ebitda run rate of us 1 3 billion in financial year 2022 said joint president and chief executive officer stephen cornell he added that while this update will have an impact on our cash flow inflection point and gearing sasol continues to proactively protect its balance sheet while managing the capital structure and gearing during these turbulent times our short term focus remains on productivity in the field process safety and progressing units to mechanical completion followed by beneficial operation the linear low density polyethylene lldpe unit achieved beneficial operations on 13 february 2019 and is the first of seven lccp production units to come online our commitment to sustainable value creation for all our stakeholders is underpinned by driving our roadmap to deliver on our financial and sustainability goals as well as contributing meaningfully to inclusive growth and development of our fenceline communities we are mindful of the challenges we face however our management team is fully committed to ensuring sasol is a credible stakeholder partner with a compelling investment proposition that will deliver value to all stakeholders earnings attributable to shareholders for the period ended 31 december 2018 increased by 114 to r14 7 billion from r6 9 billion in the prior period largely due to the significant re measurement items recorded in the prior period headline earnings per share heps increased by 32 to r23 25 per share and earnings per share eps increased by 112 to r23 92 per share compared to the prior period core headline earnings per share cheps increased by 18 to r21 45 per share compared to the prior period mainly as a result of higher average crude and product prices the effect of the weaker rand us dollar exchange rate and higher margins in specialty chemicals measured in rand terms this was partially offset by lower than expected production and sales volumes due to the extended shutdown at sso and external ethylene supply constraints which impacted our european operations post the shutdowns we are seeing much improved production in all of our units with sso performing at run rates indicative of 7 8 million tons mt per annum we expect steady progress in the second half and production to be in line with previous market guidance sasol s core headline earnings were impacted by the following notable once off and period close items translation impact of closing exchange rate mark to market valuation of hedges of oil and foreign exchange hedges sasol khanyisa share based payment lccp ramp up depreciation reversal of provision for tax litigation matters operational performance sasol experienced some challenges with regards to our operational performance in the first quarter of the year largely due to the extended planned shutdown at sso which impacted production and sales volumes across the value chain we did however deliver a stronger operational performance in the second quarter of the year and are maintaining stable operations our current production run rates at sso support an annualised run rate of 7 8 million tons in europe our operations maintained their good performance but were affected by external ethylene supply constraints which impacted sales volumes operational highlights the highlights of our operational performance are summarised as follows mining s productivity continues to improve although we have not yet achieved targeted productivity levels our productivity rate improved by 8 from 1 099 t cm s in the prior period to 1 187 t cm s in december 2018 supply to our internal value chain remains sufficient and our stock pile has been restored to levels above our working capital target we are now planning to reduce external purchases to pre 2017 strike levels supply to our internal value chain remains sufficient and our stock pile has been restored to levels above our working capital target we are now planning to reduce external purchases to pre 2017 strike levels production volumes from our eurasian operations decreased by 8 mainly resulting from external ethylene feedstock supply shortages and planned shutdowns oryx gtl continued to deliver an exceptional performance with an average utilisation rate of 99 natref improved its performance by 43 and achieved a production run rate of 641m 3 h h the planned steam station 2 shutdown at sasolburg operations so was completed ahead of schedule and achieved stable operations post the shutdown a detailed study was undertaken that proved the viability of specific so assets which are not gas dependent to have a useful life beyond 2034 the useful life of these assets was therefore extended to 2050 liquid fuels sales volumes increased 4 enabled by the strong performance from natref and increased sales to wholesale and commercial customers sales volumes from our performance chemicals business decreased by 3 mainly as a result of a force majeure in europe triggered by external ethylene supply constraints and triggered by external ethylene supply constraints and base chemicals sales volumes decreased by 11 impacted by the extended shutdown at sso and lower fertiliser demand our 50 joint venture high density polyethylene plant hdpe in the us with ineos olefins and polymers usa is ramping up to expectations and delivered 91kt of saleable product for sasol for the six months cost cash and capital performance cash fixed costs excluding capital growth and once off business establishment costs increased by 4 3 which is 1 7 below our inflation target our cost management processes remain a key focus to protect and improve our competitive position while ensuring that we maintain safe and sustainable operations as indicated previously sasol is targeting a longer term sustainable inflation rate of 6 our net cash position decreased by 7 from r17 billion in june 2018 to r16 billion as at 31 december 2018 mainly due to the funding requirements of the lccp loans raised during the period amounted to r28 billion mainly for funding of our growth projects during the period we utilised an additional us 1 7 billion of the us 3 9 billion revolving credit facility rcf in order to meet the group s funding requirements in addition in september 2018 sasol raised bonds in the us capital markets to the value of us 1 5 billion maturity in 2024 and us 0 75 billion maturity in 2028 respectively the proceeds of the bonds were used to repay a portion of the outstanding lccp project asset finance facility working capital increased r2 1 billion from june 2018 mostly as a result of higher feedstock prices inventory holding in days reduced by 11 compared to june 2018 cash generated by operating activities increased by 79 to r25 billion compared with r14 billion in the prior period this is largely attributable to favourable brent crude oil and product prices and a weaker rand us dollar exchange rate actual capital expenditure amounted to r30 billion this includes r16 billion us 1 1 billion relating to the lccp our capital expenditure estimate for the full year has been revised to r52 billion largely due to optimisation of the capital portfolio due to funding of the lccp more than 85 of our debt is now us dollar denominated given the significantly weaker closing exchange rate of r14 36 gearing increased to 48 9 which is above our target and previous market guidance the exchange rate increased gearing by approximately 2 compared to our internal forecast the higher capital cash flows on the lccp during november to december 2018 further impacted gearing increasing it to 48 9 net debt to ebitda increased to 2 17 times for the same reasons while this is above our target of 2 0 times and previous market guidance our investment grade credit ratings remain intact notwithstanding the current oil price and exchange rate volatility as well as the increased expenditure on the lccp we still plan to manage the balance sheet debt metrics to within investment grade credit ratings our dividend policy is to pay dividends with a dividend cover range based on cheps taking into account the impact of the current volatile macroeconomic environment capital investment plans the current strength of our balance sheet and the dividend cover range the board has declared a gross interim dividend of r5 90 per share 18 higher compared to the prior period the dividend cover is 3 6 times at 31 december 2018 31 december 2017 3 6 times update on hedging activities sasol continues to monitor opportunities to optimally protect its trading portfolio and balance sheet the group entered into a number of hedging transactions relating to the crude oil price rand us dollar exchange rate ethane price and the coal price our hedging programme for financial year 2019 has been completed with 70 of our exposure to the rand us dollar exchange rate and 80 of our oil exposure hedged we are currently executing on our hedging programme for financial year 2020 with us 613 million of our exposure to the rand us dollar exchange rate already hedged as at 31 december 2018 in january 2019 we hedged an additional us 87 million thereby increasing our total cover to us 700 million the current ethane hedging programme is being executed to cover the existing ethane cracker in the us hedging for the lccp cracker is planned to match the start up schedule should attractive hedges become available in the market at an acceptable cost we will enter into additional hedges in mitigation against these financial risks the volumes hedged exposure and floor prices for financial years 2019 and 2020 are detailed in the analyst book available on our website www sasol com continuous improvement ci and digitalisation our group wide ci programme aimed at improving the robustness and competitiveness of our business has a medium term target to increase our return on invested capital roic for our foundation businesses by at least two percentage points by financial year 2022 the targeted roic increase is off a 30 june 2017 base normalised for remeasurement and once off items and excluding assets under construction to date we have completed industry benchmarks against our global peers for the majority of our functions and major value chains based on the outcome of these a number of value enhancing opportunities with a high probability to meet our financial year 2022 roic target have been identified approximately r2 billion of value has been unlocked with specific gross margin cash fixed costs and balance sheet initiatives in the first half of financial year 2019 this benefit was offset by the impact of production interruptions during the period digitalisation is a significant lever for our ci programme with specific focus on improving the quality and availability of data across all areas of the business to enable automation advanced analytics and improved decision making and operations we have made good progress with our focused asset review process the majority of our reviewed assets will be retained with some earmarked for growth while others will be enhanced through detailed improvement plans although the initial asset reviews are nearing completion the asset portfolio will be continuously reviewed to achieve a high grade portfolio and ensure optimal performance against our targets effective tax rate the decrease in our effective corporate tax rate from 31 6 to 24 1 was mainly as a result of the successful outcome of the sasol oil tax litigation matter resulting in the reversal of the provision of r1 3 billion the adjusted effective tax rate excluding equity accounted investments remeasurements and once off items is 29 0 compared to 26 4 in the prior period due to lower energy efficiency allowances advancing projects to enable future growth we are encouraged by the headway we are making in delivering on our project pipeline update on the lake charles chemicals project lccp as at the end of december 2018 engineering and procurement activities were substantially complete and construction progress was at 84 our overall project completion was 94 and capital expenditure amounted to us 10 9 billion the first derivative unit linear low density polyethylene lldpe reached beneficial operation on 13 february 2019 approximately two months late utilities to support the early process units were fully operational by end november 2018 these utilities together with lldpe comprised 40 of the lccp total cost prior to the revised estimate unfortunately during the last quarter of calendar 2018 several factors within and beyond our control impacted the completion schedule and associated cost for the remaining units resulting in the overall project capital cost estimate being revised from us 11 13 billion to a range of us 11 6 11 8 billion the difference between the upper and lower end of the range is a contingency and weather provision of us 200 million management maintains our unrelenting focus on delivering the remaining units per the revised schedule and we are confident that the fundamentals for the lccp being among others a feedstock advantaged plant a world scale highly integrated facility diverse product slate with high margin products and world class logistics and infrastructure remain intact we maintain our guidance that the project will deliver a steady state ebitda of us 1 3 billion in financial year 2022 focusing on our asset base in africa in mozambique the production sharing agreement psa reservoirs have proved more

i can t put this off any longer so here are the tech predictions i made a year ago for 2018 we have to see how well or poorly i did before we can move on to my predictions for 2019 and beyond these old predictions have been edited for length but not to avoid embarrassment i try to never avoid embarrassment one thing i ve noticed over the years is that my predictions get longer and longer this column alone is 4329 words my second longest ever as they have drifted from new products to explaining new strategies this sometimes works against the prediction since it is often easier to claim success if your goal is vague but i see it more as a tribute to my readers many of you have been with me for decades and the very fact that we are both still here has as much to do with the work as with its results how the future fits together is just as important as where it is heading my first prediction a year ago the rise of 5g networking will lead to a crash in broadcast tv all the mobile carriers will begin rolling out 5g wireless networking in 2018 though only about 22 percent of the country will be covered by the end of this year 5g is interesting because it will bring a huge increase in wireless bandwidth that we don t really need so what will all this 5g bandwidth be used for i predict it will replace legacy broadband providers like telco dsl and cable isps the telcos will feel this effect first every dsl vendor is ultimately doomed there s no fighting this trend so there will be a mad rush to 5g by these companies look for some of them to try to dump their wireline services entirely okay this clearly didn t happen though both network and cable tv total viewership in the usa have peaked with total subscriber numbers declining in 2018 but do you have 5g neither do i the prediction still stands but it has been pushed back by the slow 5g roll out so i was wrong but it s only a matter of time before this happens exactly as predicted my family and i were homeless for months after the fire staying with friends in airbnbs and in our 1978 gmc royale rv throughout those months we used our t mobile unlimited 4g internet for everything voip internet netflix hulu amazon prime youtube tv all it took was a usb channel 12 lte modem a mimo antenna stuck to a window with suction cups and a 40 wifi router and now that we are finally back in a house we haven t changed at all our mix of programming it may be the golden age of television but tv is dying still my over optimism about timing made me zero for one my second prediction a year ago the end of windows supremacy this is not a prediction that macos or linux will take over from windows it s more complex than that what i am seeing is that windows is becoming less and less important to microsoft and as microsoft s focus changes so will our focus as consumers of personal computing it s not surprising that microsoft is changing because desktop pc sales are down and redmond can t get much money anymore for windows upgrades under satya nadella windows phone is gone and microsoft s concentration is on in this order 1 azure microsoft s public cloud 2 azure services like storage and to some extent office 365 3 microsoft office and 4 windows that s windows going from first to fourth and microsoft office going from second to third that s huge and it happened exactly as i said one for two my third prediction a year ago sorry this one is long 2018 foreign profit repatriation part of trump s tax reform is a 591 8 billion taxpayer ripoff multinational u s companies have since 2005 squirreled away about 2 5 trillion in profits overseas because u s tax law allowed those profits to go untaxed until they are returned to the usa understand that this 2 5 trillion is more than just the profit made on overseas business many companies changed their ways of doing business to divert what would have been u s domestic profits sending them overseas for parking to await a business friendly u s administration that would cut them a sweetheart deal to bring back all that moolah the amount of u s corporate income tax that went unpaid during this 12 year period was 35 percent of 2 5 trillion or about 875 billion that s taxes of 73 billion annually for 12 years that went unpaid about five percent of the federal budget for those 12 years admittedly u s tax law was out of step with most of the rest of the world and the new law changed much of that cutting the corporate rate to a more competitive 21 percent from 35 and ending u s taxation of foreign profits entirely from 2018 on foreign taxes still apply but it is also clear that the companies keeping profits overseas won big in the repatriation deal the new tax law says companies must bring those profits home but instead of paying the 35 percent tax they d been working so hard to avoid or even the new 21 percent corporate rate those profits will be taxed at a special 15 5 percent rate saving the companies about 500 billion they would have paid under the old rules that s the 500 billion president tump says will be converted mainly into new jobs pay raises and aggressive r d yeah right this is a 591 8 billion taxpayer ripoff rather than just a 500 billion ripoff because the law allows companies to pay those back taxes over eight years they may owe 375 billion but will only have to pay this year 30 billion leaving 345 billion in essentially free money to play with money that wouldn t otherwise be available beyond the simple fact that you and i could never get a deal like this if we had gone 12 years without paying our taxes economists are pretty much in agreement that the majority of the 2 2043 trillion in net repatriated profits will be used for share buy backs propping up both earnings and stock prices the present combined market cap of all u s public companies is about 30 trillion with repatriating companies likely to buy back at least 1 5 trillion five percent of that in the near future again what s wrong with that what s wrong is we have already gone eight years without a recession and all these foreign profits going into stock buy backs will create a weird effect once the inevitable recession is upon us probably in 2019 sales will drop the economy will contract that s the definition of a recession but earnings and stock prices will remain stable or even rise as ceos and cfos pit buy backs against the recession their hope being to somehow bridge the earnings gap and get to the next period of expansion without a market drop american ceos and cfos do such things because their average tenure is just four years all of which is spent trying to ensure their own comfortable retirements with that golden parachute always an average of only two years away why not try something anything to keep share prices up and so they will and maybe just maybe it will work but more likely it won t work the next recession will start markets will at first appear to defy gravity through buy backs but eventually and inevitably what went up will come down hard it will be like 2008 all over again just in time for the next presidential election yes the multinationals got their windfalls no they didn t roll the money into new jobs raises factories and r d that was simply a lie and they are absolutely using share buy backs to extend the apparent expansion i was and continue to be right on this one which will continue in 2019 two for three my fourth prediction a year ago bitcoin stays crazy until traders learn it is not a currency 2017 was a wild ride for cryptocurrencies and for bitcoin in particular rising in price at one point above 19 000 only to drop back to a bit over half of that number now january 2018 but which number is correct if only the market can tell for sure and these numbers are coming straight from the market remember what the heck does it all mean it means bitcoin isn t a currency at all but traders are pretending that it is 2018 will see investors finally figure this out the problem with cryptocurrencies and the reason why their prices and implied underlying value are so volatile is because the basis of that value isn t the same as the basis for a real currency it s not backed by gold it s not backed by the full faith and credit of the united states of america it s not backed by well anything in that sense of innate value cryptocurrencies are worthless but this is not to say that bitcoin has no value it s just that the value is misunderstood and here s probably the most important point i am trying to make here as long as the value of bitcoin is misunderstood there will be hucksters taking advantage of suckers stealing their crypto lunch money everything in the cryptocurrency world is about the exchange rate which is to say nothing is about the actual cryptocurrency itself you see there is nothing holding the price of any legitimate cryptocurrency up or down except supply and demand and both of those are constantly changing so the smart trader knows never to hold bitcoins or at least not to hold them for very long because what went up will inevitably go down this is what makes bitcoin a horrible investment but a wonderful trade because there is money to be made in that inevitable volatility not only will what goes up come down again it will also go back up again if you wait long enough this is all because bitcoin and similar currencies aren t currencies at all but financial instruments they are tools just like options or derivatives and like good tools they perform a specific function very well reliably transferring value between parties without those parties having to meet or even know each other but once that transfer is complete then the true value of the bitcoin has effectively been used and is therefore subject to change which again explains the volatility the value of bitcoin goes up with demand on the part of those who would use it to transfer value some russian oligarch for example has heard a rumor that putin is after every ruble in his piggybank so the oligarch exchanges those rubles for bitcoins as he boards his private jet in moscow then exchanges bitcoins for u s dollars before he lands in some safer country he doesn t care much about the exchange rate because the oligarch only intends to hold the bitcoins for at most a few hours but turning 10 billion rubles into bitcoins will inevitably drive up the bitcoin spot price this is key the spot price now let s say we have that day buying bitcoins in addition to the russian oligarch a chinese industrialist a saudi prince and a nigerian con man each with cops pounding on the door and 1 billion to move asap with all that demand the bitcoin price goes higher and higher and none of these parties actually gives a damn because over the course of their trades the price only goes up a bit but to bitcoin traders and shudder bitcoin investors this rise in price looks like a rise in value so of course they jump in driving the price higher still what happens though when the big trades are all finished and the bitcoins reconverted to real currencies the price of bitcoin then drops because its utility as a financial instrument is not so urgently needed there is nothing bad or good about this price change which is perhaps most analogous to breathing in out up down that s just how cryptocurrencies operate bitcoin is worth more than the others only because it has been mined longer and there are more of them in circulation meaning greater liquidity to support larger transactions until everyone comes to understand these underlying truths there will be huge bitcoin price volatility with fortunes made and lost every day but once we all get onboard bitcoin promises to become the little trading engine that could that s because for every time we know bitcoin will go down we know that it will inevitably go back up again if you notice bitcoin is down buy it when you ve made as much profit as you need sell it then wait for bitcoin to inevitably go back down again those who have a very high risk tolerance or think they can time the market will hold on longer and be more likely to lose their shirts it s a much better bitcoin trading strategy to not be greedy living instead on the crumbs of oligarchs and conmen this is an understanding that i predict will broadly emerge in 2018 but did it actually happen as i predicted i think so the price of bitcoins has trended downward for the last year but within that there has also been a fair amount of volatility the overall downward trend represents the market starting to figure out that bitcoins priced in the thousands of dollars is nonsense that the price remains as high as it is comes down to the fact that not everyone has this figured out and the traders are really enjoying sticking it to the rubes the volatility within the downward trend is the real bitcoin going up and down as big transactions are made eventually bitcoin will settle on a price and stay near there just riding up and down on those demand waves we re not there yet but it is coming so i claim this one was correct three for four my fourth prediction a year ago the h 1b visa problem will not go away immigration reform will have little actual effect on h 1b visa abuse immigration reform is coming we re told and the trump campaign said a lot about h 1bs especially about eliminating the lottery system that is used to allocate those 65 000 yearly slots about half of those slots have gone to foreign outsourcing companies especially from india once the h 1b reform legislation appears i think we can expect the lottery to go away in favor of a system based strictly on worker qualifications and the dire need to fill the position which sounds egalitarian and terrific eh probably not you see the point of this h 1b reform will be mainly to get rid of the indian outsourcers so their h 1b slots can be used by american companies hiring directly it s for this reason that the indian companies are hiring u s citizens as fast as they can and the u s companies are preparing too by practicing all those techniques that will allow them to appear to seek qualified domestic candidates and yet not find them toward that end for example i m hearing that one big company that rhymes with ibm is starting to use recruiters whose native language is not english this is not to say that non native speakers can t learn wonderful english or be consummate h r professionals but the track record of big companies that rhyme with ibm is not good in this area for all their billions in profits and billions more in repatriated profits these companies which include biggies like apple and google just can t seem to bring themselves to pay market rates for labor if they can wriggle out of doing so the trump administration sure isn t going to make them do it either and for these reasons i predict that the h 1b visa program may change in 2018 but its problems will remain pretty much the same well what happened almost nothing we didn t get immigration reform we got troops sent to the border to protect us from marauding women and children we got a long discussion about walls and who would pay for them we got some administrative changes that made life harder for some folks and easier for others but the h 1b system remains pretty much as it was a year ago as i predicted the h 1b problem did not go away four for five my sixth prediction a year ago ai comes of age this time asking the questions too paul saffo says that communication technologies historically take 30 years or more to find their true purpose just look at how the internet today is different than it was back in 1988 i am beginning to think this idea applies also to new computing technologies like artificial intelligence ai we re reading a lot lately about ai and i think 2018 is the year when ai becomes recognized for its much deeper purpose of asking questions not just finding answers some older readers may remember the ai bubble of the mid 1980s sand hill road venture capitalists invested and lost about 1 billion in ai startups that were generally touted as expert systems alas it didn t work for two reasons 1 figuring out how experts make decisions was way harder than the ai researchers expected and 2 even if you could fully explain the decision making process it required a lot more computing power than originally expected circa 1985 it probably was cheaper to hire a doctor than to run a program to replace one but now approximately 30 years later ai has come back to life part of this is simply moore s law one million dollars worth of 1985 computational power costs less than a buck today making those software experts way cheaper to run a second reason for ai s resurgence is the availability of huge online data sets over the past 30 years nearly all the information that formerly resided on paper was reduced to electrons making true machine learning possible this can t be over emphasized anyone my age remembers when early search engines indexed thousands of web pages not billions highly technical data generally wasn t available online in any volume but now it is the third major reason for ai s resurgence is today we don t even try to pick some doctor s brain to build an expert system instead empirically deriving skills directly from the data taking this one step further we are moving to a system where we don t even start with a question just the data allowing cloud based systems to find what s learnable from the data that s allowing ai to come up with its own questions and it s the emerging trend on which i am trying to focus this prediction we re getting to the point where ai should begin to organically suggest approaches that will help us improve medical outcomes the big low buck solutions like immunizations have for the most part already happened future gains will have to come incrementally often one gene at a time but that s just where ai should shine mining medical gems from all that data in our smart phones fitness trackers and home dna tests thirty years into ai it s time to start seeing significant rewards from this approach in many fields not just medicine but did it happen as predicted is ai coming up with its own questions it is starting to and part of the reason why is simply a lack of data scientists which i didn t anticipate just to be sure about this i passed the question to kai fu lee who is ex apple silicon graphics microsoft google and quite the ai pioneer in his own right now a vc based in china kai fu published last year a popular book about artificial intelligence that prompted a column you can read here and below you ll find his opinion on whether i was correct about prediction five i think it would be fair to say that yes it did begin to happen today using ai to help on drug discovery is one of the most popular areas of research as well as vc funded work also ai diagnosis on lung cancer skin cancer by reading mri or ct have shown that they can do better than average doctors these promising early results and influx of money of course do not guarantee solutions solutions may still take a long time but given your question is did it begin to happen i think the answer is yes kai fu five for six my prediction 7 for 2018 there will appear the first alexa virus this one was courtesy of my son fallon then 11 who is a pretty good strategic thinker fallon s idea for a computer virus is that it should be possible to create otherwise benign alexa skills that when used together can make trouble think about it there are presently more than 15 000 alexa skills that have been officially approved by amazon and are available for download these skills do everything from launching programs to gathering data to setting reminders though relatively simple each is still a cloud app that can connect tens of millions of echo products to amazon web services aws each alexa skill is tested by amazon before being approved but are they tested together they don t appear to be one skill for example could open a communication session while another could gather audio or video data for spying one skill could take control of the echo while another could put the resulting bot to terrible use in a local network or on the internet as a whole i m sure you can imagine any number of clever combinations remember the combinations don t have to be operating on the same echo device to function cooperatively this makes them even harder to detect did it happen were amazon echo devices and similar hacked in 2018 well there is a so called alexa virus loose in the world though that apparently has nothing to do with alexa devices but a group of chinese hackers demonstrated last summer their ability to turn your echo into a listening device at the defcon security conference in las vegas so yes alexa devices have been hacked six for seven my prediction 8 for 2018 apple will buy one or more of the many startups helping shift desktop computing loads to the cloud cupertino will compete with amazon google and microsoft offering virtual cloud pcs just as with prediction one this is wrong but only because apple is moving slower than i expected with cupertino s ever stronger orientation on services don t be surprised to see this still happen sooner rather than later but for now it s still wrong six for eight my prediction 9 for 2018 ginni rometty will this year be replaced as ibm ceo this should have been a no brainer yet ginni is still running ibm so this is wrong but i d be willing to bet that this is the first of my ibm predictions that ms rometty has ever wanted to be true here s the deal the rule at ibm has been for more than 100 years that unless your last name was watson all ibm ceos retired at 60 only tom watson senior and junior defied this trend until now ginni rometty turned 60 last summer and i am sure she would like to be on a golf course somewhere but what s keeping her on the job is ibm s still listless financial performance it s many legal problems age discrimination suits anyone and the fact that ginni hasn t been able to yet jack her retirement package up into the stratospheric numbers pioneered by her predecessor sam palmisano sam lucked out and ginni is paying the price i don t know if ginni will retire in 2019 or not it really depends on that golden parachute which will require a few more quarters of profit growth well at least one more going for two or three out of 25 or so consecutive quarters before ginni pulls that rip cord buying red hat helps though that purchase won t close until the second half of this year maybe ginni s career will close with it thousands of current and former ibmers certainly hope so still the prediction was wrong for 2018 six for nine my final prediction for 2018 facebook s mark zuckerberg will give up his political ambitions what you didn t know zuck wanted to be president i m pretty sure he once did have such a goal and heck if trump could do it why not a younger smarter guy whose wealth is real zuckerberg s recent listening tours were all a part of his very deliberate transformation from geek to statesman alas it won t work and it didn t for several reasons enough reason that i think some explanation is required zuckerberg s political ambitions would have been nuked in the short term by facebooks incredibly stupid customer privacy blunders that are apparently about to cost the company a multi billion dollar fine from the federal trade commission you can t assist in the manipulation of a national election knowingly or unknowingly and expect that to be quickly forgiven by voters but even beyond facebook s obvious screw ups zuckerberg s experiences testifying before congress last year showed everyone including zuck that he just isn t cut out for political office his skin is way too thin the problem for zuckerberg isn t that he couldn t do the job it s that the personal cost is too high presidents have no privacy their every move is criticized and for a guy like zuckerberg who likes to be in control there s damned little control actually available he s started to realize this just as facebook needed more attention during the fake news and russian election tampering crises which have been brutal for facebook i got this one right so i ended up the year seven for 10 or 70 percent correct historically i ve average about seventy percent correct over the last 20 or so years so 2018 was about average but i also think this was the first year when every one of my failed predictions is still likely to come true so i may come back at some point asking for a recount but enough of 2018 in my next column i ll turn to my startling and depressing predictions for 2019 and beyond yum

by alex otti inflation is when you pay fifteen dollars for the ten dollar haircut you used to get for five dollars when you had hair sam ewing credit for the title of today s treatise goes to professor milton friedman 1912 2006 the 1978 economics nobel laureate belonged to the chicago school of economists who came up strongly against the theories of john maynard keynes and advocated for minimal government intervention and subsequently developed the economic theory known as monetarism monetarism posits that money supply is the most important driver of economic growth accordingly as money supply increases people tend to demand more consequently factories produce more thus creating new jobs a major drawback to monetarism however surfaced with the global recession in 2001 when it became apparent that liquidity which includes credit cash and money market instruments are not necessarily measured by central banks for the ordinary man on the street inflation is what occurs when the money in his pocket fetches less goods than it previously did more money therefore begins to chase fewer goods in the satirical description of the effect of inflation on a salaried worker it is the situation in which at first there is so much money left at the end of the month and later there is so much month left at the end of the money in technical terms inflation is a quantitative representation of the upward direction of general price level of goods and services over a certain period of time it is a relative number that speaks to the price level between one date and another it is a key economic indicator the strategic nature of which is bellied in the underlying factors that drive its outcomes the idea of average price level implies that a select basket of goods and services will be tracked and measured to have a fair representation therefore the selected goods and services whose prices are tracked over a specific period must be representative of what people typically spend on every day price level could go up or come down when it goes up it is said to be inflationary but when it comes down it is deflationary inflation therefore does not only affect the prices of things in the market but also purchasing power because if income remains the same in an inflationary environment you are able to buy less over time as things get more expensive the question though is what drives inflation there are basically three factors that drive inflation and these are generally stated as follows the first is when the demand for specific goods and services increases faster than the production capacity of such goods in the economy the goods and services thus become scarcer and consumers will be willing to pay more to have them this creates a demand supply gap that pushes prices higher this situation will also happen when there is increased money supply to individuals in the system that is not supported by economic value also an increase in the money supply by the monetary authorities increases the consumption capacity of the population which will create a scenario where people spend more from more money in their possession resulting in price increases while these can be the result of a natural economic occurrence it could also be artificial a good example was during the udoji award of 1974 when there was a sharp increase in the salaries of workers this led to huge demand for certain types of goods and a consequent increase in their prices if a cartel like opec decides to cut production of crude into the market prices are likely to go up for crude and therefore petroleum product pushing prices up this phenomenon arises from artificial factors however increases in demand for energy as a result of economic growth or weather condition would result in a demand pull that will definitely push prices up increase in the prices of the cost of production could also push prices up in nigeria where a lot of our manufacturing inputs are imported a devaluation of the local currency is a major contributor to a cost increase that will result in increase in the price of finished goods still on this if for some reason the average price level goes up in the country from where we import finished goods or inputs we are bound to import that inflationary pressure into our domestic economy and transfer the consequences to final consumers in fact it is for this reason that countries that meet a large proportion of their needs through local sources do not worry so much about exchange rates indeed for a country like china where they produce for export the devaluation of the yuan makes such exports cheaper to the foreign buyers and thus they become competitive relative to others this is actually one of the major issues of conflict between the usa and china the former believes that through currency manipulation in which the latter s currency is deliberately weakened such goods sold in yuan become preferred inadequate or deteriorating infrastructure whether it is power logistics storage or other facilities tends to push production costs up as well as increasing risks and therefore risk mitigating expenditures that naturally increase cost of goods and services also demand for specific inputs as described above may increase faster than its production rate other cost increases like raw materials will generally contribute to increases in costs in nigeria today it is said that the scourge of inadequate power supply adds about 40 per cent to the cost of production a third driver of inflation could be collectively referred to as those costs that tend to increase as a result of expectations resulting from inflationary forces themselves this will relate largely to the cost of living and reduction in purchasing power arising from a general increase in the cost of living that then calls for a lift in living wages thus increasing costs of production and cost of finished goods agitations by labour groups for salary increases and the improvement in minimum wages which is imminent in nigeria are just some of those factors that may fuel inflationary pressure it should be observed that all the factors driving inflation seem to be related and interactive as one driver tends to induce another this is why inflation needs to be managed by experts as it has the potential to spiral and become a vicious cycle it is usually the objective by respective economic managers in different jurisdictions to manage inflation by moderating it rather than eliminating it every economy experiences inflationary pressures from time to time and a little bit of it could arguably be said to be good for any economy economic theory allows a tolerable inflation rate of between 2 to 3 per annum for the economy this theory insists that it is necessary for growth and equilibrium employment level however when the rates begin to burst those limits the managers of the economy should have cause to worry while inflation is natural to economic activities it is the manner in which it is managed that delivers a great or bad outcome in business and the economy in general if we agree that businesses are all about prices and how they are managed and that prices are at the core of whether businesses do well by making a profit or not then it will be a great idea to discuss a bit as to how businesses should respond to inflation the question is that if i know that prices will go up by an inflation rate in a year s time how should i set my price today if for example my cost of production is n10 000 and i intend to sell at a profit of 20 it means i would sell for n12 000 at today s prices if inflation rate is however 10 it would mean the cost at which i can produce the same item next year will be n11 000 meaning that my effective profit will be n1 000 instead of n2 000 effectively therefore even though i have planned a profit margin of 20 my real margin is 10 after factoring in the effect of inflation i have of course assumed that demand and other possible variables are held constant inflation tends to force investment and define a hurdle rate for returns on investments and savings returns must exceed at the minimum the inflation rate in the economy otherwise you will have a negative return on your investment it also shows that holding cash except for the purpose of managing risks associated with meeting liquidity requirements of the business is undesirable as cash holding definitely will lose its purchasing power it should also be realized that price is also used as a means for managing household behavior and the economy generally when prices are high household consumption of goods and services will be restrained and when prices are low consumption tends to escalate if this is not well managed it could induce more inflation as demand for goods tend to grow faster than production pushing up prices again even if momentarily if well managed it could stimulate economic activities and support production and growth maintaining a dynamic balance will always be the answer it is also important to point out that inflation is a constant feature in every capitalist system as it is one of the key factors that encourage investment and business one thing that is always undesirable however is the very high and unstable inflation rates due to its negative impact on the economy it brings uncertainty to economic and business projections and planning thereby increasing risk and reducing the attractiveness for further investment it will not be out of place to evaluate the nigerian situation and how our culture and systems respond to some of these global principles power this is a major input into the basket of cost that fuels inflation even though the cost of input materials has increased greatly due to the local currency value vis a vis the dollar cost of operations and financing cost the federal government through the regulatory agency the nigerian energy regulation commission nerc has been unable to approve increased prices in line with myto multi year tariff order generally we have also not learnt to moderate our use of energy in an efficient manner unlike in other economies citizens are not very sensitive to their energy consumption to control their cost we leave our air conditioners on and go to work we leave lights on in rooms that are unoccupied the whole idea of energy conservation is lost on us clearly this behavior frustrates investment in the sector we can argue all we like about meter and the non availability of power if price is uneconomic it is difficult to make the required investments that will change the situation a discussion for another day though petroleum products it was argued earlier that when prices go up behavior is moderated we have witnessed the prices of petroleum products go up mostly and seldom down yet we continue to use our cars at the same levels we drive the cars to the super market next door and put no pressure on our government for an efficient public transport system it was the mayor of bogota penalosa that said an advanced city is not one where even the poor use cars but rather one where even the rich use public transportation this thinking is alien to us in nigeria even the idea of carpooling or ride sharing to conserve energy and save cost is strange to us here like in the case of power whether the prices go up or come down the price to us remains the same we have therefore lost the efficiencies and discipline that price brings cost of capital lending rate or the price at which corporations and individuals borrow from banks is a key stimulator for economic growth financing is a common denominator to every growing enterprise if the cost of credit goes down the viability of several projects and profitability of several companies can be taken for granted mortgage loans for example are unsustainable at double digit interest rates which is not uncommon in nigeria these rates technically mean that the cost of a typical piece of property theoretically doubles every five to six years in what world is this a sustainable proposition i admit that there are many factors that add to the cost of credit for banks but inflation is one of them and a major one at that however it would appear that although inflation rate came down from 18 7 in 2017 to 11 44 in 2018 it made no difference to the lending rate which continued at an average of 24 pa matters have also not been helped by the monetary policy rate which has remained at 14 for the last few years what this means is that in the nigerian economy there is no relationship between interest rates and inflation rate a reduction in mpr would at least show a clear signal of the direction lending rates should go while at the same time discouraging banks from holding their excess funds in government securities and other risk free instruments the private sector has therefore continued to groan under the very high cost of credit in nigeria that seems to hold out irrespective of where inflation goes the point is that as a people we are yet to understand the phenomenon of inflation and how we can use it to our collective and individual advantage we continue to lose the opportunity to make adjustments to our pricing regime for some key commodities we seem unresponsive to inflation trends and there is no conservation no response no reallocation of resources or change in behavior regardless of which way inflation goes elsewhere it is seen as a monster that must be caged the 40th american president ronald reagan regarded unchecked inflation is as being violent as a mugger as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hit man

most business economists predict the u s will fall into a recession within the next two years a new survey finds about half of the 280 business economists polled said they expect a downturn by the end of next year roughly 75 percent say it will happen by 2021 only 11 percent anticipate the u s avoiding a recession during that two year window according to a february survey from the national association for business economics released monday the u s is deep into an economic expansion which began in summer 2009 after the financial crisis if the expansion lasts until june it would be the nation s longest though the economy has been robust marked by strong consumer spending climbing markets and the lowest unemployment rates in decades signs of a slowdown have surfaced recent months have seen dizzying volatility in the markets and a sudden drop off in consumer confidence trade tensions between the u s and china have taken a toll on economic growth in the u s and abroad shadows of a slowdown have put pressure on the federal reserve as it tries to price out interest rate increases in january federal reserve chairman jerome powell said the economy has good momentum and that he didn t foresee a recession in 2019 but he signaled the fed would be patient about raising rates as economic growth is expected to fall from the roughly 3 percent of last year to 2 3 percent this year the fed raised rates four times in 2018 although the federal reserve s rate hikes have been a source of ire for president donald trump who has blamed the central bank and powell for raising rates too quickly and disrupting the stock market most economists in the nabe endorse the fed s actions business economists continue to approve of current monetary policy nabe president kevin swift said in a summary nearly three quarters of panelists believe that the federal reserve s policy is about right though the survey showed that most economists anticipate some rise in interest rates this year the markets aren t bracing for impact there is a schism between what the nabe panel and the markets think about the fed s rate path and the shrinking of its balance sheet said megan greene global chief economist at manulife asset management and chair of the nabe survey the markets are pricing in no more interest rate hikes in 2019 whereas a majority of the nabe panel expects one or two rate hikes this year a lack of resolution between the u s and china on trade is a major source of concern the survey found more than 90 percent of economists surveyed said they anticipate existing tariffs to drag the u s gdp down by 25 basis points or more almost all said they expect the tariffs to increase in inflation on sunday trump said he would delay a scheduled increase in tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports as negotiators seek a trade deal with beijing if an agreement is reached trump is expected to host chinese president xi jinping at his florida estate late next month to finalize terms fears of a greater global slowdown are growing outside the u s a survey of nearly 800 top business leaders around the world listed global recession as their biggest concern for 2019 last month the international monetary fund scaled back its global growth predictions through 2020 saying the balance of risks remains skewed to the downside and momentum is past its peak this story was first published by the washington post follow chitribbusiness on facebook and chitribbiz on twitter
this post is also available in italian by ellen brown february 21 2019 the original article may be found here quantitative easing was supposed to be an emergency measure the federal reserve eased shrinkage in the money supply due to the 2008 09 credit crisis by pumping out trillions of dollars in new bank reserves after the crisis the presumption was that the fed would normalize conditions by sopping up the excess reserves through quantitative tightening qt raising interest rates and selling the securities it had bought with new reserves back into the market the fed relentlessly pushed on with quantitative tightening through 2018 despite a severe market correction in the fall in december fed chairman jerome powell said that qt would be on autopilot meaning the fed would continue to raise interest rates and to sell 50 billion monthly in securities until it hit its target but the market protested loudly to this move with the nasdaq composite index dropping 22 from its late summer high worse defaults on consumer loans were rising december 2018 was the first time in two years that all loan types and all major metropolitan statistical areas showed a higher default rate month over month consumer debt including auto student and credit card debt is typically bundled and sold as asset backed securities similar to the risky mortgage backed securities that brought down the market in 2008 after the fed had progressively raised interest rates chairman powell evidently got the memo in january he abruptly changed course and announced that qt would be halted if needed on february 4th mary daly president of the federal reserve bank of san francisco said they were considering going much further you could imagine executing policy with your interest rate as your primary tool and the balance sheet as a secondary tool one that you would use more readily she said qe and qt would no longer be emergency measures but would be routine tools for managing the money supply in a february 13th article on seeking alpha titled quantitative easing on demand mark grant wrote if the fed does decide to pursue this strategy it will be a wholesale change in the way the financial system in the united states operates and i think that very few institutions or people appreciate what is taking place or what it will mean to the markets all of the markets the problem of debt deflation the fed is realizing that it cannot bring its balance sheet back to normal it must keep pumping new money into the banking system to avoid a recession this naturally alarms fed watchers worried about hyperinflation but qe need not create unwanted inflation if directed properly the money spigots just need to be aimed at the debtors rather than the creditor banks in fact regular injections of new money directly into the economy may be just what the economy needs to escape the boom and bust cycle that has characterized it for two centuries mark grant concluded his article by quoting abraham lincoln the government should create issue and circulate all the currency and credits needed to satisfy the spending power of the government and the buying power of consumers by the adoption of these principles the taxpayers will be saved immense sums of interest money will cease to be master and become the servant of humanity the quote is apparently apocryphal but the principle still holds new money needs to be regularly added to the money supply to avoid an overwhelming debt burden and allow the economy to reach its true productive potential regular injections of new money are necessary to avoid something economists fear even more than inflation the sort of debt deflation that took down the economy in the 1930s most money today is created by banks when they make loans when overextended borrowers pay down old loans without taking out new ones the money supply deflates or shrinks demand shrinks with it and businesses lacking customers close their doors in the sort of self feeding death spiral seen in the great depression as australian economist steve keen observes today the level of private debt is way too high and that is why so little lending is occurring but mainstream economists consider the rate of growth of debt to be irrelevant to macroeconomic policy because lending is thought to simply redistribute spending power from savers to investors conventional economic theory says that banks are merely intermediaries recirculating existing money rather than creating spending power in their own right but this is not true says prof keen banks actually create new money when they make loans he cites the bank of england which said in its 2014 quarterly report anks do not act simply as intermediaries lending out deposits that savers place with them and nor do they multiply up central bank money to create new loans and deposits in the modern economy most money takes the form of bank deposits but how those bank deposits are created is often misunderstood the principal way is through commercial banks making loans whenever a bank makes a loan it simultaneously creates a matching deposit in the borrower s bank account thereby creating new money loans create deposits and deposits make up the bulk of the money supply money today is created by banks as a debt on their balance sheets and more is always owed back than was created since the interest claimed by the banks is not created in the original loan debt thus grows faster than the money supply when overextended borrowers quit taking out the new loans needed to repay old loans the gap widens even further the result is debt deflation a debt induced reduction in the new money needed to stimulate economic activity and growth thus the need for injections of new money to fill the gap between debt and the money available to repay it however the money created through qe to date has not gone to the consuming public where it must go to fill this gap rather it has gone to the banks which have funneled it into the speculative financialized markets nomi prins calls this dark money the trillions of dollars flowing yearly in and around global stock bond and derivatives markets generated by central banks when they electronically fabricate money by buying bonds and stocks she writes these dark money flows stretch around the world according to a pattern of power influence and of course wealth for select groups she shows graphically that the rise in dark money is directly correlated with the rise in financial markets qe has worked to reverse the debts of the banks and to prop up the stock market but it has not relieved the debts of consumers businesses or governments and it is these debts that will trigger the sort of debt deflation that can take the economy down keen concludes that no amount of exhorting banks to intermediate will end the drought in credit growth that is the real cause of the great malaise the only way to reduce the private debt burden without causing a depression he says is a modern debt jubilee or people s quantitative easing qe funded debt relief in antiquity as prof michael hudson observes debts were routinely forgiven when a new ruler took the throne the rulers and their advisors knew that debt at interest grew faster than the money supply and that debt relief was necessary to avoid economic collapse from an overwhelming debt overhang economic growth is arithmetic and can t keep up with the exponential growth of debt growing at compound interest consumers need that sort of debt relief today but simply voiding out their debts as was done in antiquity will not work because the debts are not owed to the government they are owed to banks and private investors who would have to bear the loss the alternative suggested by keen and others is to fill the debt gap with a form of qe dropped not into bank reserve accounts but digitally into the bank accounts of the general public debtors could then use the money to pay down their debts in fact keen says it should go first to pay down debts non debtors would receive a cash injection properly managed these injections need not create inflation see my earlier article here money is created as loans and extinguished when they are paid off so the money used to pay down debt would be extinguished along with the debt and the cash injections not used to pay down debt would just help fill the gap between real and potential productivity allowing demand and supply to rise together keeping prices stable a regular injection of money into personal bank accounts has been called a universal basic income but better would be to call it a national dividend something all citizens are entitled to equally without regard to economic status or ability to work it would serve as a safety net for people living paycheck to paycheck but the larger purpose would be as economic policy to stimulate demand and productivity keeping the wheels of industry turning money might then indeed become

there is a new economic paradigm on the left it is called the modern monetary theory its basic premise is that we should not be concerned about the federal debt mosads the theory asserts that the federal government still has plenty of space to run up more debt debt part of the logic goes is not a problem unless interest rates start to rise since interest rates are below their historic average running up more federal debt is acceptable in fact according to the modern monetary theory we have not even begun to meet the limits of how much debt we can put on the backs of the american taxpayer and future generations it is a sky is the limit type of economic axiom this theory comes along at a convenient time for the democratic party many of the announced democratic candidates for president have set forth platforms or positions that allow them to compete for left wing votes with sen bernie sanders i vt sanders is of course a socialist those who wish to get to the left of him or merely rival him are promoting massive expansions in the size and activities of the federal government expansions that would require dramatic spending several democratic candidates and the rank and file of their party for that matter have endorsed nationalizing the healthcare delivery system using the euphemism of medicare for all this idea is projected to cost between 30 trillion and 40 trillion even if one were to introduce the 70 percent income tax rate being proposed by leaders on the left this would still involve a huge increase in deficit financing and thus the debt along with nationalized healthcare the majority of the democratic party and certainly many of those who wish to be president are calling for a green new deal the specifics of this proclamation involve among other things ending all net carbon emissions within ten years and retrofitting all buildings in america so they have no carbon footprint the cost of this idea is so staggering that it cannot be effectively calculated but it is a more than a safe bet that it would add many trillions to the national debt now along comes a group of economists who advocating for massive government spending and the resulting explosion of debt have proposed the modern monetary theory this is very convenient for sanders and others on the left a group which now appears to include the entire aristocracy of the democratic party this economic theory could best be described as the equivalent of claiming that water runs uphill the sun rises in the west and apples do not fall from trees it is the alfred e neuman platform of political posturing it takes what me worry to a new level in promoting political ideas that are fiscally dysfunctional two weeks ago the u s national debt passed 22 trillion according to the new democratic theorists this is not an issue of concern it may not even be a bad thing the suggestion is that the federal debt can should and will be increased with enthusiasm through the expansion of the role of government there are of course a few problems with this bit of snake oil economics first is the fact that debt does not grow on trees debt comes from people entities or other governments lending us money amazingly or so it seems to those on the left these creditors expect to be paid back no problem the leftists insist in the united states we print our own currency the same currency in which our debt is denominated therefore we have the flexibility to simply print more money to pay for the debt under the new democratic theory inflation is not a problem it has departed as an economic threat printing massive amounts of money to cover our debt therefore is acceptable this will be a very hard sell to those who have lent us the money in the first place and expect to get paid back in dollars worth as much as those they lent to us these folks will not one presumes be accepting of the economic sleight of hand that these new modern democratic leaders are proposing even without any new acts of massive government largesse federal deficits are projected to annually exceed 1 trillion for the foreseeable future mossecondads by the end of the next decade our debt to gdp ratio will easily top 100 percent these numbers are not good if they are compounded by anything resembling the spending proposed by democratic candidates for president we would see an astronomical increase in our national debt if all this new debt is to be justified and dismissed by cranking up the money printing presses it is inconceivable that significant inflation will not result in effect we would be talking about a massive devaluation of the dollar think greece when you contemplate the implications of these ideas or venezuela or argentina or germany in the 1930s or if you are drinking the kool aid of the new modern monetary theory and those running for president who embrace it think about how you get water to run uphill or the sun to rise in the west judd gregg r is a former governor and

president donald trump said on sunday he would delay an increase in u s tariffs on chinese goods thanks to productive trade talks and that he and chinese president xi jinping would meet to seal a deal if progress continued the announcement was the clearest sign yet that china and the united states are closing in on a deal to end a months long trade war that has slowed global growth and disrupted markets trump had planned to raise tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on 200 billion worth of chinese imports into the united states if an agreement between the world s two largest economies were not reached by friday after a week of talks that extended into the weekend trump said those tariffs would not go up for now in a tweet he said progress had been made in divisive areas including intellectual property protection technology transfers agriculture services and currency as a result he said i will be delaying the u s increase in tariffs now scheduled for march 1 assuming both sides make additional progress we will be planning a summit for president xi and myself at mar a lago to conclude an agreement a very good weekend for u s china mar a lago is the president s property in florida where the two men have met before the president did not set a new deadline for the talks to conclude but he told u s state governors gathered at the white house that there could be very big news over the next week or two if all went well in the negotiations the white house did not provide specific details on the kind of progress that had been made china s official xinhua news agency said in a commentary that the goal of an agreement was getting closer and closer but also warned that negotiations would get more difficult as they approached the final stages the emergence of new uncertainty cannot be ruled out and the long term nature complexity and difficulty of china u s trade frictions must be clearly recognized xinhua said trump and xi called a 90 day truce last year to give their advisers time to negotiate a deal the threat of tariff increases represented significant leverage for the trump team as beijing is trying to stabilize china s cooling economy we can t be sure whether this constitutes a major cave or success because we don t know the details of what has been negotiated but agreeing to extend negotiations a few more weeks definitely is in china s interests said scott kennedy a china expert at the center for strategic and international studies in washington at this point the u s has likely gotten all it s going to get out of china j p morgan asset management market strategist tai hui said the move suggested both sides wanted a settlement of the dispute and added that further tariff escalation would have added to concerns about the u s growth outlook markets which have been sensitive to the dispute as it has slowed global growth and some u s trade associations cheered trump s move u s equity index futures opened higher on sunday evening as trading kicked off for the week s p 500 e mini futures ticked higher after trump s tweets on trade suggesting wall street would open on positive footing on monday morning asian shares scaled a five month high and the australian dollar a proxy for china investments got a 0 4 percent lift from the news chinese stocks and the yuan jumped at the start of trade with the benchmark shanghai composite index up 2 1 percent its highest since aug 1 and the yuan hit its strongest level against the dollar since july trump leaves on monday for vietnam where he will hold a summit with north korean leader kim jong un the president who faces a re election battle next year has portrayed his engagement with kim and forcefulness with china as key successes of his presidency enforcement sticking point trump said on friday there was a good chance a deal would emerge but his lead trade negotiator u s trade representative robert lighthizer emphasized then that some major hurdles remained lighthizer has been a key voice in pushing china to make structural reforms china s negotiators stayed for the weekend and the two sides discussed the thorny issue of how to enforce a potential trade deal on sunday according to a person familiar with the talks tariffs and commodities were also on sunday s agenda he said negotiators have been seeking to iron out differences on changes to china s treatment of state owned enterprises subsidies forced technology transfers and cyber theft washington wants a strong enforcement mechanism to ensure that chinese reform commitments are followed through to completion while beijing has insisted on what it called a fair and objective process another source briefed on the talks said that enforcement remained a major sticking point as of saturday reuters reported on wednesday that both sides were drafting memorandums of understanding mous on cyber theft intellectual property rights services agriculture and non tariff barriers to trade including subsidies trump said he did not like mous because they are short term and he wanted a long term deal that sparked a back and forth with lighthizer who argued that mous were binding contracts before saying they would abandon the term altogether going forward the source familiar with the talks played down the apparent tension between the top trade negotiator and the president saying trump a former new york businessman had viewed mous from a real estate perspective while lighthizer had done so from a trade perspective there was no daylight between the two men the source said at the white house event with governors on sunday trump said lighthizer was doing a fantastic job

flows for an understanding of our operating results ffo adds back historical cost depreciation which assumes the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably in the future in fact real estate asset values increase or decrease with market conditions consequently we believe ffo is a useful supplemental measure in evaluating our operating performance by disregarding or adding back historical cost depreciation funds from operations is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc nareit as net income available to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses on sales of properties plus impairment of real estate assets plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be compared with our reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in our consolidated financial statements our computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions 2 net operating income or noi is a non gaap generally accepted accounting principles financial measure that we define as total continuing revenues less continuing property operating expenses noi also can be calculated by adding back to net income interest expense impairment and casualty losses depreciation and amortization expense acquisition related costs general and administrative expense and deducting from net income income from discontinued operations interest income gain on sale of real estate and equity in income of joint ventures we believe that noi is a meaningful measure to investors in evaluating our operating performance because we utilize noi in making decisions with respect to capital allocations in determining current property values and comparing period to period and market to market property operating results additionally noi is widely used in the real estate industry and the self storage industry to measure the performance and value of real estate assets without regard to various items included in net income that do not relate to or are

of its contracted natural gas transportation as energy transfer s rover project provided additional outlets to the midwest and gulf coast in september the fourth quarter of 2018 natural gas differential of 0 08 under nymex is the best fourth quarter differential range has seen since 2012 due in large part to the addition of transportation out of appalachia going forward range expects to keep its natural gas transportation full and sell incremental gas production into local markets which have improved due to the recently added takeaway infrastructure range has capacity on the mariner east 1 pipeline for a combined 40 000 barrels per day of ethane and propane as the only producer with propane capacity on mariner east 1 range has been able to capture premiums to the mont belvieu index price by exporting the majority of its propane to international markets since early 2016 in addition the company sent the majority of its normal butane and remaining propane volumes during the summer to marcus hook for export via local rail as the company continues to develop its liquids acreage additional outlets for ngl production are beneficial in providing stability to ngl price especially during the summer when in basin demand is low range has taken capacity on mariner east 2 for a combined 20 000 barrels per day of propane and butane starting in april 2020 which gives the company additional flexibility in marketing ngl production while participating in the expected local market improvements importantly range expects to fill the incremental capacity with existing propane and butane volumes leaving flexibility to sell incremental ngls in basin in january 2019 range lost access to its capacity on sunoco s mariner east 1 pipeline following the appearance of a subsidence along the pipeline route as a result of the outage range is utilizing available capacity on the recently commissioned mariner east 2 pipeline to continue moving its propane to the marcus hook terminal for ethane range has multiple options for marketing its production including the ability to sell ethane as natural gas while not materially altering corporate cash flows the delayed

inform the reader of the details of each amount and provide a summary of the realized cash settled amounts and third party transportation gathering processing and compression expense which were historically reported as natural gas ngls and oil sales this information is intended to bridge the gap between various readers understanding and fully disclose the information needed the company discloses in this release the detailed components of many of the single line items shown in the gaap financial statements included in the company s annual report on form 10 k the company believes that it is important to furnish this detail of the various components comprising each line of the statements of operations to better inform the reader of the details of each amount the changes between periods and the effect on its financial results finding and development cost per unit is a non gaap metric used in the exploration and production industry by companies investors and analysts drill bit development cost per mcfe is based on estimated and unaudited drilling development and exploration costs incurred divided by the total of reserve additions performance and price revisions these calculations do not include the future development costs required for the development of proved undeveloped reserves this reserves metric may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies the u s securities and exchange commission the sec method of computing finding costs contains additional cost components and results in a higher number a reconciliation of the two methods is shown on our website at www rangeresources com the reserve replacement ratio and finding and development cost per unit are statistical indicators that have limitations including their predictive and comparative value as an annual measure the reserve replacement ratio can be limited because it may vary widely based on the extent and timing of new discoveries and the varying effects of changes in prices and well performance in addition since the reserve replacement ratio and finding and development cost per unit do not consider the cost or timing of future production of new reserves such measures may not be an adequate measure of value creation we believe that the presentation of pv 10 is relevant and useful to our investors as supplemental disclosure to the standardized measure or after tax amount because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account future corporate income taxes and our current tax structure while the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each company pv 10 is based on prices and discount factors that are consistent for all companies because of this pv 10 can be used within the industry and by creditors and security analysts to evaluate estimated net cash flows from proved reserves on a more comparable basis range resources corporation nyse rrc is a

data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions as well as the option to disclose probable and possible reserves range has elected not to disclose its probable and possible reserves in its filings with the sec range uses certain broader terms such as resource potential unrisked resource potential unproved resource potential or upside or other descriptions of volumes of resources potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that may include probable and possible reserves as defined by the sec s guidelines range has not attempted to distinguish probable and possible reserves from these broader classifications the sec s rules prohibit us from including in filings with the sec these broader classifications of reserves these estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved probable and possible reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized unproved resource potential refers to range s internal estimates of hydrocarbon quantities that may be potentially discovered through exploratory drilling or recovered with additional drilling or recovery techniques and have not been reviewed by independent engineers unproved resource potential does not constitute reserves within the meaning of the society of petroleum engineer s petroleum resource management system and does not include proved reserves area wide unproven resource potential has not been fully risked by range s management eur or estimated ultimate recovery refers to our management s estimates of hydrocarbon quantities that may be recovered from a well completed as a producer in the area these quantities may not necessarily constitute or represent reserves within the meaning of the society of petroleum engineer s petroleum resource management system or the sec s oil and natural gas disclosure rules actual quantities that may be recovered from range s interests could differ substantially factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of range s drilling program which will be directly affected by the availability of capital drilling and production costs commodity prices availability of drilling services and equipment drilling results lease expirations transportation constraints regulatory approvals field spacing rules recoveries of gas in place length of horizontal laterals actual drilling results including geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates and other factors estimates of resource potential may change significantly as development of our resource plays provides additional data in addition our production forecasts and expectations for future periods are dependent upon many assumptions including estimates of production decline rates from existing wells and the undertaking and outcome of future drilling activity which may be affected by significant

states if an agreement between the world s two largest economies were not reached by friday after a week of talks that extended into the weekend trump said those tariffs would not go up for now in a

details on the kind of progress that had been made the chinese government s top diplomat state councillor wang yi told a forum in beijing on monday that the talks had made substantive progress providing positive expectations for the stability of bilateral ties and global economic development china s foreign ministry said advertisement advertisement china s official xinhua news agency said in a commentary that the goal of an agreement was getting closer and closer but also warned that negotiations would get more difficult as they approached the final stages the emergence of new uncertainty cannot be ruled out and the long term nature complexity and difficulty of china u s trade frictions must be clearly recognised xinhua said story continues trump and xi called a 90 day truce last year to give their advisers time to negotiate a deal the threat of tariff increases represented significant leverage for the trump team as beijing is trying to stabilize china s cooling economy we can t be sure whether this constitutes a major cave or success because we don t know the details of what has been negotiated but agreeing to extend negotiations a few more weeks definitely is in china s interests said scott kennedy a china expert at the center for strategic and international studies in washington at this point the u s has likely gotten all it s going to get out of china j p morgan asset management market strategist tai hui said the move suggested both sides wanted a settlement of the dispute and added that further tariff escalation would have added to concerns about the u s growth outlook advertisement advertisement markets which have been sensitive to the dispute as it has slowed global growth and some u s trade associations cheered trump s move u s equity index

lighthizer emphasized then that some major hurdles remained lighthizer has been a key voice in pushing china to make structural reforms china s negotiators stayed for the weekend and the two sides discussed the thorny issue of how to enforce a potential trade deal on sunday according to a person familiar with the talks tariffs and commodities were also on sunday s agenda he said advertisement advertisement negotiators have been seeking to iron out differences on changes to china s treatment of state owned enterprises subsidies forced technology transfers and cyber theft washington wants a strong enforcement mechanism to ensure that chinese reform commitments are followed through to completion while beijing has insisted on what it called a fair and objective process another source briefed on the talks said that enforcement remained a major sticking point as of saturday reuters reported on wednesday that both sides were drafting memorandums of understanding mous on cyber theft intellectual property rights services agriculture and non tariff barriers to trade including subsidies trump said he did not like mous because they are short term and he wanted a long term deal that sparked a back and forth with lighthizer who argued that mous were binding contracts before saying they would abandon the term altogether going forward advertisement advertisement the source familiar with the talks played down the apparent tension between the top trade negotiator and the president saying trump a former new york businessman had viewed mous from a real estate perspective while lighthizer had done so from a trade perspective there was no daylight between the two men the source said at the white house event with governors on sunday trump said lighthizer was doing a fantastic

of its contracted natural gas transportation as energy transfer s rover project provided additional outlets to the midwest and gulf coast in september the fourth quarter of 2018 natural gas differential of 0 08 under nymex is the best fourth quarter differential range has seen since 2012 due in large part to the addition of transportation out of appalachia going forward range expects to keep its natural gas transportation full and sell incremental gas production into local markets which have improved due to the recently added takeaway infrastructure range has capacity on the mariner east 1 pipeline for a combined 40 000 barrels per day of ethane and propane as the only producer with propane capacity on mariner east 1 range has been able to capture premiums to the mont belvieu index price by exporting the majority of its propane to international markets since early 2016 in addition the company sent the majority of its normal butane and remaining propane volumes during the summer to marcus hook for export via local rail as the company continues to develop its liquids acreage additional outlets for ngl production are beneficial in providing stability to ngl price especially during the summer when in basin demand is low range has taken capacity on mariner east 2 for a combined 20 000 barrels per day of propane and butane starting in april 2020 which gives the company additional flexibility in marketing ngl production while participating in the expected local market improvements importantly range expects to fill the incremental capacity with existing propane and butane volumes leaving flexibility to sell incremental ngls in basin in january 2019 range lost access to its capacity on sunoco s mariner east 1 pipeline following the appearance of a subsidence along the pipeline route as a result of the outage range is utilizing available capacity on the recently commissioned mariner east 2 pipeline to continue moving its propane to the marcus hook terminal for ethane range has multiple options for marketing its production including the ability to sell ethane as natural gas while not materially altering corporate cash flows the delayed restart of markwest plants and the mariner east outage have reduced production volumes and as a result range s first quarter guidance of 2 225 mmcfe per day reflects the estimated production impact

of the call may be accessed at www rangeresources com the webcast will be archived for replay on the company s website until march 26 non gaap financial measures adjusted net income comparable to analysts estimates as set forth in this release represents income or loss from operations before income taxes adjusted for certain non cash items detailed in the accompanying table less income taxes we believe adjusted net income comparable to analysts estimates is calculated on the same basis as analysts estimates and that many investors use this published research in making investment decisions and evaluating operational trends of the company and its performance relative to other oil and gas producing companies diluted earnings per share adjusted as set forth in this release represents adjusted net income comparable to analysts estimates on a diluted per share basis a table is included which reconciles income or loss from operations to adjusted net income comparable to analysts estimates and diluted earnings per share adjusted on its website the company provides additional comparative information on prior periods along with non gaap revenue disclosures cash flow from operations before changes in working capital sometimes referred to as adjusted cash flow as defined in this release represents net cash provided by operations before changes in working capital and exploration expense adjusted for certain non cash compensation items cash flow from operations before changes in working capital is widely accepted by the investment community as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company s ability to generate cash to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt cash flow from operations before changes in working capital is also useful because it is widely used by professional research analysts in valuing comparing rating and providing investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry in turn many investors use this published research in making investment decisions cash flow from operations before changes in working capital is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows or as a measure of liquidity a table is included which reconciles net cash provided by operations to cash flow from operations before changes in working capital as used in this release on its website the company provides additional comparative information on prior periods for cash flow cash margins and non gaap earnings as used in this release the cash prices realized for oil and natural gas production including the amounts realized on cash settled derivatives and net of transportation gathering processing and compression expense is a critical component in the company s performance tracked by investors and professional research analysts in valuing comparing rating and providing investment recommendations and forecasts of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry in turn many investors use this published research in making investment decisions due to the gaap disclosures of various derivative transactions and third party transportation gathering processing and compression expense such information is now reported in various lines of the income statement the company believes that it is important to furnish a table reflecting the details of the various components of each income statement line to better inform the reader of the details of each amount and provide a summary of the realized cash settled amounts and third party transportation gathering processing and compression expense which were historically reported as natural gas ngls and oil sales this information is intended to bridge the gap between various readers understanding and fully disclose the information needed the company discloses in this release the detailed components of many of the single line items shown in the gaap financial statements included in the company s annual report on form 10 k the company believes that it is important to furnish this detail of the various components comprising each line of the statements of operations to better inform the reader of the details of each amount the changes between periods and the effect on its financial results finding and development cost per unit is a non gaap metric used in the exploration and production industry by companies investors and analysts drill bit development cost per mcfe is based on estimated and unaudited drilling development and exploration costs incurred divided by the total of reserve additions performance and price revisions these calculations do not include the future development costs required for the development of proved undeveloped reserves this reserves metric may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies the u s securities and exchange commission the sec method of computing finding costs contains additional cost components and results in a higher number a reconciliation of the two methods is shown on our website at www rangeresources com the reserve replacement ratio and finding and development cost per unit are statistical indicators that have limitations including their predictive and comparative value as an annual measure the reserve replacement ratio can be limited because it may vary widely based on the extent and timing of new discoveries and the varying effects of changes in prices and well performance in addition since the reserve replacement ratio and finding and development cost per unit do not consider the cost or timing of future production of new reserves such measures may not be an adequate measure of value creation we believe that the presentation of pv 10 is relevant and useful to our investors as supplemental disclosure to the standardized measure or after tax amount because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account future corporate income taxes and our current tax structure while the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each company pv 10 is based on prices and discount factors that are consistent for all companies because of this pv 10 can be used within the industry and by creditors and security analysts to evaluate estimated net cash flows from proved reserves on a more comparable basis range resources corporation nyse rrc is a

data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions as well as the option to disclose probable and possible reserves range has elected not to disclose its probable and possible reserves in its filings with the sec range uses certain broader terms such as resource potential unrisked resource potential unproved resource potential or upside or other descriptions of volumes of resources potentially recoverable through additional drilling or recovery techniques that may include probable and possible reserves as defined by the sec s guidelines range has not attempted to distinguish probable and possible reserves from these broader classifications the sec s rules prohibit us from including in filings with the sec these broader classifications of reserves these estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved probable and possible reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of actually being realized unproved resource potential refers to range s internal estimates of hydrocarbon quantities that may be potentially discovered through exploratory drilling or recovered with additional drilling or recovery techniques and have not been reviewed by independent engineers unproved resource potential does not constitute reserves within the meaning of the society of petroleum engineer s petroleum resource management system and does not include proved reserves area wide unproven resource potential has not been fully risked by range s management eur or estimated ultimate recovery refers to our management s estimates of hydrocarbon quantities that may be recovered from a well completed as a producer in the area these quantities may not necessarily constitute or represent reserves within the meaning of the society of petroleum engineer s petroleum resource management system or the sec s oil and natural gas disclosure rules actual quantities that may be recovered from range s interests could differ substantially factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of range s drilling program which will be directly affected by the availability of capital drilling and production costs commodity prices availability of drilling services and equipment drilling results lease expirations transportation constraints regulatory approvals field spacing rules recoveries of gas in place length of horizontal laterals actual drilling results including geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates and other factors estimates of resource potential may change significantly as development of our resource plays provides additional data in addition our production forecasts and expectations for future periods are
