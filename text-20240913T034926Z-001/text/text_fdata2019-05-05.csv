will yuan replace us dollar and make gold shine the us dollar will collapse or it will be replaced by another currency we hear such statements all the time are they true we decided to check these claims so we invite you to read our today s article about the us dollar s international supremacy and find out whether the greenback s demise is likely in the foreseeable future let s also draw implications from the analysis for the precious metals market we have heard about the fall of the us dollar s significance for over half a century in particular the rise of china s economy threatens the greenback s dominance trump s unsound fiscal policy and the recent powell s dovish turn only reinforce these fears so let s analyze whether such a scenario is likely in the foreseeable future and let s draw implications for the precious metals market the dollar s supremacy started around 1955 when reserves held in greenback exceeded those held in pound sterling since then the us dollar is a king to be clear we do not maintain that greenback is a wonderful currency without problems and better than gold no it simply has no competitors among other fiat currencies it is a king of beggars initially after the gradual demise of british currency the only possible alternatives to the greenback were the japanese yen and the deutsche mark as japan and germany noted impressive pace of economic development however both economies were much smaller and with less liquid financial market moreover the us army stationed in both countries which cast a shadow over their currencies the situation has not improved since then in the 1990s germany struggled with the reunification while japan fell into multi year stagnation after the burst of the enormous asset price bubble actually one may convincingly claim that japan has not fully recovered yet as the country still faces deflation weak banks adverse demographics sluggish growth or even periodic bouts of negative growth and negative interest rates indeed the bank of japan is running the most accommodative machine of any central bank that it systematically important hence yen is not likely candidate to replace the us dollar many analysts believed that 21th century will bring some changes as the ecb launched euro a new common currency for several european countries however for almost every economist with some knowledge about the international monetary system it was clear that a project based on a unified monetary policy and heterogeneous fiscal policy each member of the eurozone conducts its own policy could not pose a serious threat to the us dollar the euro is too fragile which was revealed by the great recession and the sovereign debt crisis the current italy s problems are just an old shortcomings in a new disguise i write more about the latest twenty years of the eurozone in the february edition of the market overview last but not least germany is also an obstacle for euro to gain in importance you see berlin favors the policy of a balanced budget for us it is a very sound policy but it results in the small supply of german bunds so investors prefer to park their funds in the us treasury market which is the most liquid market in the world if not euro and not yen so maybe yuan will dethrone the us dollar this is what many analysts expect based on china s economic potential after all the imf included the chinese renminbi into the sdr basket in october 2016 however the yuan is not likely to replace the us dollar anytime soon the main reason is shallow financial market in china it still lacks transparency and it is controlled to large extent by the authorities do you remember august 2015 when the people s bank of china devalued the currency i bet you do let s look at the chart below the share of the yuan in global currency reserves amounted to 1 8 percent in q3 2018 it does not look like a great threat for us dollar does it chart 1 composition of world s total foreign currency reserves from q1 2010 to q3 2018 green line us dollar blue line euro purple line pound sterling orange line japanese yen red line chinese yuan investors should remember that there are four things needed in order for a currency to play a global role size stability liquidity and security although china s economy and trade payments are big the yuan is not stable not liquid and not secure the financial system is still heavily controlled by the authorities and it is not open and transparent although the share of the us dollar in the world s total foreign reserves has declined somewhat since 2015 it remained dominant with share above 60 percent the euro which is the second most popular reserve currency has share amounting to 20 percent or one third of the greenback s share moreover although dollar s role as official reserve diminished slightly its share in bank external claims has risen similarly volumes through u s based dollar wire transfer and settlement systems have also continued to rise to sum up tina says that the us dollar will remain the world s global reserve despite all its shortcomings who is tina it is the slogan used by margaret thatcher there is no alternative yen let s be serious japan still cannot stand on its own feet after post bubble recession approaching the third lost decade euro no way as long as there are doubts about the eurozone s survival yuan maybe someday but not anytime soon as the renminbi is not freely floating while china s capital markets are not yet fully open the implications for the precious metals market are clear the gold bulls should not count on yuan replacing the us dollar it is not going to happen anytime soon you may not like america and its currency but the fact is the greenback will remain the dominant fiat currency us dollar will remain relatively strong which will be a headwind for the yellow metal however when china liberalizes and opens its capital market the gradual reshuffle in the composition of the foreign reserves may occur which could support gold thank you if you enjoyed the above analysis and would you like to know more about the link between the u s economy and the gold market we

indexing and passive investment have little to learn from macro at the start of april the bloomberg barclay bond index included mainland chinese bonds for the first time a macro strategist could have explained how china s 10 year yield had been falling since reaching above 4 in may june 2018 was near 3 40 in late march and why it might not go down much further the government was committed to supporting the economy new stimulus was being delivered and more were in the pipeline the yuan had appreciated by nearly 2 5 in q1 it was the third strongest currency behind the russian rouble 6 2 and thai baht 2 6 the dollar had approached a level cny6 70 where chinese officials had seemed to draw a line signals are indirect and can change not only were yields low but the currency was strong it was not an attractive time to be adding mainland bonds to the portfolio still the index is the index if one second guesses the index that makes it a different kind of fund actively managed funds cost more than passive funds though fixed income managers are more likely to beat their benchmark than equity managers in a more immediate sense macro does not seem to matter either the us reported growth accelerated q1 to above three percent blowing away expectations and the dollar meh the us reported a jobs beat a week later and a drop in the unemployment rate and again meh the eurozone reported better stronger than expected growth with italy emerging from the h2 18 recession it followed it up with a larger than expected rise in cpi the euro did not get any traction was near the lows for the week prior to the us jobs report but let s not jettison macro too quickly equity analysts often talk about the market as a discounting mechanism to say that same thing slightly differently markets anticipate there was net demand for dollars ahead of the gdp report there was demand for dollars before the employment report it is as if the smart money bought the dollar effect before the cause strong economic data it is as if some of those who bought ahead of the news were happy to sell to those who thought the headlines justified a stronger dollar we suspect that divergence that has been the primary fuel of the dollar s rally has run its course for now us growth is not quite as strong as it may look and the eurozone is not as weak the risk is on the upside for the european service and composite pmi even in germany where the manufacturing sector is still contracting the flash service pmi was a five month high the uk is likely to report that growth accelerated to 0 5 in q1 from 0 2 in q4 18 which would lift the year over year rate to 1 8 from 1 4 japan is the laggard it will not report q1 gdp until the middle of the month but it looks like it contracted household spending in march is expected to have slowed on a year over year basis for the second month here is part of the problem cash earnings are a falling year over year and march is likely to be the third consecutive decline since deflation has been arrested the reserve banks of australia and new zealand meet the rbnz is more likely to cut rates that the rba the market has a little more than half the cut discounted the new zealand dollar has fallen a little more than 5 since late march it came within a few hundredths of a penny from the flash crash low 0 6575 on january 3 along with other currencies it staged an upside reversal ahead of the weekend it was mostly a question of the broader us dollar pullback but the market may be looking past the first cut if it is one and done there would be scope for the kiwi to trade higher the market appears to have discounted a little more than a 1 in 3 chance of second rate cut this year in this context what the rbnz says may be more important than what it does some will argue that the case for an rba rate cut is just as compelling but the market thinks otherwise the derivatives suggest around a 37 chance of a cut has been priced however speculators in the futures market have net short australian dollar futures position 54k vs 11 5k yet the aussie had fallen about 3 1 since april 17 when it tested a two month high a little above 0 7200 it made a marginal new low since the flash crash in the knee jerk reaction to the jobs data 0 6985 before recovering to almost 0 7025 and closing again on above 0 7000 the previous floor as china returns from an extended may day holiday there will be several economic reports including international reserves might increase a little and trade slower growth in exports and a smaller contraction in imports may result in a wider surplus consumer price pressures probably edged a little higher to 2 5 matching its highest level since the first quarter last year the deflationary scare in producer prices has subsided it might rise it 0 6 which would be the strongest this year the takeaway is that what appeared to have been a slowing of the chinese economy has been arrested brexit is about to enter a new phase the local elections results were stark of 8400 council seats the tories loss almost 1335 considerably worse than expected labour cannot capitalize on the tory self immolation it lost 82 seats the lib dems were the big winner picking up 703 seats and the greens who are also pro europe gained 194 seats independents also did well the key to what happens next is the lesson that is taken from these results talks between the government and labour resume next week there is a small window of opportunity to strike a deal which would probably entail a softer exit than the kind envisioned by the likes of boris johnson or nigel farage talk suggests if a deal can be made it will be known by the end of next week if a deal cannot be worked out shortly the pressure on may to step down will build she led the party into losing its majority in the house of commons the withdrawal agreement her government negotiated for 18 months did what little else has done it united parliament delivering historic defeats to her bill not one twice but three times sterling s impressive pre weekend rally was more than a reflection of the dollar s pullback it approached its best level in two years against the euro and is supported by a 15 bp increase in the implied yield of the december short sterling futures contract speculators in the currency futures have seen a nearly two thirds increase in gross long positions since late march meanwhile the premium for three month sterling puts over calls has shrunk to its smallest level since last june the federal reserve cut the interest rate it pays on reserves because not capping the effective average fed funds rate it has tried this strategy twice in h2 18 with little success the immediate impact was inauspicious the interest on reserves now stands at 2 35 while was 2 41 the day after the fomc meeting the secured overnight funding rate that may eventually replace libor finished last week at 2 50 the top of the fed funds target range powell said that the soft inflation was transitory this might not be as controversial as some made it seem april cpi will be reported at the end of next week recall that the year over year pace was nearly halved from last june and july s 2 9 to 1 5 in february a 0 4 increase that is the median forecast in the bloomberg survey would lift the year over year back above 2 0 for the first time since last november it may not sound like much but a 0 1 rise in the core rate would be the first increase this year the mueller report was only one front on which president trump is being stymied moore is his fourth candidate to the federal reserve that was not defeated by democrats but by republicans a party that continues to support trump by an overwhelming majority the republicans are also threatening to reject trump s 2 trillion infrastructure initiative that is the subject of talks with the democrats north korea reportedly tested several short range missiles for the first time in two years the steel and aluminum tariffs are threatening to sabotage the new north american free trade agreement the march trade balance due may 9 could impact revisions to q1 gdp but they will be a reminder that despite because of the administration s economic nationalism the trade balance has deteriorated by nearly 20 over the past two years the 12 month moving average has been above 51 bln a month for the past five months the quarterly refunding takes place next week it is a reminder of the cost of last year s stimulus the treasury will auction 84 bln of coupons that same as in q1 it will raise almost 29 bln of new cash recall that treasury is taking extraordinary but not unprecedented measures in lieu of the debt ceiling being lifted these measures are limited and it appears crunch time could be by the end of q3 china s trade negotiating team will be in washington in the coming days there have been some reports that president xi s calendar is making space for a meeting with trump next month which suggests an agreement is near leaks from china are rare raising the possibility that it was purposeful at the same time there is talk that an announcement of a meeting could take place by the end of the week ahead recent accounts indicate that the us has softened its position on intellectual property rights in biologics and in cyber espionage a deal is an executive agreement which means that unlike nafta 2 0 it will not require senate approval the same holds for the current talks with europe and japan
published monday 6 may 2019 print disqus we have a problem no solutions friends don t let friends buy and hold dallas sic and conversations my recent letters described what i think the future will look like i hasten to add it isn t what i think the future should look like or what i want to see almost the entire developed world has painted itself into a corner it won t necessarily be terrible i don t expect another great depression or economic upheaval but we will have to adapt our portfolios and lifestyles to this new reality the good news is the changes will happen relatively slowly we have time to adapt in war movies it s common for the dashing leader to make bold promises like we will never retreat ahead of a glorious victory the assumption is that retreat is bad but real life military strategists say retreat can be the right move when the odds are against you better to save your ammunition for another time better yet adopt a new strategy that gives you a better chance my last few letters may look like retreat but i m just recognizing reality there is no plausible path to stopping the world s debt overload much less paying it off without a serious and painful purge if you know of such a path please share it with me but i haven t seen one so i foresee a tough decade ahead summing up entitlement spending interest on the debt defense spending and so forth will continue to produce trillion dollar plus deficits no constituency is arguing to reform the entitlement system by reducing benefits by the middle of the next decade deficits will be in the 1 5 trillion range even under the cbo s optimistic assumptions while the numbers look marginally different elsewhere the developed countries are all going the same direction toward higher deficits following the next recession and there is always one coming the us deficit will be well north of 2 trillion and the total debt will quickly rise to 30 trillion it will almost certainly be in the 40 trillion range before 2030 unless interest rates drop significantly simply paying the interest will consume much of the tax revenue fortunately i expect interest rates to drop significantly think japan a growing body of academic literature and real world experience suggests there is a point beyond which debt becomes a drag on growth that means that the recovery after the next recession will be even slower than the last one if as i expect the federal reserve and other central banks react with massive quantitative easing it is entirely possible that the whole developed world will begin to look like japan slow nominal gdp growth low interest rates that penalize savers low inflation or even deflation etc in such an environment normal equity index funds won t produce the returns many have grown to expect public pension funds will get hammered in the bear market and many will have difficulty meeting their obligations governments will be forced to either cut benefits raise taxes or both that is not going to make for a happy citizenry it will play out in different manners all across the world but the resulting frustration will be the same and to put it very bluntly frustration is inadequate to describe the result of underfunded pensions retirees made plans for their futures based upon receiving those pensions and taxpayers likewise make plans all of this will have significant investment implications which we will visit below and in great detail in the coming weeks and months but japanification to use a word is going to make income and wealth inequality worse not better this all being the case the priority now isn t whether to retreat in the sense of changing your investment strategies but how and to where so you can pick up the fight later developing a strategy requires us to understand exactly what is happening and why so i m looking at the situation from different angles we have a problem you have likely heard of income inequality that wealthy people are making a larger share of our collective income in one sense it s nothing new of course the people with the highest incomes have more of the total math guarantees it but it is true that the top s share has grown in recent decades as has the share of assets owned by the wealthiest ray dalio of bridgewater associates has been writing about this for a few years now here s a chart and quote from his latest article as shown below the income gap is about as high as ever and the wealth gap is the highest since the late 1930s today the wealth of the top 1 of the population is more than that of the bottom 90 of the population combined which is the same sort of wealth gap that existed during the 1935 40 period a period that brought in an era of great internal and external conflicts for most countries those in the top 40 now have on average more than 10 times as much wealth as those in the bottom 60 that is up from six times in 1980 source ray dalio dalio thinks it is significant that inequality at least by these measures is now in the same area it was in the great depression it plunged in the postwar years and began rising again in the 1980s i suspect if we had data going back a few centuries we would see that those 30 or so years between 1950 and 1980 were actually the statistical aberration mass prosperity hasn t been the historic norm it certainly wasn t that in the 1800s and the gilded age nor was it so in europe some people see this inequality as somehow unfair i think it is more complex than that it depends on how those with wealth became so there s a big difference between a despots who use political authority to enrich themselves and their friends b monopolists who thrive by taking choice away from consumers instead of adding to it and c entrepreneurs who grow wealthy by selling useful products to willing consumers incidentally dalio does a good job describing the problem but i think he lays the blame at the wrong doorstep his proposed solutions leave a lot to be desired i will discuss this at length in a forthcoming letter the problems begin when people perceive the wealthy are getting rich at the expense of others and it s hard to escape that conclusion when the data say the top tier is keeping a bigger share of the pie even if the pie is growing especially when your piece of the pie is not growing nearly as fast as those of the top the relative distance becomes even more stark let s review some charts from my friend bruce mehlman s latest fascinating slide deck he has much more that you can and definitely should view here source bruce mehlman if you take gdp as a proxy for national income it s been growing far faster than median family income even adjusted for inflation the wider that gap gets the more people feel like they are being left behind here s another one comparing stock market growth with family net worth this isn t really surprising since we know the top quintile owns most of the stocks the lower 80 see little direct benefit but the magnitude of the disparity is still remarkable source bruce mehlman one reason income may be unequal is that talent is increasingly unequal too or at least the willingness of businesses to buy talent here s a chart showing the most valuable companies have been getting that way with a smaller headcount source bruce mehlman mehlman cites technology as the explanation for this and i agree that s a significant part of it but so are other things like the increasing number of sectors where a small number of companies whose existence is enabled by financial engineering and monetary policy dominate their respective markets my good friend ben hunt of epsilon theory notes that the s p 500 companies have the highest earnings relative to sales in history source ben hunt quoting ben this is a 30 year chart of total s p 500 earnings divided by total s p 500 sales it s how many pennies of earnings s p 500 companies get from a dollar of sales earnings margin essentially at a high level of aggregation so at the lows of 1991 1 in sales generated a bit more than 0 03 in earnings for the s p 500 today in 2019 we are at an all time high of a bit more than 0 11 in earnings from 1 in sales it s a marvelously steady progression up and to the right temporarily marred by a recession here and there but really quite awe inspiring in its consistency yay capitalism ben goes on to say many people think that is because of technology he argues it is the financialization of our economy and the fed s loose policies i agree 100 if you think they haven t changed the rules since the 1980s and 1990s you aren t paying attention boys and girls work saving technology isn t bad in the past it freed our bodies from dangerous exhausting toil and now it s freeing our minds from mental drudgery we can adjust the problem is that it is hitting us so fast farming went from manual labor to automation over several generations now we re traveling an equal distance in only a few years resulting in millions of unemployed humans as unhappy as all this is making people now imagine how it will be when recession hits and then couple that with an ever increasing explosion of new technologies that reduce demand for many types of labor like automated driving no solutions some degree of unhappiness and discontent is part of the human condition it s what drives us to improve our lives we accept challenges as long as we think we have a fair chance at overcoming them many americans no longer believe they have that chance that s partly because they have higher expectations possibly too high but right or wrong the perception is there it affects behavior and more to the point it affects what people expect from the government when they perceive less ability to reach the next level on their own they look to washington for help i noted last week that almost no one really wants to cut government spending even the so called fiscal conservatives mostly nibble around the edges reducing budget growth here and there bill clinton was wrong when he said the era of big government is over in 1996 it s bigger than ever and growing faster than ever whether you like it or not that is a fact government revenue is not growing faster than ever which means rising debt even in today s relative prosperity again whether you like this or not is irrelevant it s happening i see no way out raising taxes on the wealthy won t get us even close to a balanced budget even at confiscatory levels raising taxes on the middle class won t happen in a recession the only tax system with a shot at actually paying for current spending even without adding the new programs some democrats want is a vat or value added tax and it is anathema in both parties no matter how i look at this i keep coming back to gigantic deficits that the federal reserve will have to monetize in some fashion probably something like the previous qe rounds but on a vastly larger scale and thus my belief it will launch an era of japan like deflation and economic doldrums if you think this is impossible or i m being too pessimistic please please tell me why i m wrong show me where we can get the necessary tax revenue without severely impacting the economy show me how we can cut benefits without getting massive pushback from politicians and please show me how we get off the path we are on and tell me what scenario you think is more plausible i don t see one i really don t friends don t let friends buy and hold you probably read my letters because they help inform your investing strategy if so then let me say this loud and clear your strategy probably needs to change the methods that worked well recently won t cut it in the new era i think we will enter soon at the risk of repeating myself for the 20th time bear markets like last december that are not accompanied by recessions have v shaped recoveries bear markets that happen in the context of a recession have long recoveries the next one because of the massive debt that will be increasing at an astounding rate is likely to see an even slower recovery friends don t let friends buy and hold at a minimum you need some type of hedging program on your equity portfolios using a simple 200 day moving average to signal the time for going to cash while not the best will help protect you from the worst of a massive bear market the recent flurry of ipo filings by unicorn companies like wework ought to be ringing alarm bells the venture capital investors who financed these businesses thus far are ready to exit they re doing so because they think the risk reward equation is as favorable as it will ever be possibly they re wrong but i don t think so we have reached the distribution stage when insiders and professional investors become net sellers while the small investors who missed most of the bull market finally jump in history says it won t end well for the latter group as the economy weakens into recession and public markets retreat i think we ll see two strategic trends first active management will return to prominence as investors realize prices can move in both directions the rias mutual funds managers and hedge funds that have managed to hold on through the lean years and many didn t will draw assets once again that doesn t mean they will succeed performance wise but they ll get a chance to try second and possibly more important the best opportunities will leave the public markets entirely we already see this unfolding as the number of listed companies declines mainly at the expense of small caps there is just no reason for most successful companies to accept the hassles and expense of an exchange listing they can raise all the capital they need from that small number of investors in whom most of the wealth is now concentrated this will unfortunately aggravate the inequality frustrations our regulatory structure keeps most private investments off limits to the average investor or even above average net worth investors so even if you manage to accumulate some capital you may not have the much better options for investing it than those with a few million dollars and more the government has rigged the markets against small investors in the name of protecting them that doesn t mean investment success will be impossible you ll have opportunities but you may have to hunt for them and act quickly when you find them that s what active managers do and not just in stocks and bonds i foresee many opportunities in real estate as well there are going to be amazing opportunities in new technologies like smart generals sometimes we have to retreat from the unwinnable battle and develop a different plan that s what i am doing we ll go deeper into this subject at my conference in dallas which is now less than two weeks away i can t wait you can hear and or see most of it with a virtual pass i truly don t know of a better educational opportunity for investors than either directly attending the strategic investment conference or getting your virtual pass please note that for people like me who prefer to learn by reading and not listening all of the speeches will be transcribed for the virtual pass and attendees automatically get them the conference is may 13 16 and there are usually a few spots that open from people having to cancel at the last minute if you can make it you probably should i look forward to seeing you there dallas sic and conversations shane and i will head for dallas next wednesday taking care of some local business and meeting friends and hopefully getting to watch the new avengers movie and then turn our complete focus to the conference surprisingly my travel calendar after that is fairly sparse for the early summer with a few potential spots here and there i was in washington dc this week where i did a video interview with my friend neil howe we discussed a wide variety of subjects including what the last half of the fourth turning will look like he foresees a great deal of political angst there is the real potential for the same kind of political stresses that gave us franklin roosevelt almost 90 years ago for some of you that is a scary thought and others will say about time i then had the privilege of spending some time with good friend newt gingrich and some of his staff we drove to a bookstore in virginia for a book signing and then he took two of us to a hole in the wall italian restaurant near his home he quizzed me for some time on my view of the economy and its interplay with society and in return i got to ask a few questions as well newt has some of the best stories as does neil howe i have been with them together and it is a priceless moment just for the record i also met with those of a different political and economic philosophy i do so all the time one of the greatest investment risks is a lack of imagination in that we can t imagine what could actually go wrong with our main investment thesis as mark twain supposedly said it ain t what you don t know that gets you into trouble it s what you know for sure that just ain t so michael lewis s book the big short opens with this similar quote from leo tolstoy the most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already without a shadow of a doubt what is laid before him i spend a great deal of time trying to determine if what i already know for a fact is actually the case that is especially true when i m developing a new thesis that makes me uncomfortable but if the facts change what else can we do but evolve with them and on that note let me wish you a great week find a friend or two and swap a few stories it will make your life better your trying to see the way forward analyst john mauldin chairman mauldin economics p s want even more great analysis from my

these policy responses have helped reverse the tightening of financial conditions to varying degrees across countries emerging markets have experienced some resumption in portfolio flows a decline in sovereign borrowing costs and a strengthening of their currencies relative to the us dollar while the improvement in financial markets has been rapid those in the real economy have been slow to

for generations younger americans found communists just as scary as count dracula the wicked witch of the west and darth vader socialism so strongly associated with marx and lenin never caught on in the united states to modern millennials however fear of socialism seems as ancient as a rotary phone in march 2019 axios released results from a harris poll showing that about half of millennial and generation z respondents believed that our economy should be mostly socialist that result is no outlier but rather a consistent finding over recent years in 2018 gallup found that 51 percent of 18 to 29 year old americans view socialism favorably only 45 percent look at capitalism positively an august 2018 yougov poll revealed that only 30 percent of 18 to 29 year olds had good feelings toward capitalism while 35 percent regarded socialism positively bernie sanders an avowed democratic socialist nearly captured the democratic presidential nomination in 2016 thanks in part to youth support another democratic socialist newly elected house member alexandria ocasio cortez from new york herself a millennial has achieved overnight celebrity accumulating more than 3 million twitter followers while trumpeting a 70 percent marginal tax rate just 25 years after the collapse of the soviet union how can socialism have made such a comeback the likeliest answer the great recession left millennials looking for alternatives to capitalism without the cold war ideological guideposts that positioned older generations both the right and the left have redefined socialism moreover so that many young supporters now think that it just means a cuddlier more equitable government yet even if socialism has been redefined its rising approval among the young is still a problem for proponents of economic liberty for decades apostles of free markets could condemn bad economic ideas merely by branding them socialist because real world marxists did such a good job of showing how much evil could radiate from a state controlled economy but those negative examples are mostly vanquished now the task ahead is to convince today s young people that society requires liberty as well as compassion the private ingenuity that generates new products and new jobs needs both incentives and reasonable regulation if our current politics tell us anything it is that this case must be made again with arguments that resonate among americans who ve probably never heard of lavrentiy beria in 2009 fox news host sean hannity mocked the obama administration s vast stimulus bill as the european socialist act of 2009 hannity joined a long line of conservative critics who ve hurled the term socialism at liberal opponents seeking to discredit their plans to expand government hannity s tag didn t derail the stimulus of course and a week later a newsweek cover story blared we are all socialists now heralding a new era of government intervention in the economy that headline to jon meacham s nearly decade old story is even truer today as those recent poll numbers of younger americans suggest the trend line is striking gallup polling data show that the share of democrats holding a positive view of socialism increased from 53 percent in 2010 to 57 percent in 2018 while the share who held a positive view of capitalism fell from 53 percent to 47 percent the shift is particularly dramatic among the young in 2010 according to gallup 68 percent of 18 to 29 year old americans felt favorably toward capitalism 51 percent felt favorably toward socialism eight years later only 45 percent of that age group view capitalism positively while 51 percent still liked socialism yougov polling found even starker figures with just 39 percent of 18 to 29 year olds viewing capitalism favorably in 2015 by 2018 that figure had fallen to 30 percent the comparable numbers for those over 65 59 percent and 56 percent the figures differ from poll to poll but the direction is clear for millennials socialism is a viable option socialism s comeback has been helped along by a change in meaning merriam webster defines socialism as any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods pretty much the traditional meaning of the term the 1912 election was the high water mark for american socialism in this sense with socialist party presidential candidate eugene debs winning 6 percent of the popular vote that year the party s platform called for collective ownership and democratic management of railroads wire and wireless telegraphs express service steamboat lines and all other social means of transportation and communication and of all large scale industries as well as the banking and currency system and land too wherever practicable in a 1949 gallup poll 46 percent of americans with an opinion on socialism thought that it meant government ownership or control of business in 2018 by contrast gallup found that only 22 percent of respondents understood socialism to mean government control thirty percent thought socialism meant equality and another 13 percent equated it with benefits and services like free medicine three times as many democratic and democratic leaning respondents thought socialism meant either equality or free benefits and services than thought it meant government control if socialism is just about higher tax rates and more generous health care then perhaps the cause of freedom doesn t have much to fear few of the new socialists seem to want industries nationalized outright ocasio cortez s preferred marginal tax rates are lower than those that president dwight eisenhower a republican found acceptable yet i m not so sanguine about the popularity of socialism even if the word has lost its harder edge if today s self proclaimed socialists merely want to champion postwar democratic ideals why adopt an ism that many older americans still regard with alarm and while total nationalization of industries is hard to imagine many ideas gaining currency with left of center politicians would significantly extend state control over private companies elizabeth warren doesn t call herself a socialist but her accountable capitalism act expects all large firms to obtain a new federal charter obligating them to pay heed to the interests of corporate stakeholders from employees to surrounding communities who could know whether a company was adequately considering such dispersed interests presumably a warren administration would make that determination this may not be socialism in the strict sense but it s heading in that direction writing in the new york times last august corey robin a political scientist at brooklyn college attempted to sum up the worldview of the new socialists the socialist argument against capitalism isn t that it makes us poor it s that it makes us unfree when my well being depends upon your whim when the basic needs of life compel submission to the market and subjugation at work we live not in freedom but in domination socialists want to end that domination to establish freedom from rule by the boss from the need to smile for the sake of a sale from the obligation to sell for the sake of survival this characterization does not suggest a slightly more generous medicaid program or higher capital gains taxes it represents a wholesale rejection of the market and its purported cruelties the increasing popularity of socialism however defined among the young has many plausible causes the trend might just be the latest example of the old line often mistakenly attributed to winston churchill if you re not a liberal when you re 25 you have no heart if you re not a conservative by the time you re 35 you have no brain the idealism of the young is timeless even a bit charming at least when it doesn t lead to the guillotine or the gulag but opinion polling from the 1960s and 1970s shows no equivalent fondness for socialism among twentysomethings perhaps it s all about the indoctrination of the young by left wing professors a 2007 study found that more than 60 percent of college teachers identified themselves as being somewhat liberal and under 20 percent as somewhat conservative a more recent study suggests an even greater leftward skew in certain disciplines among historians there were 33 5 registered democrats to every registered republican the ratio was 20 to one among journalism professors and 17 4 to one among psychology professors but left leaning views have long been prevalent on college campuses so it s unclear why indoctrination would suddenly generate a far more socialist generation even if the leftward tilt is undeniable moreover it doesn t prove that professors have been trying to convert students i tend to believe that most teachers like myself try to keep their politics out of the classroom moreover most teachers again like me lack any skill in the black arts of political propaganda and while i share the concern that america s campuses might be too ideologically monolithic i m skeptical that professors have much power to shape opinion many americans don t even go to college and many who do go aren t paying much attention to their teachers those paying attention are the least likely to be ideologically indoctrinated in 2018 gallup found that only 22 percent of respondents understood socialism to mean government control a strong left wing bias among high school teachers might be a more credible explanation since their influence comes earlier and is more widespread but high school teachers are far more balanced politically than college professors one recent education week survey of k 12 educators found 23 percent identifying as conservatives 24 percent as liberals and 43 percent as moderates fifty percent of the responding teachers voted for hillary clinton in the 2016 presidential election and only 29 percent pulled the lever for donald trump still could what seems a moderate liberal skew in high school classes really produce a generation that likes socialism more than capitalism a simple test of the influence of high school teachers is to look at views of the vietnam war which would surely be presented extremely negatively by left wing instructors somewhat surprisingly a 2013 poll of 19 to 29 year olds discovered that only 43 percent thought the vietnam war was a mistake compared with 69 percent of respondents over 50 if left wing high school teachers managed to produce a generation broadly sympathetic with american military action in southeast asia it s hard to see how those teachers could also be responsible for turning out young socialists no the socialist surge is new and it marks a shift in american politics away from the cold war norm it is rooted i believe more in the events of the past 15 years than in the biases of educators i ve taught at harvard since 1992 and the changes in the students as they arrive seem far more profound than any changes in the classroom incoming students have reacted to events by rejecting the political status quo a wave of campus activism began with the post 9 11 wars of the george w bush years unlike the vietnam war the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq empaneled no draft boards for most college kids the wars remained far away in 2005 and 2006 young americans were more likely to support the iraq war than were older americans as late as 2013 19 to 29 year old gallup respondents split almost evenly on the war s merits the iraq war nevertheless mobilized a hard core of campus protesters who gathered in one case within earshot of my office to relive the glories of their parents or grandparents fight against the vietnam war thousands marched in washington to protest the iraq conflict on the day of president bush s second inauguration further the muddled outcomes of the post 9 11 american military interventions together with the end of the cold war weakened the national security case for being on the right in 2002 according to gallup 50 percent of americans thought the gop was better at protecting americans from military and terrorist threats with only 31 percent giving the edge to democrats by 2007 the republican advantage was gone then the great recession struck over the past 12 years america s economic travails have had a far greater impact on the young than has any national security concern the republican party which embraced capitalism was in the driver s seat when the financial meltdown and subsequent recession began but that would change financiers some drawing large paychecks amid a collapse that they helped trigger proved easy to vilify the crisis thankfully didn t spiral into a second great depression but it didn t end quickly either the generation that turned 21 in 2006 had a rough decade in 2010 the jobless rate for 25 to 34 year old men stood at 21 8 percent two years later the rate had fallen only to 19 8 percent even by 2018 after almost a decade of recovery joblessness among young men remained alarmingly high 13 9 percent this long period of high joblessness coincided with wage stagnation real median wages for men over age 16 were lower from 2010 to 2016 than they had been in 2009 or 2001 or 1982 at the same time younger americans could see wealthier older people getting richer the stock market enjoyed an almost unremitting rise from 2009 to 2018 housing markets recovered nicely from the financial crisis especially in coastal america faced with this reality many younger americans began to listen to left wing critics of president obama who argued that the crisis lingered because the administration was too timid in its reforms in part because it was too friendly with wall street in 2011 the occupy movement came to wall street and to colleges though movement speakers were often incoherent they made clear their dislike for capitalism and their dislike for the need for compromise that the founders had built in to america s political system regnant orthodoxies often come under fire during moments of economic and political crisis if president obama had possessed the political skills of franklin roosevelt he might have articulated a worldview that captured the imagination of the young but while his personal approval remains high among democratic voters obama never championed a clear philosophy of government in the absence of ideological leadership new voices found listeners among economically struggling millennials some rejected globalization embracing a populist economic nationalism others voiced the radical view that markets themselves were to blame for economic stagnation and that capitalism needed replacing since the status quo seemed to be performing poorly especially for the young why not try socialism nevertheless many younger americans remain fundamentally uncommitted they re not die hard socialists if the friends of freedom want a way into their hearts and minds however they ll need an updated message that speaks to millennials hopes and fears with the caveat that i m no political strategist here are my suggestions on what might work we should recognize that millennials like entrepreneurship a 2016 gallup survey found that 90 percent of 18 to 29 year olds viewed entrepreneurs positively ninety eight percent looked favorably on small businesses in fact the youngest respondents had the most enthusiasm both for socialism and for small businesses and entrepreneurship even with their socialist sympathies millennials have not lost sight of the dynamism that comes from private enterprise this makes sense after all children born in 1992 have lived through a series of public sector failures and private sector successes apple s ipod arrived when they were nine enabling them to listen to a library of music that they could carry in their pocket the iphone appeared in 2007 just in time to turbocharge their teenage social life facebook twitter instagram amazon all became mass phenomena during their lifetime a group with so much exposure to the power of entrepreneurship should be open to the notion that private sector energy not government control opens a better path to widespread employment less expensive housing and superior medical care but millennials won t fall for a pure laissez faire pitch the teens of the reagan era like myself may have believed that the republican program of shrinking bureaucracy was exactly what was needed to liberate the economy for millennials republican stewardship brought financial chaos and economic underperformance my more libertarian friends point out that the gop s passion for economic liberty rarely translated into action they argue too that the 2007 housing crash would ve been far less devastating if the government hadn t been subsidizing gambling on the housing market with the home mortgage interest deduction and the loose mortgage underwriting of quasi governmental entities freddie mac and fannie mae yet for many millennials the call to scale back government s role sounds like an excuse for inaction rather than a real plan to reduce their economic frustrations a better approach might be to channel a mixture of supreme court justice louis brandeis free market icon milton friedman and recent nobel prizewinning economist edward phelps and call for a new freedom that would be guided intelligently toward solving social problems when woodrow wilson campaigning for president in 1912 evoked brandeis by saying that if america is not to have free enterprise then she can have freedom of no sort whatever his supporters heard a call for muscular reform not a defense of the status quo in our day empowering small businesses could mean slashing onerous regulations that stop small shops from opening in immigrant neighborhoods a brandeis style reform agenda could include rewarding pharmaceutical companies for lifesaving innovations in ways that don t grant them lengthy monopolies or discouraging local governments from giving favored treatment to large companies to get them to relocate or stay milton friedman was a champion of free markets but one of his most successful ideas school vouchers envisioned public incentives that would encourage entrepreneurs to solve social problems friedman understood the failure of state monopoly provision of public schooling he wanted to empower parents and startups to create better schools friedman s vision could be extended to other pressing social problems from inner city undereducation to the reintegration of newly released convicts in the friedmanite vision the public sector establishes the financial incentives but private entrepreneurs come up with the ingenious solutions silicon valley moguls seem to think that they can solve any puzzle except perhaps the chronic underemployment of less skilled americans including millennials that s where phelps comes in he proposes using the tax code to subsidize job creation a policy that encourages entrepreneurs to employ more workers could include tax subsidies to firms and workers like the earned income tax credit and reforming public policies like disability insurance and food stamps so that they did less to discourage work millennials came of age during the great recession which left many of them struggling to find work ashley gilbertson vii redux the case for liberty is about more than material gains which the defenders of markets must remember more often for most of the past quarter century the advocates of economic freedom have made their case primarily by arguing that low taxes lead to economic prosperity both in the immediate sense that families get to keep more of their earnings and in the systemic sense that strong economic incentives generate higher levels of output the moral argument has been less prevalent by contrast the left wing case at least at times has combined castigation of apparent economic injustices with a call for empathy and compassion bernie sanders declares that his very strong spiritual feeling is that when children go hungry when veterans sleep out on the street that impacts me this cri de coeur resonated with younger americans in the past effective promoters of liberty like ronald reagan have emphasized that the case for economic freedom is more spiritual than material socialists ignore the side of man that is the spirit they can provide you shelter fill your belly with bacon and beans treat you when you re ill all the things guaranteed to a prisoner or a slave they don t understand that we also dream reagan s argument remains a potent condemnation of leftist chimeras including growing enthusiasm for the universal basic income particularly among silicon valley elites who see artificial intelligence and robotics as potentially obliterating millions of jobs what kind of nation would america be if say 40 percent of adults subsisted entirely on government handouts the data on joblessness show the broken spirits of those lacking the sense of purpose and social connections that come with work the make work public employment guarantees advanced by democratic senator kirsten gillibrand and other politicians seem almost as soul killing the fight for economic freedom must instead celebrate the ordinary americans who bring a smile to their customers faces while serving them a coffee or employers who generate jobs for the less skilled we are indeed in a race of man against machine as new technologies threaten to replace many forms of ordinary work entrepreneurial imagination is the best way to ensure that workers laid off today will be able to find new productive jobs tomorrow satisfaction comes from doing not from having and freedom not socialism empowers doing any new freedom narrative should also point out that many nonprofit leaders like geoffrey canada of the harlem s children zone educational organization are also entrepreneurs habitat for humanity and teach for america are just two entrepreneurial nonprofits that struggle with excessive government regulation socialism s current appeal rests partly on the fact as we ve seen that for many it stands for caring for the poor it needs to be defined again as what it truly is my former student laura nicolae of romanian descent offered a powerful counterargument to our intellectual carelessness about socialism in a recent harvard crimson op ed she writes after spending four years on a campus saturated with marxist memes and jokes about communist revolutions my classmates will graduate with the impression that communism represents a light hearted critique of the status quo rather than an empirically violent philosophy that destroyed millions of lives nicolae chose to combat this ignorance by telling how her father ran from a government that beat tortured and brainwashed its citizens and how his childhood friend disappeared after scrawling an insult about the dictator on the school bathroom wall and that his neighbors starved to death from food rations designed to combat obesity it s vital to remember that socialism the ideology of marx meant state ownership of the means of production such a system creates a government so powerful that abuse of citizens is practically guaranteed scandinavian social democracies like sweden and denmark are not socialist in any meaningful sense they re capitalist societies with extensive welfare states if you think swedish pensions are too generous you can argue against them but don t argue as many on the right do that they are tantamount to socialist control of the economy similarly when obamacare is demonized as socialism then millions of young people who want a more inclusive safety net start thinking that they must be socialists too this is no mere misuse of language calling themselves socialist the young open themselves to orwellian notions like socialism means freedom freedom say from the need to smile for the sake of a sale as corey robin put it that markets incentivize kindness is a good thing one great evil of socialist states is that they eliminated any financial reason to be friendly yielding generations of dour apparatchiks whose success came from subservience to their political masters not pleasing the public another step let freedom serve the young the unhappiness that many millennials have with the status quo reflects an economy that has too often protected insiders at outsiders expense in manufacturing firms older unionized workers earn far more than similarly skilled younger workers occupational licensing restricts the competitive chances of new workers economic freedom will become much more compelling to 25 year olds when they see how often public interventions have benefited the entrenched at the expense of the young the regulatory bias toward the old is particularly evident in housing policy consider california s proposition 13 passed overwhelmingly in 1978 the measure may have struck a blow against rising property taxes but by ensuring that home value assessments cannot rise more quickly than the rate of inflation unless the house is sold it glaringly favors the old over the young as california s housing prices have risen steadily since 1976 old homeowners wind up paying a tiny fraction of the taxes paid by younger more recent buyers an additional downside of prop 13 is that it tends to lock older homeowners in place if they move they lose the tax advantage that comes from their ultralow property assessment california s onerous housing regulations add to the dysfunction of the state s housing market by making it hard to build some limits originated with the state courts in cases like 1972 s friends of mammoth which mandated extensive environmental impact reviews for all large building projects in other instances local regulations have limited new construction with policies like the 60 acre minimum lot sizes that exist in parts of marin county this creates housing shortages that drive up prices recent research that i ve conducted with wharton s joseph gyourko looks at the generational accumulation of housing wealth in 1983 the 75th percentile 25 to 34 year old had 45 000 in home value thirty years later that same group had only 21 000 of net housing wealth among 65 to 74 year olds by contrast the 75th percentile household s net housing wealth rose from 150 000 to 225 000 over that period and the 95th percentile s climbed from 427 000 to 700 000 housing is the main store of wealth for most americans and regulations have clearly helped redistribute wealth from young home buyers to old home sellers the tendency of government regulation to entrench incumbents is hardly limited to housing elizabeth warren has proposed that employee representatives make up 40 percent of all corporate boards such representatives might look after the interests of incumbent employees but they would have little incentive to care about new workers a pervasive feature of labor markets in social democracies is a large gap between insiders and outsiders and the young inevitably begin as outsiders the case for socialism starts with anger against a system that seems to increase inequality and leave the most vulnerable unprotected but we can enhance upward mobility and create a better safety net by empowering entrepreneurship and redirecting existing funding the connection between entrepreneurial freedom and mobility is easy to make social insurance is harder to fit within the case for a new freedom but to succeed today the case for liberty must also make peace with reasonable protections against economic and physical calamity entrepreneurship can improve social mobility because so many new americans make their own futures by starting businesses we could do much more to help them appallingly america regulates the entrepreneurship of the wealthy far less stringently than it regulates the entrepreneurship of the poor if a harvard undergraduate wants to launch an internet firm in his dorm it might accumulate 1 billion users before regulators start paying attention if a haitian immigrant wants to start a grocery in harvard square that say sells milk he must cut through a dense thicket of local regulations we should apply more rigorous cost benefit analysis to local regulations and set up one stop permitting for local entrepreneurs with permitting offices fluent in several languages mentoring programs with older entrepreneurs providing guidance to young protégés would also help spark business creation we should experiment with after school programs that teach entrepreneurship relevant skills entrepreneurship fires job creation which we will need more than ever we must ensure too that our tax policies encourage firms to hire new workers and that our wage and labor regulations don t discourage firms from hiring them entrepreneurship can improve social mobility because so many new americans start businesses finally entrepreneurship can also be part of providing better schooling and cheaper health care not all charter schools which operate free from sundry labor restrictions of traditional public schools are great but in many communities they provide a successful alternative to conventional schools i would also like to see vocational training provided after school on weekends and over the summer but entrepreneurship isn t enough on its own the most entrepreneurial economy in the world won t provide insurance against mental illness or ensure that every person gets a steady income the advocates of liberty have often turned their backs on social insurance but if they want to be relevant to a new generation they can t keep doing that nevertheless the new freedom should emphasize that social insurance in the u s today represents a massive transfer from young to old medicare and social security are vast government programs funded by taxes on the young and that benefit people over the age of 65 who are often wealthy a proposal compatible with the cause of freedom is to make our social insurance system fairer even if total spending remains constant means testing benefits would be a great start cost containment for medicare and medicaid would provide trillions of extra dollars we can offer more meaningful social insurance for the poor and young if we stop spending so much on the wealthy and old the current vogue for socialism among the young does not mean that most twentysomethings want the government to run pizzerias and gaming platforms but many do want more government control over sectors of the economy old ideological tethers have largely dissolved and america is at risk of moving in a far more statist direction in this new wide open world the cause of capitalism has struggled republicans won the 2016 elections primarily due to older whiter voters many of whom were suspicious of markets the future could increasingly belong to the radical left even socialists in the true sense of the term the global shift to the left after world war i and the great depression called forth a generation of legendary scholars friedrich hayek karl popper and friedman among others who used their voices to advocate for freedom not only because of its economic benefits but also because all humans deserve a chance to chart their destiny free from the overweening grip of the state today a new generation must make the

commentary countries that abandoned beijing after the initial one belt one road obor summit in 2017 have re congregated under the chinese flag in mutual support of its second summit event this includes new member switzerland as well as malaysia and myanmar which previously complained to the united states and the international monetary fund imf that investing in china caused them to fall into a debt trap countries submit their allegiance compared with the first summit in may 2017 the second summit has several points of attraction first countries have adjusted their expectations of the chinese communist party ccp although there is a general expectation for large amounts of ccp funding the estimates are far more realistic than the 2017 target during the first summit in 2017 china s foreign exchange reserves were falling sharply and on may 4 zhou xiaochuan governor of the people s bank of china published an article in a chinese financial magazine the main points were investment and financial cooperation for obor isn t unilateral financial support but requires all parties to jointly build a common interest community to share the expenditures risks and benefits at the same time emphasis must be placed on market based financing and active use of the chinese yuan to generate more in local savings and international capital to put it bluntly china said that future investment should make the chinese yuan the main source of capital and obor partners should make joint investments that was disappointing to countries that came with hopes of seeking the support of the u s dollar that sparked a 2017 international incident obor countries called for an end to the chinese project claimed to the imf that china had increased their debts demanded that the imf provide assistance and finally convinced the united states to support a narrative that obor created a debt trap for participating countries with these experiences the expectations of participating countries for the second summit weren t as high as the first with many countries just testing the waters the attitude of italy is typical as long as china has money it s fine the second summit also included a number of important new members two european countries italy and switzerland attended italy is the first g 7 member country to participate in the obor program and the symbolism is self evident switzerland s participation is even more important an article published by the bbc a day before the summit has a clear understanding of this first switzerland has the most prestigious financial services industry in the world secondly switzerland is home to numerous international organizations for china switzerland s unique neutral political status is of paramount importance to obor while germany is dissatisfied with that its problem with italy isn t so much in its participation rather germany insists on maintaining a position as a european leader controlling the eu s collective bargaining power third the chinese government has been very tactical in placing its focus on economic cooperation and has promised to be in line with international regulations these statements have given participating countries very good reasons to cooperate china launched the one belt one road initiative in 2013 according to refinitiv the total value of the project is 3 7 trillion spanning dozens of countries in asia europe africa oceania and south america at the first obor summit china had a sense of expansion propagating the chinese model and espousing that china will become the new leader of globalization that raised alarm in some countries during the trade war the united states raised various criticisms questioning china s red expansion which also caused some obor countries to waver during the second summit beijing softened its tone and shifted its focus to resolving the doubts in various countries for example it proposed to conduct a joint study with the world bank on environmental and social standards of obor building a framework for debt sustainability analysis to prevent debt risk was its explanation for concerns regarding obor s transparency and ideology export the draft communiqué also clearly stated that the 37 global leaders attending the april 25 27 summit would reach an agreement on project financing issues comply with global debt targets and promote sustainable development since october 2018 malaysia and several other countries accused china of leading them into a debt trap a criticism the united states shares on oct 3 2018 the u s senate approved the investments leading to development act of 2018 build by a vote of 93 6 under the measure the original overseas private investment corporation opic and other development aid agencies will be integrated to form a new u s international development finance corp the new agency which is to receive 60 billion in funding is responsible for providing assistance loans to developing countries for infrastructure projects such as energy ports and water supply however when it comes to using state resources democratic countries are a lot more restricted and far less efficient than authoritarian states such china efficiency that s due to a disregard for people s livelihoods therefore u s investment is only part of a plan but china has actually put in real money countries all over the world are now facing a common problem domestic unemployment for example while italy s employment rate is now at its lowest in seven years its youth unemployment rate at the end of 2018 was as high as almost 31 percent the youth unemployment rate in greece in january 2019 also remained at nearly 40 percent to each country s respective leader what s important isn t helping rid the world of tyrannical rule but solving its own employment problems amid opposition from the eu s major powers italy chose to cooperate with china unilaterally an attitude based on realistic considerations from the windowsill of one s home this china s construction in the italian port of vado ligure is certainly not beautiful scenery but it can bring jobs so it is a good thing for vado ligure a town with a population of 8 000 chinese investment has brought about 400 jobs which has pleased both the local government and its residents the mayor told deutsche welle that a strong investment partner is able to bring new opportunities and new capital at the same time under the control of a series of treaties contracts and regulations there is no need to worry that chinese capital will cause issues of debt or labor rights violations the chinese are not a problem they bring money and are greatly welcomed the mayor said it s the same principle for croatia nigeria and other countries money is the most important link for china in maintaining relations with countries two years ago sri lanka due to an inability to repay chinese loans related to the construction of the port of hambantota leased the entire port to china for a period of 99 years this incident has been criticized as a classic case of the obor debt trap and it appears that countries seem to have forgotten the market principle of debt repayment actually digging back this kind of thinking has its roots western media is left leaning and has always placed a priority on value systems the importance of the economy and especially the role of the united states in the world economy has always been a little underemphasized however after democrats won the majority in the house of representatives in the 2018 midterm elections socialist policies have become the preference of the democratic party moving farther from the main topic of concern for u s voters concerned western media often unconsciously cite a famous quote that bill clinton used to defeat incumbent president george h w bush in the 1992 campaign it s the economy stupid i thus wish to use this opportunity to remind left wing politicians around the world that only by playing economics can they win voters in fact this truth applies not only to the politics of all countries in the world but also the reason why countries are rushing into china s obor debt trap because only by obtaining china s money can they have the capital to play economics at home and attract voters originally economic development was a country s personal matter but after world war ii the state of the cold war between the united states and the soviet union caused other countries to become accustomed to a following approach in addition to ideological reasons each country especially countries without very strong ideologies could choose a side and receive financial assistance of a major economy many small and medium sized countries have no methods for developing their economies but made use of u s soviet contention to play political seesaw they would stand on whichever side gave more benefits the united states since world war ii has assumed the public good of maintaining international order believing it to be the embodiment of their own soft power other countries also take it for granted that this is the united states responsibility and don t feel a need to give thanks on the other hand china is very aware of the power of money and has been using it to wrestle relations within the united nations it has fully demonstrated the important influence money has on developing countries in human rights affairs remnant of cold war model according to the official statistics of the chinese communist party as of march 2019 china has signed different cooperation agreements with 125 countries these countries account for 36 percent of the world s gdp and 60 percent of the world s total population are such strenuous efforts really just for winning business opportunities of course not during the second obor summit china did a lot of explanatory work to quell doubts of the outside world countries have accepted china s explanations believing that beijing s use of comprehensive transportation and infrastructure to bring the continents of europe and asia closer is beneficial to deepening trade and human contact but these countries understand the geostrategic significance of obor the purpose is to establish a system with china as the core causing countries to in the process of cooperation with china establish a high dependence on beijing through the implementation of obor china would have the right to formulate rules and regulations and reshape the global structure countries also understand that the united states has long expressed dissatisfaction with that plan the u s strategic community generally believes that the ccp s continued promotion of obor construction mustn t be ignored it not only has the potential to change the geo economic and geopolitical balance of eurasia but also poses a real threat to the united states in fields such as technological standards military security and international development it even undermines the foundation of the global hegemony established by the united states since world war ii therefore the united states definitely won t tolerate china s strong challenges in this regard the power struggle between the two superpowers will inevitably bring opportunities to many countries in the world seeking financial support as for the countries vying to jump into china s debt trap they are merely making a slight change to the new thinking of depend on china for economic interests depend on the united states for political security formed by asian countries post cold war making a return to the cold war era seesaw model situations such as that of mid october 2018 when countries such as malaysia cried out to the imf and the united states will inevitably reoccur because complaining is also a way to sell the right to follow
central bank annual report 2018 central bank governor dr indrajit coomaraswamy presenting the annual report 2018 to minister of finance mangala samaraweera end april state minister of finance eran wickramaratne ministry of finance secretary and monetary board ex officio member dr r h s samaratunga senior deputy governor dr p nandalal weerasinghe assistant governor swarna gunaratne central bank acting director economic research dr chandranath amarasekara and additional director of economic research dr p k g harischandra are also present converting hard labour to fruition the annual report of the central bank for 2018 analysing in minute detail the state of the country s economy today and outlining the prospects for the next five years has just been released available at it is a report of the monetary board the legal body that manages the central bank presented to the public through the minister of finance but it is crafted by a technical team working under the bank s director of economic research incorporating numerous inputs contributed by the other departments of the bank as well it is customary for this technical team to work day and night especially during the first three months of the year to bring this report to fruition use of graphical pictures to illustrate key points improving the presentation style significantly this year s annual report has liberally used graphic pictures to synthesise the main messages presented in different chapters of the report an eye catching graphic presentation has been the snapshot of national output expenditure and income 2018 appearing on page 48 of the report dissecting the national output by sources and causes this graphic figure presents the whole story about the country s total output by means of a single picture anyone desirous of understanding the structure of the economy and numerous interconnections involved should carefully study this single graphic presentation hence the bank s technical staff that has laboured to produce this report should deserve commendation by all alarmingly declining growth rates however an important line graph which has been obscured by other colourful presentations has depicted the sad story of sri lanka s economic performance during the last four year period showing the annual real economic growth rate during the reign of the present government it has drawn a downward spiralling staircase with a growth of 5 in 2015 but falling continuously since then to reach the lowest stair of 3 2 in 2018 on average the annual growth during this period has been at 4 and when it is adjusted for an annual population growth of about 1 the real income per person known as the per capita income or pci has increased only by 3 a rate much below the planned growth rate of 8 needed to become a rich country within a generation thus as i have argued previously it is four wasted years which cannot be recovered by sri lanka now available at need for quick recovery measures hence what the government whether it is this government or any other government that would come to power in the future should do is to plan for a quick economic recovery in the next few years and lay foundation for a firm and consistent high economic growth in the subsequent 20 to 30 year period the strategies for economic recovery during the next few years is essential since the central bank itself has painted a gloomy economic picture for the country in the years to come according to its predictions growth will slightly recover in 2019 to 4 and move upward sluggishly to about 5 during 2021 to 2023 this is a little higher than what the international agencies like the world bank and the asian development bank have predicted for sri lanka which is on average below 4 per annum even that higher prediction of the central bank is still on average below 5 a growth rate woefully inadequate to deliver prosperity to sri lankans this is a warning signal that cannot be ignored by the government what the government whether it is this government or any other government that would come to power in the future should do is to plan for a quick economic recovery in the next few years and lay foundation for a firm and consistent high economic growth in the subsequent 20 to 30 year period the strategies for economic recovery during the next few years is essential since the central bank

that higher prediction of the central bank is still on average below 5 a growth rate woefully inadequate to deliver prosperity to sri lankans this is a warning signal that cannot be ignored by the government synthesis presented in chapter 1 chapter 1 of the bank s annual report is a prerogative of its director of economic research the officer historically known as the brain of the bank synthesising the detailed analysis made in the rest of the report the director usually presents a summary of the behaviour of the key sectors in the economy on top of this he or she presents a prediction of its performance in the next five year period in the light of the expected developments in the global economy which has serious bearing on sri lanka this is then followed by an outline of the policy to be followed by the government if it is desirous of supporting economic recovery on a sustainable basis gloomy forecast and essential economic reforms since the predictions made for the next five years are gloomy this year s annual report has come up with a set of essential economic reforms that have to be implemented by the government on a priority basis in my view the policy package in the present annual report highlighting what the government should do and what it should not to do is a comprehensive set dealing with the policy reforms needed in all the areas if any political party contesting the next election is interested in mapping out its economic strategy for sustained high growth this section surely provides the base for it economic reforms to address the low growth conundrum economic growth in the last four years has been low by any standard but the central bank apparently not willing to embarrass the government has chosen to call it a moderate growth according to the bank the reasons for this so called moderate growth have been the postponement of the structural economic reforms which the country should have undertaken many years ago these reforms had been recommended by international lending organisations such as the international monetary fund world bank and the asian development bank for some time at the same time the domestic private sector chambers too had advocated for them yet all the successive governments demonstrating their inability to manage economic policy programmes properly had either abandoned them midway after embarking on them or not tried out at all for fear of antagonising certain quarters in society ignoring the needed reforms in the past to the top policymakers in the previous mahinda rajapaksa government reforms had been an anathema the present government started its career after the general elections in august 2015 with many promises of economic reforms as pronounced by prime minister ranil wickremesinghe in the first economic policy statement delivered in parliament in november 2015 there were promises about tax reforms making the central bank independent integrating sri lanka seamlessly to global trade trade facilitating bilateral agreements with almost all the countries in the world and converting sri lanka s low tech production base to a high tech base to plan out these reforms an economic summit was held in colombo in january 2016 with the support from the george soros foundation and harvard university s centre for international development yet the achievements on economic reforms during the four year period have been less than expected it is ironic that now the central bank has to remind the government of the need for moving into action on the country s reform agenda if the country is to accelerate its economic growth to required levels key reforms needed the bank has identified in its annual report for 2018 the key areas of failure by the government on this count incidentally they had all been promised in the government s first economic policy statement according to the central bank these failures have been in the areas such as measures for export promotion attraction of foreign direct investments or fdis reduction of budget deficits and debt levels reform of factor markets to make them more conducive for growth strengthening of the government s administrative machinery and observation of the rule of law the failure to undertake these structural reforms has not only contributed to the country s low economic growth but also made it a laggard among its peer countries this is observable when one compares sri lanka with bangladesh while sri lanka s average economic growth during 2014 18 has been at around 4 bangladesh had managed to maintain on average a growth rate of about 6 5 during this period despite many natural calamities political disputes and terrorist attacks an important line graph which has been obscured by other colourful presentations has depicted the sad story of sri lanka s economic performance during the last four year period showing the annual real economic growth rate during the reign of the present government it has drawn a downward spiralling staircase with a growth of 5 in 2015 but falling continuously since then to reach the lowest stair of 3 2 in 2018 no more cheap labour the bank has also noted that sri lanka no longer has cheap labour and a young labour force according to estimates made by the world bank in its sri lanka development update 2019 the country s working age population has peaked in 2005 and begun to decline since then thus the country can no longer enjoy the luxury of moving toward labour intensive industries such as apparel industry hence improvements in productivity and efficiency are a must for the country to move up from a middle income country to a rich country a feat known as beating the middle income trap the failure will result in trapping the country in the middle income category forever enhance value addition of exportable raw materials via advanced technology sri lanka has been exporting natural resources in raw material form and the bank in its recommendations has advocated for enhancing their value added so that the country could get not only better prices for same but also increase the overall export earnings but this requires the adoption of high technology to process these raw materials into value added products high technology in the very short run had to be acquired from countries that have developed it though the bank has not spelt it out one way to acquire high technology immediately has been the attraction of global companies to the country either as joint ventures or fdis when the country does so it has to choose products which have huge market potential in the future in an era where electrical vehicles are being promoted across the globe better and more efficient batteries will be demanded by users if sri lanka goes into partnership with an international company like tesla or panasonic it is possible for the country to tap this market easily in the medium to long run technology can be developed within the country by engaging its universities and research institutions in this connection sri lanka can learn a lesson or two from thailand which is presently on a move to increase its high tech production base to support this move its universities are competitively getting connected to high tech firms in china taiwan japan and south korea in addition to providing support services to local high tech companies wide reforms to promote trade competitiveness the increase in the earnings from the export of merchandise goods and services will enable the country according to the central bank to meet foreign exchange liabilities more confidently in the future for that purpose the bank has recommended that barriers to trade have to be removed in this respect the new trade policy announced by the government has called for wide reforms in the trade sector to promote the country s competitiveness this includes bringing the country to a uniform tariff regime by eliminating numerous tariff measures in force and para tariff that has been enforced a single simple tariff system will always help exporters to sell their goods and services to foreigners fdis to bring in new technology the bank has also recommended that fdis should be routed to more productive sectors in the economy sri lanka or for that matter any emerging economy in the world cannot have the luxury of attracting every type of fdis today this was the policy adopted by sri lanka in the initial phase of opening its economy to foreign investors it helped sri lanka to establish a world class apparel industry that provided an imitation effect to local entrepreneurs over the years it therefore contributed to the transmission of the export structure from predominantly agriculture based exports to manufacturing based exports now apparels are on shored or near shored however today it faces several challenges due to loss of cheap labour on the one hand and the presence of new competitor countries such as bangladesh and myanmar on the other the worst scenario has arisen due to new production systems adopted by apparel consuming western nations taking advantage of robotisation and automation both north america and western europe have begun to establish apparel factories on their own lands a system known as on shoring or re shoring as against off shoring that had ruled the world a few decades ago this has been strengthened by the need for having garments within a short delivery time like three to four days in this context garments produced by sri lanka will take about 30 days to be delivered to the market but the factories located close to the market in countries now known as near shoring such as turkey morocco in europe and mexico and honduras in north america will deliver them to the markets within a short time span thus sri lanka has no choice but to change from the present low tech production system to high tech production systems this has been cogently recommended by the central bank in its annual report for 2018 tear free understanding of cb reports one of the weaknesses in the central bank annual reports has been that they are presented in technical language not easily comprehensible by ordinary readers hence it is necessary to write commentaries on the annual report to facilitate tear free understanding despite these weaknesses they contain a wealth of information hence it will not be a waste of time if the top leaders of the government spend some time in perusing and understanding the messages that have been delivered in the report for 2018 w a wijewardena a former deputy governor of the central bank of

the government should expeditiously review the minimum tax threshold in line with monetary developments in the economy to cushion low income earners against rising prices of basic goods the zimbabwe coalition on debt and development zimcodd has said by mthandazo nyoni the government should expeditiously review the minimum tax threshold in line with monetary developments in the economy to cushion low income earners against rising prices of basic goods the zimbabwe coalition on debt and development zimcodd has said zimbabweans celebrated a review of the free tax threshold from us 300 to us 350 early this year but the gains were shortlived following the removal of the 1 1 exchange rate between the rtgs dollar and the united states dollar following the policy pronouncement people s disposable incomes were eroded excessively by the failure to review the minimum tax threshold using the central bank rate of us rtgs at us 1 rtgs 3 2 as of april 25 2019 zimcodd noted that monthly incomes of us 110 or the rtgs equivalent were now being subjected to taxation this defeats the purpose of reviewing the free tax threshold from us 300 to us 350 in the 2019 fiscal policy this is incomparable to south africa s monthly minimum tax threshold of us 450 zimcodd said fundamentally the discord between the monetary and fiscal policies signifies policy inconsistency and incoherence whose implications on the ordinary citizens undermine the very essence of having a government that serves the interest of its citizens zimcodd said the pain associated with the austerity for prosperity mantra seemed to be excessively unbearable beyond what finance minister mthuli ncube envisaged if no relief is sought immediately the pain will persist into the medium and long term putting the country in a worse off position the coalition said the government should expeditiously review the minimum tax threshold in line with the monetary developments brought by the monetary policy of 2019 basically the initial rtgs tax free threshold should be set by multiplying the us amount by the existing exchange rate zimcodd said the policy review should be issued through a government gazette which provides for tax refunds to individuals whose incomes were taxed from the time the monetary policy took effect it added the fact that the devaluation of the rtgs dollar was aimed at addressing the exchange rate challenges that arose from the black market rates and multi tier pricing its net effect on the economy is devastating to economic agents and consumers people with fixed incomes and essentially all businesses that rely on imports zimcodd noted that imported fuel food and raw materials had become more expensive zimbabweans are caught in between a rock and hard surface as they entirely rely on imports implying an increase in cost push inflation it is very unfortunate that the final consumer becomes the greatest loser in this economic matrix the organisation said with worsening macroeconomic performance the rise in inflation is not matched by a corresponding increase in aggregate demand it is very unfortunate that devaluation was not matched by an increase in real wages and salaries worse still there was no deliberate decision to cushion workers against devaluation and the corresponding rise in inflation zimcodd said an act of parliament should be enacted to make the synchronisation of monetary and fiscal policies mandatory to safeguard the interests of zimbabweans and the economy this will put an end to the prevailing macroeconomic distortions fuelled by the policy inconsistencies and incoherence it said
i m sure many people would contest that comparing the koch brothers who deal in fossils fuels with bill gates who provides vaccines in africa a bit of a stretch however i m going to suggest that they have much more in common than we d like to admit if we observe their methods and ultimately what is achieved there are some striking similarities sure conservatives like the devos s and the koch s morally conduct their affairs differently to zuckerberg or gates but are they really so distinct you could sensibly propose that bill gates s life is more virtuous than the koch s this indeed is a compelling argument but is it true when we consider the two groups right wing neoliberal oligarchs and philanthrocapitalists also oligarchs apart from obscene amounts of money both sects share their unquestionable desire for power and control i will offer that power and control are intrinsically linked some semblance of control over your own group rival factions or even the general populace is required to gain power that said to control certainly on an external level requires some exertion of power either through elections coercion or even physical force the extent and methods required depends on your resources and who you intend to control to obtain power or conversely who you will overpower to wrestle control at this stage it would be sensible to lay out what these seemingly opposing tribes both morally and politically have in common and of course how they differ to finish i will argue that the overall goals of oligarchs regardless of their flavour are strikingly similar by the very existence of their extreme wealth i think it s safe to assume that all oligarch s share a strong deep conviction towards the free market each side fully subscribes to the idea of utilising their wealth to shape the world often at the expense of democratic processes unsurprisingly many would argue that the koch s and bill gates share nothing in common concluding that one wants to continue extracting fossil fuels at the expense of the planet while the other tries to save lives but if the outcome is all that matters rather than the process surely we must ask ourselves hard questions regarding the importance of democracy this dilemma arises due to billionaires not being democratically elected and yet able to use considerable influence to effect major changes good bad or indifferent it has been offered by philosophers and social psychologists alike that huge wealth generates social distance or ethical independence put simply the rich have no need to cooperate or partake in democracy to get what they require neoliberal leaders often fit into the more recognisable guise of bombastic power hungry ceo s trampling on all that resembles competition there s no doubt that these individuals exist see jeff bezos for details worse still the system justifies their behaviour by spinning yarns of homo economicus trickle down economics and picturing them as job creators however in our midst are those who present as an arguably more agreeable face of power and control they appear on ted talks are promoted by the mainstream media and portrayed as modern day saviours these are the neoliberal left or philanthrocapitalists and their influence on society is as pervasive as the koch brothers carefully crafted characters such as gates and zuckerberg are considered to be oracles of the 21st century they mould our world from a position of exclusivity that is only experienced by a handful of people and yet we so easily defer to their perceived wisdom historically speaking the stage that allowed these actors on both sides to perform so freely is neoliberalism this was first conceived by among others friedrich hayek and ludwig von mises in the late 1930 s but failed to gain much traction in the west this all changed when keynesian economics started to falter in the mid 1970 s when the time arose the objective for thatcher uk reagan us and roger douglas in new zealand was to change the moral and political record a collective society based on human capital full employment and relative equality was abruptly abandoned for competition individualism and the idea that wealth is virtuous out of the rubble of a dismantled social democratic society rose a small number of individuals who were uniquely positioned to capitalise on increased privatisation laxed trade regulations and an ever financialised world this accumulation of capital is rarely reinvested in society and the people within it but used to create a system that accrues ever more wealth power and influence the elite are in a position to apply pressure at the governmental level for maximum effect with some tactics being cruder than others neoliberalism provides the means that ensures money is sucked out from underneath the mattresses of the poor to the heavily guarded vaults of the rich these mechanisms are the nucleotides of the neoliberal dna international trade agreements decreased market regulations low taxation privatisation and reduced government spending are just a few examples for decades this ideology of neoliberalism has been supported by the likes of international monetary fund and the world bank these institutions have been instrumental in forcing desperate sovereign nations to adopt strict austerity measures to reduce debt by offering an all strings attached bailout package as witnessed in greece in effect these loans had nothing to do with greece s economic problem these were purely constructed to pay off their debts to french and german banks it has since been recorded less than 10 of the cash borrowed was actually used to reform the economy and to help the greek people as if the world s oligarchs don t have enough systemic advantages many invest heavily in think tanks and varying institutions solely to persuade government s to tip the scales further in their favour one such right wing funding source are the previously mentioned koch brothers charles and david koch are co owners of koch industries the largest privately owned energy company in the us the koch s favourite past time is trying to discredit climate change science and policy solutions in this arena they have spent a massive 127 million funding 92 organisations between 1997 and 2017 the koch s claim to be libertarians supporting drastically lower corporate and personal taxes minimal public services and a massive reduction in regulations their undeniable self interest doesn t stop at muddying the waters regarding climate change the koch s fund a group called the american legislative exchange council alec aimed at making it more difficult to prosecute corporations for violations of environmental and financial law it s important to realise that the koch s do not do all this in isolation rallying 100 s of wealthy conservative families in an effort to preserve and promote their privileged way of life groups such as americans for prosperity are a huge and rich organisation designed to battle against the democrats supporting ultra conservative republicans espousing ideological policies while blocking anything in congress that may oppose the koch s best interests they are the masters of organising astroturf groups these are alleged grassroot citizen organisations or coalitions groups such as americans for prosperity the heartland institute and the 60 plus association support entities such as the competitive enterprise institute and their fight for free speech which of course is nothing of the sort it is a mere cover up for anti science rhetoric supported by 47 groups all affiliated to the koch s further to this the koch s spend millions each election cycle and helped fund the tea party spending upwards of 45 million the koch s also donate millions each year to candidates that suit their ideology this includes past presidential candidate mitt romney interestingly despite spending roughly 900 million during the 2016 election cycle the koch s have already declared that they will not be funding trump next time around in contrast to the brothers grim power and control can also be acquired through more insidious mechanisms such as philanthrocapitalism many of these characters involved in this practice are labelled by the right wing media as lefties this theory seriously suggests that these rich well connected privileged people who attended top universities while using capitalism to rake in huge profits support politics of the left just to clarify the democrats and the left are not synonymous with each other politics in the us like much of the west provides nothing more than varying shades of neoliberalism for the ceo class such as mark zuckerberg bill gates warren buffett and richard branson the question is how can philanthropy be used to reinforce a flawed political and economic system such as capitalism supposedly charitable acts as seen by bill gates are conceptualised using market based solutions looking at costs and benefits it s fair to say that philanthrocapitalism is no more than the social justice arm of a destructive global free market gates has certainly taken advantage of his huge giving power to influence global health policies including the world health organisation where he is their top donor the gates foundation has spent over 1 billion on policy and advocacy even investing in training programs for journalists at major media organisations further to this the foundation has heavily funded research which has later gone on to be published in scientific journals these types of activities must be seen as a threat to global democratic decision making the gates foundation also sits on the board of h8 a self appointed group of 8 health related organisations who have been instrumental in setting up the health agenda for the g8 a group of self important self selected nations both the pretend left and right wing oligarchs share another mission that is to pay as little tax as humanly possible the koch s do this rather bluntly by using astroturf groups and lobbyists to coerce the government into lowering tax levels and provide tax breaks the smarmy army to their left in contrast use charm offensives in 2015 mark zuckerberg and his wife priscilla chan to much fanfare proclaimed that they would donate 99 of their shares in facebook valued at the time at 45 billion to the mission of advancing human potential and promoting equality which all sounds very nice i m sure you ll agree here s the catch zuckerberg did not set up a charitable foundation which would have automatically held a non profit status instead of this zuckerberg established limited liability company llc the mainstream media unsurprisingly failed to mention this instead they continued to gush over this blockbusting moment of perceived altruism unlike a charitable foundation a llc allows someone to make investments in a for profit company while also permitting the owner to make political donations within this framework zuckerberg is free to lobby for changes within the law and can do whatever he desires with his money you may ask what s the problem it s his money indeed but is this really the actions of a charity zuckerberg can also cunningly use this method to avoid tax this can be achieved by donating the appreciated shares to charity which would generate a deduction at fair market value of the stock without triggering any tax clever huh in a nutshell this means zuckerberg has made a ridiculous amount of money for which he is unlikely ever to pay tax on as a society do we really want people like mark zuckerberg or bill gates deciding the direction of our societal needs all governments have flaws but at least there are checks and balances deciding where the money is required with more than one person making the call these oligarchs could have quite easily aided society by paying tax just like everybody else but of course this does not afford them the power or control that they feel they deserve so what have we learnt apart from don t trust rich people well we know billionaires span the entire neoliberal political spectrum from george soros to sheldon adelson from the koch s to michael bloomberg and from tom steyer to robert mercer many of whom remain hidden like puppeteers but some use public recognition to their advantage such as gates and zuckerberg we really shouldn t be remotely surprised that billionaires manipulate governments and society to benefit themselves in some way i am aware that much of this article is us centric however this is not something that is unique to the states similar patterns of oligarchic control can be witnessed all over the world but particularly within the anglosphere all acceptable politics and political parties within the west are shoehorned into a narrow corridor of neoliberalism with only minor differences separating them parties and the politicians from which they belong are criticised and held to intense scrutiny but rarely is this kind of ferocious attention applied to the primary problem this being a political economic system that is thoroughly in chaos held together by outdated concepts some questionable politicians and billionaires who desperately fight to maintain the status quo it s the same system that assures the elite of ever increasing bank balances thus securing more power and control over our ailing planet lets be honest this is not a system for you me or billions of others like us in many ways capitalism is no different to feudalism both possess hierarchies each system serves the chosen few and neither has any interest in the rest of society i suspect it s about time we constructed something anew outside of this tired and repetitive dynamic how about we construct a society that works for everybody oh and we need to do this quickly because the world s a bit screwed up no pressure

welcome to everybody who is listening todayâ s call as usual will be hosted by andreas treichl chief executive officer erste group gernot mittendorfer chief financial officer of erste group and willi cernko chief risk officer of erste group they will lead you through a brief presentation highlighting the achievements of the first quarter 2019 after which time they are ready to take your questions and answer them before handing over to andreas i would once again point you to the disclaimer on page 2 of the presentation regarding forward looking statements and with this andreas please take it away andreas treichl good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome from my side letâ s quickly go through the presentation and we start on page four the net result for the first quarter this year was â 377 million which on a year to year basis vis ã vis the last quarter of 2018 is â 188 million lower of which â 118 million is due to taxes â 58 million worse in the other result which includes a â 24 million legal provision in croatia operating result is â 85 million lower than in the last quarter of 2018 and we re going to get in detail into it thatâ s on the nii and the commission income side and risk costs are better on a quarter to quarter performance the result is better than in the first quarter 2018 where we had â 336 million so an increase on a net profit basis of 12 and that s mainly due to substantially better operating results than in the first quarter of 2018 based on stronger nii a very strong trading fair value resolved and fee income up by 2 if you look at the ratios on page 5 you see vis ã vis the last quarter 2018 the net interest income slightly lower and the margin going down from 233 to 218 that s basically due to a relatively strong expansion of the balance sheet in the first quarter you look at the operating results that i said before up 11 vis ã vis the last quarter and the cost income ratio for the first quarter 2019 is 63 so quite a bit better than in the first quarter of 2018 risk cost nothing much to mention and the return on tangible equity is at 12 5 so slightly better than in the first quarter of 2018 where it was 12 if you go to page 6 you see again a strong growth on the lending side with â 3 6 billion in loans to banks but â 2 6 billion net loans to customers up and the same on the deposit side â 3 5 billion of increase deposits in the group which brought our total balance sheet to â 243 billion if you look at page 7 loan to deposit ratio basically unchanged if you look at the npl ratio no major changes slight improvement again to 3 and again the same time an improvement of the npl coverage going to 74 5 the core tier 1 ratio in the first quarter 13 2 and more changes on the liquidity and deleverage side you look at the business environment in our region that basically across europe forecast for growth in 2019 and 2020 are being revised downwards not very different in our region but to a much lesser extent than in germany and other western european countries we still do expect in many of our countries that gdp growth in 2020 will be greater than in 2019 inflation is relatively stable domestic demand increases unemployment is coming down across the region and of course particularly in the czech republic and in hungary has an effect on personnel expenses other than that i think you see from the government s side whether we talk about the current account balance with the most notable exception of romania all countries are doing well and are basically improving vis ã vis last year and public debt is coming down in all our countries and we do expect in the czech republic relatively soon that it will be one of the few countries in europe where these debt to gdp ratio is below 30 on the interest rate side no changes other than yesterday another hike in the czech republic which in our view will be the last one but very good news for us for this year and very good news for our nii in the eurozone maastricht and slovakia no news and probably no news to be expected this year i have very little to be said about the foreign exchange side we would expect actually the czech crown to appreciate a little bit throughout the year given that growth rates are strong and the country is performing extremely well on page 12 you see our market share development which has been very positive particularly in austria we also gaining clients across the board we are increasing our client share in austria quite substantially part of that is of course also reflected in higher expenses but the income out of the higher market share is hopefully here to stay for long each if you look at the business performance overall on page 14 strong loan growth across the region and on page 15 also strong deposit growth across the region and that is reflected on page 16 our first quarter nii is at â 1 161 billion that s about â 80 million higher than in the first quarter of 2018 and if you compare it to the last quarter of 2018 where it s â 50 million lower half of that is due to the fact that we have in the first quarter two interest days less than in the last quarter that alone accounts for â 25 million then we have an adjustment an interest rate adjusts and accrual of â 4 million due to a consumer protection case and another â 6 million is ifrs 9 so say â 5 million sorry ifrs 16 so â 35 million are explained by those items if you look at the countries you have a rather diverging picture in the czech republic particularly due to the balance sheet expansion you have the net interest margin coming down whereas in most other countries like in hungary it s relatively flat and in romania due to the interbank rate hikes you see the margin actually going up on page 17 you see the result of that so on a quarter to quarter basis pretty nice performance of the operating income in the first quarter of 2019 not so nice on the operating expense side costs are at â 1160 billion of that quite a bit can be explained simply through an increase in personnel costs personnel costs in the first quarter of 2019 were about â 17 million higher than in the first quarter which is mainly almost entirely due to increases in wages notably in most of the central and eastern european countries although personnel have been kept flat and actually we negotiated pretty well know the average salary increases in the country if you look at the cost income ratio it s usually the worst of the year in the first quarter which is also due to the fact that we booked the deposit insurances with very few exceptions almost entirely in the first quarter but it s better than in the first quarter of 2018 so overall the ratio this year should be better than last year and you can look at the ratios like we added in the countries and with that i will pass on to willie who will continue on page 20 with the risk picture of erste group willibald cernko yes thank you just a few remarks from my side talking about pages 20 21 or 22 i ve been looking at the current development this is characterized by a calculation of a healthy asset quality and volumes up further down by â 200 million at the level of â 4 7 billion npl ratio is below 3 to be expected to go further down this comes predominantly from a low level of npl inflows and will be benefiting from recoveries looking at the npl coverage as already mentioned it s going up to 74 5 so we see as in a very positive territory with that i want to leave the floor to gerot gernot mittendorfer good morning from my side i continue on page 26 and page 26 as already mentioned a loan to deposit ratio is at 91 4 so a little bit lower than at the year end but stable at this point in time 27 you see the continuation of the loan growth performing loans up 7 2 on a year on year basis and accompanying reduction of the non performing loans of 14 2 to a stock of â 4 7 billion performing loans now at â 150 7 we continue on page 28 liquidity situation of the group lcr and liquidity buffers the usual picture that you could see over the last couple of quarters no change there and a continuation of the excellent liquidity position of the group page 31 is showing you the maturity profile of our issuances we were active already this year and issuing in the beginning of march â 500 million 81 and non core 6 5 years and we are almost feeling the 1 5 81 bucket by this issuance and in addition in april we placed senior preferred â 500 million at 45 basis points and had an outstanding interest from investors and a really very granular and big orderbook page 32 gives you an overview on the mpe resolution strategy of the group we are planning to issue non preferred senior already in 2019 and here you have the details about the austrian resolution group and the resolution strategy and on page 33 we come to the capital position we saw a growth in credit risk weighted assets partially by a regulatory one offs and the ifrs 16 effects of â 1 2 billion the rest driven by business effects the capital ratios don t include the first quarter net profit but anyway we are at 13 2 fully loaded and here you see as well comfortable capital position with this i hand over to andreas for the outlook 2019 andreas treichl thank you we still look very positively at the year 2019 we believe that in our region according to all the forecasts whether they were in houses out of house growth in our region will be better than in other places in europe we see a lot of signs also that the effects of brexit will be well however and whenever it happens will be minor in our region actually partially positive some of the english car manufacturers have just decided to move practically all their production into our region of course the superior economic growth has its effect on the labor market we see that in some of our countries i felt you might have read in the paper that prague yesterday was declared the city with the lowest unemployment rate worldwide that of course has an effect on wages but our personnel departments actually have worked very well we re able to retain the best people without paying above market and actually we negotiated agreements that were below the market so in principle i think 2019 should still be a pretty good year for the group in terms of economic performance of the region that s why we continue to target a return on tangible equity of above 11 for 2019 and we can reconfirm for this year that we expect revenues to grow faster than costs and that is based on our expectation that loan growth again will be around 5 or even higher on the group level risk cost as you have seen were absent in the first quarter it s a bit too early for us at that point in time to revise our expectation for the year we might do that with the half year results if we feel more comfortable that the very positive trend of the first quarter continues that being said thanks very much for listening and we re now ready to take any questions you might have question and answer session operator we will now take our first question from anna marshall of goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open anna marshall good morning thank you for the presentation have a couple of questions please my first one is on the costs specifically could you please provide a little bit more color on your expectations for the rest of the year in terms of year in year dynamics for the quarters particularly as part of the growth in q1 as i understand was driven by regulatory charges which are front loaded into q1 my second question is on your digital strategy particularly now that you have an income in board member focused on the area do you have any updates and also any comments on george s performance so far would be appreciated anything quantitative thank you gernot mittendorfer yes on the cost side as already mentioned we see the wages growing at the 2 5 to 3 this is a similar situation as we have had in the first quarter we had some regulatory increases in the first quarter and on top of that due to the 200 anniversary we are having a marketing campaign that started already and kicked off already in january so there we have a little bit higher expenses as well coming from this there should be a normalization of the cost base going forward second question isâ andreas treichl okay is that okay on the first question or do you want more just juice beef anna marshall yes i was kind of trying to understand if this 5 year over year seen in q1 if there is any scope for that to moderate sounds like there could be some but just wanted to be sure gernot mittendorfer yes i mean it will be â weâ ll be moderating going forward it will not be 5 full year cost increase anna marshall okay clear andreas treichl okay okay so on george we are now active in austria czech republic slovakia and since october last year also in romania we presently have a â 4 7 million registered users we plan the next rollout hopefully at the end of the year already or early 2020 in croatia and in hungary the active user growth is about 2 7 month on month login growth is 13 monthly average users on the george app which is the fastest growing part of it is 38 we presently have around 13 million payments a month and the growth rate there is 6 4 month on month and so the payment volumes presently on a monthly basis is about â 6 5 billion those numbers should continue should maybe even continue to grow on the present configuration but of course once we add the remaining two countries that should give us another and another pretty strong push i think it s pretty clear that we have developed a leading position on digital banking in a different in different categories from country to country i think so austria weâ re clearly the leading brand with 1 7 million users in the czech republic we have 1 6 million users their competition is quite a bit stronger and in romania we re just starting with close to a half million users presently so i think that it should grow nicely during the next years it helps us to also gain new clients particularly that were particularly strong in austria and is now starting also very strongly in romania we ve done a couple of other very nice things on that front part of that is also reflected in higher advertising expenses two weeks ago we were the first bank in austria and the czech republic to offer the apple pay which brought us close to 60 000 users within the first two days so moving very quickly we re quite happy about it okay anna marshall okay thank you i think you re right operator we will take our next question from amandeep singh of deutsche bank please go ahead your line is open amandeep singh hi good morning thank you for taking my questions i have a couple of questions please on czech republic first czech bmis are coming in weaker the last few months now do you see any signs of impact of this on the business so far even czech national bank reduced its growth expectations yesterday and my second question would be how has the business changed in romania in the sense you must have seen some impact in 1q because of uncertainty and now that there is some clarity involving do you see any changes happening and how do you see this evolve over the year thank you gernot mittendorfer so the czech side the program the economy is facing is the shortage of qualified labor and so this is impacting the economy and this is limiting the growth rates there so we will see a little bit lower growth and the national bank has confirmed it but nonetheless business is quite okay what we have seen is in the first quarter a reduction on the mortgage lending but this was due to the measures introduced by the national bank on the 1st of november and there we have seen some increased activity ahead of the introduction of the measurements and as a result of that and in the next quarter as we expected a lower production number going forward it should stabilize and should not have a negative impact throughout the year andreas treichl so we are quite hopeful in the czech republic that brexit might have a positive effect with most of the czechs being kicked out of the u k they hopefully will come back home and ease the pressure on the labor market with regards to romania we have a pretty painful story at the end of last year with the attempt to introduce high levies on some of the industries including banking the outcome of that is quite positive because it s substantially very substantially less painful than we thought it would be but what remains is a relatively bad taste on the political environment in romania situation if you look at the pure numbers isn t that bad in the debt to gdp ratio in romania is to very favorably growth rates are okay but the more you look into the details the more you basically on a comparative basis see the difference between the economic development in a country like the czech republic or slovakia where growth rates might be somewhat lower but the structure of growth is substantially healthier than in romania where it s mainly consumption led and that you can see very easily if you just look at the current account deficit in the country that s again widening and is a sign of the relative weakness of the romanian industry which is not based on a weakness of the industry its health is actually relatively strong but you can see it on all corners of the country that the infrastructure development in romania continues to lag behind that of other countries in the region whether it s croatia hungary slovakia or the czech republic in all those countries infrastructure in all aspects is developing rapidly and romania continues to fall behind and if you listen first to the talks of romanian politicians now they have the eu presidency it doesn t make you feel a lot more comfortable quite frankly so we re doing fine we think it s relatively i think the bank is doing fine we re gaining pace base rate is improving its competitive position in the country and the bank will do fine whether the country will catch up with the star performers in central and eastern europe thatâ s a big question mark in our mind still amandeep singh okay thank you operator our next question comes from giulia miotto of morgan stanley please go ahead your line is open giulia miotto yes hi good morning a couple of questions from me as well please the first one so i want to go back to the czech republic but this time on interest rates are you starting to see any pressure on interest rates deposits at all and what would be your estimated impact for that for the most recent hike so that s my first question and then and secondly banking taxes so romania i mean now we know the impact czech republic hopefully at least from what we understand shouldn t happen is there any other geography that what is your or what you would expect any changes on this front and then and actually finally one last point on fees fees keep growing and it s especially payments less so asset management and could you please tell us what s driving this and what s the outlook here thank you gernot mittendorfer on the interest rate in the czech republic yes i mean might be now this time where banks sink and about forwarding something off the increase to the customers what you see is still pressure on the mortgage rates and mortgage margins deposit side did not move until now now we got 200 basis points repo rates that might be the starting point for that saving pays off again on the texas on the fee side basically you have slightly increase fee income which should continue and as you probably know that we have now lower fees on the current account but improving fees on the investment products and particularly for ceska sporitelna also insurance fees are increasing so we would expect a positive trend of the fee income in the czech republic during the coming quarters on the tax side i think it s rather unlikely that we will see the introduction of sector taxation in the czech republic given the fact that the countries under no pressure to do that because it s â so itâ s basically of a populist call on part of the czech they the socialist party which is very weak in the czech republic and with very populistic arguments i think what the country would like to see is higher investments there is i think some concern and i think some justified concern on part of the government as it tends to the communication sector in the czech republic where fees are relatively high there are continued discussions on the very high dividend payments of the banks to the parent companies those are issues where we are ready to talk and assist but basically i think the economic performance and the performance of the government presently is so strong that â i think the fear of that whatever taxation would be put on the banks or insurance companies all it would do is would make products and services more expensive for the people and so i guess the likelihood that that will happen is a very very low giulia miotto thank you operator our next question today comes from johannes thormann of hsbc please go ahead your line is open johannes thormann good morning everybody iâ m thormann from hsbc two questions please first of all regarding your net interest income interest income you mentioned to czech rate hike do you expect the same translation affect that most of the benefits feed through to your nii or do you expect that the czech customer behavior thatâ s change and you see less of the benefits there and secondly for the still existing leases of provisions do you see any signs in any of your customer sectors or client groups where you already see deterioration of asset quality or is it all currently on green light thank you gernot mittendorfer the net interest income as i was mentioning already we are discussing what to do now definitely it will not have a 100 translation as to last net interest â the last rate hikes but what you could see in the first quarter now we had the effects of last year s rate hikes in so itâ s definitely a positive but it will you cannot add another 20 million to our net interest income from this andreas treichl that has nothing to do with customer behavior that has to do with our behavior johannes thormann okay gernot mittendorfer okay when it comes to the asset quality currently we do not see any worsening throughout the various business segments but as the geographies looking at the npl ratios as it is already and also shown including croatia now weâ re in all of our countries and in all of our geographies we have presence in this year and we see in all geographies and across our business segments room for further improvement so currently no signs for any worsening johannes thormann thank you operator our next question comes from gabor kemeny of autonomous research please go ahead your line is open gabor kemeny hello i like to follow up on czech nii please you mentioned the negative alm contribution in czech here are you referring key to a lower returns from the treasury bonds and if yes shall we assume that this is going to be recurring and if you could also quantify the impact please and regarding the rate hike impact what is your current utilization of the cmb repos roughly and have you changed your utilization with the recent rate hikes gernot mittendorfer well weâ ve started last year ready in the first half to fully utilize the repos we were investing heavily as well in last year because we were underinvested in the czech republic hence we were using every opportunity and location to buy some duration at levels that we could see in the market right now you have seen in the first quarter a little bit of reduction on the longer end so there we were a little bit soft in our investment activities but as you could see on our net interest margin and the growth on interest bearing assets this effect is mostly due to the utilization of czech repos moving out the funds from overnight and a question on alm who mentioned on alm something i didn t get that weather who mentioned something on alm gabor kemeny it was in your presentation on page 15 gernot mittendorfer okay well the thing is that we are paying internally from the alm a certain rate to the retail for overnight deposits and this is a calculation of short term and long term average of short term and long term rates and due to the fact that this was growing quite significantly the short end the transfer pricing is increasing and this is then slowly reflecting in the alm as i was mentioning that we were underinvested and rebuilt that in the last year and in the first quarter we were a little bit slower given that market the environment so this is then leading to a negative alm results gabor kemeny okay and can you remind us roughly how much does cmb repos are you utilizing these days what your link and what youâ re utilizing gernot mittendorfer i think it s a high single digit billion figure in euros gabor kemeny okay and was it similar last year gernot mittendorfer it was lower last year in the first quarter because we increase that in the second and third quarter gabor kemeny understood thank you operator our next question comes from hadrien de belle of kbw please go ahead hadrien de belle good morning thanks for this call i have a follow up question in czech here i was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on what s happening in the consumer finance market and if some of the margin pressure or the lower nii we saw in q1 was already some sort of pricing pressure we see in the segment and your expectations going forward and the second question of have is on fee is you mentioned lower securities fees in austria it s growing 2 year on year what does that mean in terms of your aspiration to get to 2 billion fees maybe this year that would require quite a bit of an acceleration so just have a bit of comment or flavor on that would be useful thank you gernot mittendorfer so on the fee side andreas is working hard all over the summer i can confirm that and on the consumer finance market in the czech republic yes we are seeing market participant once special market participant with rather active in reducing the prices and this is putting a pressure on the market at the moment volumes are good and that people are taking consumer loans so i hope that this is just a moments and short period of time where we see increased competition because other than that the demand would â underlying demand would be healthy so on the fee side yes i mean the growth rate in the first quarter is too low for the 2 billion but as you can see we are not that far away and itâ s not out of reach hadrien de belle okay gernot mittendorfer but i think it will require some effort in the remaining three quarters i agree but i am not giving up on that goal yet hadrien de belle okay thank you gernot mittendorfer iâ m going to beat them to that goal operator our next question comes from riccardo rovere of mediobanca please go ahead riccardo rovere good morning good morning to everybody three four questions if i may the first one is on funding and i noticed that the total amount of securities issued from the liability side has gone down in the quarter this is not maybe a surprise given the deposit will continue to outpace loan growth now when i look at the slide where you present all the values maturities expiring in the next few years so shall i assume that that you might be in the position not to need all those issuances and more in the short term is it the amount of securities issue that we see in the balance sheet today more to remain more or less stable over the next few quarters this is the first question the second question i had is on the â i donâ t see in your outlook mentioned the 55 cost income target i was wondering whether this still stands third question i have is on the risk weighted assets if you see any headwinds in the coming quarters now that you have accounting for ifrs 16 or maybe could you have any impacts from prima or more than any kind of more update anything like that and very final question i like to be â iâ m curious to know with regard to george if i remember well you mentioned maybe 4 6 million activate or registered users is that possible to have an idea out of these number how many are new clients for erste banking in all the banks for that group level in the various countries where you have to rolled out george gernot mittendorfer okay iâ ll start with the funding question yes total funding was going down a little bit this year because we didn t have to replace everything as you ve seen we were focusing on 81 and we were issuing one additional senior benchmark because we didn t issue anything since 2013 as far as i remember and we wanted to have a reference point in the market in anticipation of senior non preferred issuances the next thing that you can expect from us going forward is mortgage bonds and senior non preferred is as i ve mentioned given slide on the resolution that we have added and that necessities that we see on issuance is i think you will see a stable issuance activity from the group similar to what a little bit lower probably in this year but similar in the amount going forward and this should in the next couple of years cover maturities that we are having the overall stable i mean from the prices you could see and the prices what weâ ve achieved i think there was some concern that our funding costs will dramatically increase once we are issuing everything and fulfilling the annual targets i think with this we could mitigate some of the concerns and proof that we will not be impacted too much overall i think volume should be pretty stable depending on the eligibility of various other balance sheet items that might be a chance that it goes down in the overall size then i cover risk weighted assets question as well we are expecting relief in the next couple of quarters so the most negative impact that we are expecting is included in q1 and there will not be additional negative impact as far as we can see it from today on the cost income ratio good question we never put the 55 in writing so we don t do that this year either but it still remains our target on the george question we had last year across the group in those countries in which george has been introduced 250 000 new clients you can assume that 90 of them are entirely due to george new clients so if you calculate that into our total user base of 4 7 million you can say about 5 of them are new clients riccardo rovere if i could just one thing 250 letâ s say 90 of 250 000 new clients in how much time if i may andreas treichl last year it doesn t include the first quarter of 2019 in one year riccardo rovere okay in one year all right now is that continues like that basically you will be building up a brand new bank letâ s say in two three year if that goes ahead like that then we can debates the profitability but customer wise itâ s like buying a brand new bank is that the fair assumption to such statement andreas treichl it s a very sympathetic assumption you can basically put it that way the good thing is that the number of non clients that join us because of george is increasing and it still doesn t include as is the number of last year romania hungary croatia and serbia so there is more more bees in that as we will â weâ ve introduced george last late last year in romania and we plan to introduce them late this year or early next year in the remaining countries riccardo rovere and then i ll stop i promise from a managerial perspective does the management of erste see george as a valid alternative of the traditional m a from your work and i would say but i would prefer to hear it from you andreas treichl yes yes yes riccardo rovere yes yes yes cannot be clear on that andreas treichl itâ s not an alternative to traditional m a itâ s definitely our preferred solution vis ã vis traditional m a operator our next question will come from alan webborn of societe generale please go ahead your line is open alan webborn hi good morning thanks for the call a couple of small points and one or two questions what was the 24 million negative in the other income in croatia in the first quarter secondly in the austrian business in your own austrian business the costs when q1 were quite high in the first quarter how much of that comes down to the sort of 200th anniversary market costs because thatâ s quite a high number and also in romania in the q in the first quarter costs also look high i wonder if thatâ s related the road out of george so if you could answer those three that would be great more specifically on the your own bank in austria in the first quarter you had a 10 roe we haven t seen such a low number for quite a long time and i wondered what you feel about the performance of that business i mean see the flat nii isnâ t really moving and also see that the costs were quite high so could you give us a better view as to how that business has been a consistently strong performer over the last number of quarters what we should be thinking about that going forward and then one last question on staff numbers i can see in one or two geographies thatâ s a very slight reduction in staff numbers over the beginning of the year elsewhere youâ re actually adding staff and in those sort of this precise digital route that youâ re taking we are well on the sort of the way to more than half a way to achieving what was the two year program in terms of digitalization do we get to a point where your ability to reduce ftes becomes more obvious i mean there are some banks in eastern europe that are seeing quite significant reductions in ftes as a result of digitalization weâ re not really seeing as i said iâ d ask through at the moment when do you think thatâ s going to happen thank you gernot mittendorfer weâ ll start with the 24 million in croatia this is legal an old legal cases that we were winning in the first instance and losing in the second instance and half is substance half is interest and cost so we were because we had a negative decision we had to reflect it in the quarter we appeal it we think that we are going finally we are going to win but if you have a second quote instance decision in house you need to reflect it in your earnings so the cost situation in austria yes it s not brilliant in the first quarter additional marketing cost is a low million number andreas treichl i would say itâ s a one off don t say we re celebrating our 200th anniversary this year we ve added a marketing campaign for that that is causing all in all will be up to 9 million this year we introduced apple pay in the first quarter with a major advertising campaign and we have added personnel in austria on the it side again we would have like to do with in other countries particularly also on the georgia front office side and on ai but some of the people that we wanted to get and not a small number but 80 of that wanted to have their working place in vienna and not in a bratislava or prague which we would have preferred which would also have been cheaper for us from a taxation point of view but the numbers are really relatively read relatively low but i agree we have in the ce region we have small personnel reductions in all countries but serbia and the only country where you see a very slight increase is in austria i prefer to say that this will develop and you see anything like that and that will of course working very hard on being able to transform the back offices on a digital basis a lot of that has been achieved already during the past month we made big steps forward but it correct you don t really see on the expense side yet but that is one of the main targets and goals of the management this year and the years after so weâ re working on it and weâ re very positive that we will achieve it and you can rest assured that the cost income ratio of the remaining quarters this year will be quite a bit better than the first quarter and also if you look at austria at the end the year the cost performance for the full year in austria will be substantially better than what you ve seen in the first quarter alan webborn okay thatâ s clear thank you very much operator we will take our next question from mate nemes of ubs please go ahead your line is open mate nemes yes good morning thank you for your representation i have two more questions left firstly on cost of risk it seems like an asset quality remains still a very healthy very strong at this point based on the year to date trends would you expect to be closer to the lower end of your 10 to 20 basis point guidance range for year and then also related to that if you could give us the gross number for cost of risk or for provisioning so without the write backs that would be helpful and secondly a follow up on expenses i know there is significantly step up in depreciation and amortization about 20 million year on year is also clearly upward pressure and personal expenses across the region so if you could perhaps elaborate a little bit more what can do in the next few quarters to contain and perhaps partly offset this pressure that would be helpful thank you gernot mittendorfer so the 20 million additional depreciation 16 out of that is ifrs 16 so this is just a sheet from other administrative costs to depreciation so thatâ s not new normal run rate as already mentioned i mean underlying we are seeing a personnel cost 2 5 to 3 and a little bit elevated marketing expenses vis ã vis last year it will be flattening vis ã vis last yearâ s quarters because we are usually having the highest marketing spending in q4 and we don t usually don t have such a high marketing spend in q1 as we are having this year so the base effect will have dampening impact going forward on the cost side and yes so the cost risk questionâ willibald cernko yes when it comes to cost of risk as already letâ s say outlined by andreas there is room for a positive deviation to be at the lower end of our outlook it wouldnâ t be a surprise to me and when it comes to the releases this is solely coming from cooperate mate nemes okay thank you very much operator our next question comes from simon nellis of citi please go ahead your line is open simon nellis hi thanks iâ d have a question on the romanian bank and a related question on romanian margin iâ m assuming that your 20 million bank tax charge assumption is based on getting some kind of the discount price if you grow your loan book a certain level or if you restrict your margins in romania as you could just confirm that andreas treichl no itâ s not the case simon nellis no itâ s not the case andreas treichl this is not the case so this is the upper end of the romanian bank tax charge might be below that simon nellis thank you so it could be below that if you â can you just remind us how you can produce that you have to grow your loan book i think by 8 i guess itâ s not by this line andreas treichl yes simon nellis would you try to do that andreas treichl weâ re not planning to reduce our margins to achieve a tax reduction because the tax payment is a one time the margin is forever simon nellis and loan growth andreas treichl loan growth we will see how the economy is developing and demand is developing we are not going aggressively out just because thereâ s a tax incentive simon nellis so the margin gain that you achieved is about sustainable and it will continue can it go up further actually the margin in romania gernot mittendorfer i mean i think right now pretty stable central bank did not indicated they are changing something weâ ll see how their market develops going forward andreas treichl and you can raise definitely assure that weâ re not going to grow our loan book because of a tax incentives and donâ t ask us to qualify that legislation that you can reduce a tax if you grow your volume it speaks for itself simon nellis yes okay thanks very much operator we will take our next question from stefan maxian of rcb please go ahead your line is open stefan maxian hello thank you two questions remaining actually one could you share your expectations regarding the fee impact from the restriction on cross border sepa payment which will become effective i think in fourth quarter this year and second now with psd2 now becoming reality and the sand boxes or the trials now open i think since march do you already have a better view on the impact on your revenues or on your business or would you change anything based on that thank you andreas treichl i can tell you sort of on the psd2 side it has zero impact so far and i think you will see the impact only then when you have really full oversight of transactions third party transactions that can be done on yours or somebody elseâ s platform which really doesnâ t work yet for the fledge but it will and quite frankly this is where we see with george as a platform that we have the competitive advantage vis ã vis most of our competitors as it is an incredibly attractive platform to utilize for third party bank accounts and do the transactions from one platform so basically when it s fully fledged we see that as a strong positive for us whatâ s the second question on sepa stefan maxian yes on this restriction for cross border fees andreas treichl what the impact on the p l will be stefan maxian right andreas treichl i donâ t know i got to get back to you i really â i donâ t know iâ ll look into that in detail weâ ll write you something on that stefan maxian all right thank you operator it appears we have no further questions at this time mr treichl i would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks andreas treichl well thank you very much for listening him thanks very much for interest in our group and your questions next round will be on july 31st with the half year results if we donâ t see or hear each other again until then enjoy may june and july all the best
the calendar is modest with the big reports all hitting last week investors will never have more current information on the economy the fed corporate earnings and various risks than they do right now it is difficult to guess what the punditry will do when given an open slate we should be asking should we fear a market top last week recap in last weekâ s installment of wtwa i took note of the avalanche of relevant data suggesting that it was time for some synthesis and analysis i didnâ t expect any help from the pundits who analyzed piecemeal as expected i hope that readers did better by using my suggested framework more about that below the story in one chart i always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart this week i am featuring jill mislinski who packs a lot of relevant information into the weekly chart without sacrificing clarity in another quiet week the market was virtually unchanged the trading range was only 1 8 the volatility seemed higher to

and how to react the calendar after last weekâ s data avalanche this weekâ s calendar is light inflation data will get attention especially given discussion that the fed is considering alternative measures i am interested in the jolts report as insight into labor market structure but most simply use this to gauge employment growth briefing com has a good u s economic calendar for the week here are the main u s releases next weekâ s theme last weekâ s calendar included the key reports leaving us with a much lighter schedule this week while earnings reports continue we have the key trends in mind fresh data feature ppi and cpi since these are expected to increase more than last weekâ s pce measure there could be some talk about the fed switching to an alternative measure i havenâ t seen a good synthesis of what we learned in the fragmented methods of financial media we should be asking should investors fear a market top last week i provided a guide for data interpretation it was not as much fun as the buffett bingo card for todayâ s meeting but should have a bigger payoff for readers remember that we were suggesting a baseline of real gdp growth of 2 â 2 5 enough to support earnings and a continuing stock rally the key questions are below with the result in italics the fomc meeting is very unlikely to reflect a change in policy so be alert if it does i donâ t regard modest changes to current policy as very important but the market is reacting aggressively in such cases here is a cheat sheet based upon recent fedspeak personal income and march and spending february are key elements of the economic picture weâ re still catching up from the shutdown income is especially important pce price index the core rate is the fed favorite so it is more important than other inflation indicators if it remains low the fed will remain on hold ism manufacturing index is important as a near contemporaneous read on an important sector it has some leading qualities for employment ism non manufacturing covers a wider range of businesses but has a shorter history the historical relationships are a key to any inference about overall economic strength beware of dramatic reactions to a small change employment is a fundamental element in measuring economic strength we crave this information so much that we are often uncritical about the data i am equally interested in the adp report and the â officialâ non farm payroll report they use different methods and each contributes value corporate earnings should support the current economic picture both in continued earnings beats and outlook housing data are less interesting case shiller prices are older and on a subset of the data pending sales are interesting but less significant than the new home sales data construction spending is also of lesser importance does the evidence support the base case of 2 â 2 5 growth that should be the question for each report â not whether there is a small change from the prior month i have a few additional conclusions in todayâ s final thought quant corner and risk analysis i have a rule for my investment clients think first about your risk only then should you

here is a key quotation many traders focus on their results their p l and never make the process changes that could lead to sustained results a great deal of writings in the area of trading psychology emphasize the changes that traders should make not actual techniques traders could employ to make those changes brett made a dynamic presentation at the naaim conference drawing rave reviews his comments inspired my own ideas about how investors become preoccupied with the short term implications of a trade the immediate dollar result is not the best criterion despite its popularity what is a good trade stock ideas chuck carnevale continues his sector by sector quest for attractively valued stocks each post in this series provides both interesting ideas and a lesson in how to perform solid

gold represents a challenge for the value investor as lyn alden schwartzer writes gold stocks meaning companies that mine gold or finance gold production can potentially throw a wrench in a value investorâ s plan gold is an esoteric commodity a substance that has ideal characteristics to store wealth but is endlessly debated on how to value it it produces no cash flows which throws out discounted cash flow analysis as a valuation tool the bulk of it is not consumed by industry so the immediate balance between supply and demand does not dictate price since most gold ever mined is still stored and can be sold and yet in order to value gold stocks as businesses we need to be able to determine if gold is grossly overvalued deeply undervalued or somewhere in the middle hence the

excellent post by fattailed prepay mortgage or invest leverage negative bonds this is a frequent question and the post provides a good analysis with easy to understand examples i doubt that most think of their mortgage as a negative bond and your risk calculation depends critically on the real estate cycle gil weinreichâ s series on seeking alpha sa for fas is ostensibly geared to financial advisors the analysis is much broader than that most diy investors will find it quite useful this week i especially enjoyed the post the problem of too much cash he summarizes the analysis of jim

results on his buy list he wrote the takeaway is clear all the doomsayers of a few months ago were overstating the case the economy is still expanding and markets are responding i have a continuing concern about investors who are taken in by stories designed to scare them witless tm oldprof euphemism these seem to fall into a few key groups economic data that are â deceleratingâ or â rolling over â no economic series remains indefinitely at a peak a â wave styleâ series is quite normal if the economy was overly â juicedâ after the tax cuts it is no surprise to see it return to trend newly minted recession experts i am absolutely dismayed at the seeking alpha editorâ s pick on a story that has been on the front page for days â how the next recession will occur it is a typical exercise in taking a pop economics concern â debt â and saying that it will all end badly the author has no credentials in recession forecasting and no evidence for the causal reasoning the leading email source of market commentary has been on this same theme for six weeks the debt is a fact the implications are conjecture i often express concern about government debt when i see it as a near term threat to investors you will hear about it meanwhile beware of those who are just selling something fed bashers they are back in action as usual some think that rates are too high and others see them as too low the nuanced argument is that the fed missed the chance to raise rates earlier and now it is stuck i am absolutely amazed at the number of people who claim to know more than all the fed economists a little peer review would go a long way the consequence is that many intelligent investors are being punished in their professions they are rewarded for acquiring knowledge in the financial world they are punished since the â knowledgeâ is bogus a final example from dr brettâ s naaim presentation illustrating incorrect focus he gave the example of a trader worried about a long term matter like debt disaster and also an investor glued to the trading screen that doesnâ t work either if you want to find long term gains without guessing short term timing reach out to us we have

pappas chris christopher pappas thank you alex and thank you all for joining our first quarter 2019 earnings call building on our 2018 performance we started 2019 with continued strength in customer demand and good execution by our teams in the first quarter during the quarter we delivered solid organic growth expanded our customer base and executed on a key acquisition in the center of the plate category with the acquisition of bassian farms we generated strong year over year top line and gross profit growth despite challenging weather in our west coast and midwest regions i d like to thank our entire team for delivering the chefs warehouse premier product and experience to our customers as we continue to make progress on technology and market expansion initiatives a few highlights from the first quarter include 5 6 organic growth in net sales specialty sales were up 6 6 organically over the prior year which was driven by unique customer growth of approximately 6 2 placement growth of 5 2 and specialty case growth of 5 2 organic pounds growth in center of the plate was 3 1 gross profit margins increased approximately 30 basis points gross margin in the specialty category declined 39 basis points as compared to the first quarter of 2018 while gross margins in the center of the plate category increased 106 basis points year over year in addition gross profit dollars grew approximately 13 4 versus prior year first quarter in a moment jim will provide more details on margin in a few moments as we announced in february we are excited to add bassian farms to our growing northern california market and the chefs warehouse family of companies bassian will focus on delivering high quality natural sustainable local and antibiotic free center of the plate products to our growing customer base in the bay area and beyond we have already begun combining production operations and over time will realize further operational and distribution synergies throughout integration we welcome lee dan and the entire bassian team to the chefs warehouse and we look forward to growing our northern california market together we continued to progress on multiple systems and operational process improvements during the first quarter we initiated the process of converting our texas operations to our erp platform this coincides with our move into our new dallas facility we expect to complete this conversion this summer our philadelphia erp conversion is scheduled to begin later in 2019 with our west coast sites coming on in early 2020 customer adoption of our e commerce platform continues to grow as of april we estimate sales on e commerce and mobile platform represented more than 11 of total organic revenue and 15 of all specialty orders placed online additionally more customers are using the mobile platform to communicate orders as approximately 18 of online revenue came via mobile during the quarter we continued our roll out of truck scanning across our distribution centers our chicago distribution center was live in the first quarter and new york went live in april while early in the process initial results have shown year over year reduction in errors and credits on a per cases basis our northwest ohio and florida markets will follow with implementations during the remainder of 19 in addition smartdrive camera technology has been installed in our new york fleet during the first quarter with several other markets underway in the second quarter we continue to make progress on several facility expansion projects as of mid april 2019 we ve begun operations out of our new distribution center in dallas texas the 85 000 square foot of freezer cooler and dry space provides us with considerable capacity to grow this important new market additionally during the first quarter we signed the lease for our new facility in los angeles and expect to begin design and buildout in the second half of 2019 in the near term we are focused on finalizing site selection for a new facility to support our growth in florida once again i would like to thank all of our teams for delivering a strong first quarter and helping to build the chefs warehouse platform we have today the continued dedication in serving our customers allows us to focus on continuous improvement in the near term and at the same time make the investments required to deliver the long term growth with that i ll turn it over to jim to discuss more detailed financial information jim james leddy thank you chris and good afternoon everyone our net sales for the quarter ended march 29th 2019 increased approximately 12 1 to 357 million from 318 6 million in the first quarter of 2018 the increase in net sales was the result of organic growth of approximately 5 6 as well as the contribution of sales from acquisitions which added approximately 6 5 to sales growth for the quarter net inflation was 1 3 in the first quarter consisting of 1 4 inflation in our specialty category and inflation of 1 3 in our center of the plate category versus the prior year quarter gross profit increased 13 4 to 90 2 million for the first quarter of 2019 versus 79 5 million for the first quarter of 2018 gross profit margins increased approximately 30 basis points to 25 3 while inflation and deflation by protein category was a mixed bag in the first quarter continued enhancement in our pricing and sourcing practices in our center of the plate category contributed to first quarter margin improvement year over year specialty margin while remaining at a historically strong level was impacted by significant inflation on larger categories such as cheese and baking ingredients as well as some impact from product mix total operating expense increased approximately 13 9 to 84 million for the first quarter of 2019 from 73 8 million for the first quarter of 2018 on an adjusted basis as a percentage of net sales operating expenses were 21 6 for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 21 2 for the prior year first quarter the majority of the year over year increase in operating expense as a percentage of revenue is attributed to facility related costs associated with our investment in the texas market and other acquisitions completed over the past year as well as timing of certain corporate related costs versus the same period in 2018 this was partially offset by lower distribution and selling related costs as a percent of revenue our operating spend in the quarter was in line with our expectations it is important to note that in the context of the year over year comparison the first quarter of 2018 generated 130 basis points of operating leverage as measured by a percentage of revenue as compared to the first quarter of 2017 in terms of our outlook for the remainder of 2019 the comparisons to 2018 on a quarterly basis ease significantly this is reflected in our updated full year guidance released earlier today in addition our updated full year guidance shows improvement in our expected gross profit dollar growth to adjusted operating spend growth as compared to our full year 2018 results as well as to our original 2019 guidance given in january operating income for the first quarter of 2019 was 6 2 million compared to 5 7 million for the first quarter of 2018 the increase in operating income was driven primarily by increased gross profit offset in part by higher operating expenses as a percentage of net sales operating income was 1 8 in both the first quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2018 interest expense decreased to 4 6 million versus 5 million for the prior year first quarter due primarily to lower effective interest rates charged on the company s outstanding debt and the conversion of to equity of the 36 75 million of convertible notes during the third quarter of 2018 income tax expense was 0 4 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 0 2 million for the first quarter of 2018 the increase in income tax expense is primarily due to higher pre tax income versus the prior year first quarter our gaap income was 1 1 million or 0 04 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2019 compared to net income of 0 5 million or 0 02 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018 on a non gaap basis adjusted ebitda was 13 2 million for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 12 1 million for the prior year first quarter adjusted net income was 1 4 million or 0 05 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2019 compared to adjusted net income of 0 8 million or 0 03 per diluted share for the prior year first quarter we ended the first quarter of 2019 with 17 3 million in cash in march of 2019 moody s upgraded chefs corporate credit rating from b2 to b1 as of the end of the first quarter of 2019 net debt to adjusted ebitda was 3 4 times turning to our guidance for 2019 based on the current trends in the business we are updating our financial guidance to be as follows we estimate that net sales for the full year of 2019 will be in the range of 1 56 billion to 1 61 billion gross profit to be between 399 million and 409 million net income to be between 28 4 million and 31 4 million gaap net income per diluted share to be between 0 95 and 1 05 adjusted ebitda to be between 89 million and 93 million and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between 0 97 and 1 07 this guidance is based on an effective tax rate of approximately 27 5 for 2019 our full year estimated diluted share count is approximately 30 million shares thank you and at this point we will open it up to questions operator question and answer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of renato basanta with barclays please proceed with your question renato basanta good evening and congrats on the nice quarter so first can you just talk about the cadence of case growth in the quarter i think you referenced some january weather issues on your last call and obviously march is an important month but you also i think had some easy compares in march so i guess first if you could talk about the cadence of sales in 1q what you re seeing quarter to date and any regional color that will be helpful james leddy sure so i think on the q4 call we talked about other than the polar vortex at that point we hadn t really seen anything out of the ordinary in terms of our case and volume growth i think the quarter was pretty steady across the quarter march was a very strong month for us we had pockets of weather the significant rains on the west coast you had the government shutdown for a little bit in the mid atlantic region and then you had the polar vortex in the midwest other than that other than those kind of pockets of weather we had pretty steady as expected volume growth throughout the quarter renato basanta and quarter to date james leddy you re talking about april in q2 well i mean other than the easter shift we haven t really seen anything quarter to date that we would call out as compared to q1 renato basanta and then just curious on the gross margin your specialty grocers were down about 40 bps and then center of the plate about 100 bps i know you mentioned some of the inflation i think in cheese and baking but can you just talk a little bit more about some of the drivers there going forward you have some harder comparisons coming up in center of the plate so wondering if you would expect a reversal there and then maybe an improvement in specialty any color on the puts and takes there would be helpful james leddy sure so just in terms of the quarter and the 39 basis points about half of that was product mix primarily from acquisitions acquisition wrap so the business that we re building in texas has lower than our average across our total business in specialty margins and so that s providing a little bit of a year over year drag and the rest of it was as i said we had pretty broad based inflation across our categories in specialty but in some of our larger categories like cheese and baking and pastry ingredients we saw 4 plus percent inflation in the quarter and that s really the balance of it but what i would add is is that when we look at our specialty gross profit margin in q1 it s at our historically strong levels from an overall level perspective so we re pretty happy with the performance in the quarter renato basanta and then just on the corporate expenses timing can you just give us some context there maybe help quantify the impact and if we should expect a commensurate reversal in 2q james leddy sure so in terms of corporate it s mainly driven by the corporate related benefits that we recorded in q1 of 2018 and we are comping against that we did have a little bit of carryover of elevated medical expenses in q1 this past q1 of 2019 not at the level we saw in q4 but still higher than our historical level this is driven by claims the variable portion of it our fixed medical costs on a per employee basis are still fine it s really just the claims related but it s mainly driven by the comp portion of that that was about half of the 40 basis points of operating leverage impact the other half was as mentioned in the prepared remarks facility related expenses mainly related to the acquisitions that we completed after q1 of 2018 renato basanta okay great thanks for the color and best of luck operator our next question comes from the line of chris mandeville with jefferies please proceed with your question christopher mandeville hey good afternoon just a follow up on renato s question with regards to inflation jim can you just review i think you mentioned that there was a bit of a mixed bag on center of plate what exactly transpired there specifically within the categories and i suppose pork has been quite topical of late so what are you seeing within that protein and how do you think about that going forward james leddy yes in general it was a mixed bag we had inflation in certain higher end and preamble cuts like sirloins and tenderloin and even the higher end choice and some of those categories started out deflationary but became more and more inflationary as we progressed through the quarter and then on the low middle and lower end meats we actually experienced a lot of deflation so it was generally a mixed bag as i mentioned in our prepared comments some opportunistic and improved buying practices as well as improved margin management and we are able to take advantage of some of that deflation and drive higher margins we also had the benefit of a good comp this quarter in terms of pork i don t have any specific thoughts on it right now christopher mandeville and then correct me if i m wrong here but i believe fuel costs were a fairly sizable headwind to you in 2018 so how did that look year on year in q1 and how are you thinking about that for the remainder of the year james leddy yes i mean it started out looking really good but if you ve paid attention to diesel prices they stayed elevated when you look at it year over year it was roughly flattish the real benefit we would see would be in the second half of the year if fuel prices were to stay at the level that we were seeing earlier in the quarter but the recent rise kind of mitigated that obviously we don t know what s going to happen in the second half of the year but if there is any benefit from the year over year comp on fuel it will happen in the second half of the year christopher mandeville and presumably that would be upside to how you re calling out guidance today is that fair james leddy i mean our guidance is a range that would cover i think that level unless there was a cratering in gas prices and i don t know if anybody sees that on the radar right now christopher mandeville and then just the last one for me as it relates to the guidance range or excuse me the guidance raise is that just purely a function of the bassian farms acquisition or are there any maybe minor offsets or minor incremental items to consider within the call it 3 million ebitda increase james leddy yes sure thanks for the question it s the change is almost purely bassian and then think about our guidance following q1 being effectively unchanged from our original guidance so our original guidance we guided to year over year on a full year basis improvement in both gross profit margin and operating leverage as a percent of revenue as well as the gross profit dollar to adjusted opex gap that has improved with the addition of bassian but going back to my remarks q1 is really comp driven from an operating leverage perspective and we were still on we are still on track to meet our full year guidance and obviously it s improved slightly with the addition of bassian operator our next question comes from the line of andrew wolf with loop capital markets please proceed with your question andrew wolf just want to talk on the gross margin on the center of the plate so it sounds like there was a little bit of opportunistic profit in there but just wanted to ask you sort of systematically in terms of systems processes just better management practices how much more is there to go on this business i m not talking about 100 basis points a quarter but just is there something systematically that s going to continue to make this business reach a profitability level that s where you want it to get or is it approaching that christopher pappas i think andy when we got into center of the plate a few years back we said it was a new business for us and it was about building the team building the information the transparency that we had at chefs into the protein business and we will get better every year and i think that we re starting to see that i still think we have plenty of room to keep improving so we had a shift in management john pappas actually is overseeing the protein division and the changes that they ve been making they keep getting better and better so we are a specialty protein company and we re starting to i d say act and execute more introducing a lot of new product lines and more in line to how chefs sees the business with lots of choices lots of antibiotic hormone free lots of low chol lots of grass fed so we keep we re making it more and more of a branded company more like the rest specialty of cw so i m extremely optimistic of where protein is going and i think the best years are coming management team continues to get better we had great people and i think they re just getting better and better and i m really excited about that division andrew wolf that sounds good chris is there a scale advantage at this point or is buying and things like that local due to sort of the specialty nature of it or is there some scale advantage of it christopher pappas i think the scale always helps so i think as we scale there will be a benefit but the big scale of specialty is in the new markets where we re small it s really the logistics is killing everybody in the trucking business today we saw a big increase it s kind of stabilized but really the big advantage of getting bigger is you get better freight rates and it adds up to a lot of money so i think as we continue to scale we will get the tailwind in the freight cost andrew wolf great that s kind of a good segue the other question i wanted to ask that s kind of in the similar vein is if you could maybe give us just a thumbnail sketch of where you re at in texas i know it s not that big yet but i know you ve talked about it in the past as potentially one of your bigger markets in sometime in the as you grow continue to grow the business so as you put in this new facility what can you go from what to what and sort of what s your kind of where do you think the business gets in a few years christopher pappas yes again i think texas is top three every time i fly over texas i realize how big it is and lots of hungry people that like to eat out so it s a perfect market for chefs warehouse so we just actually moved into our new facility about a week ago i believe so i d say we re in the first inning and for this year it s again it s building it s hiring sales reps it s adding product it s a lot of training so we ll continue to grow i think we ll have a good growth here but really we re looking at texas at every year it gets better and year four and year five it starts to really start to throw off the kind of returns that we re expecting so it s a long term investment i m optimistic just like i was in san francisco and chicago a great tuck in would do wonders so we d love to see us find a good tuck in or two now that we have the space but at the same time we keep marching we got a great management team and we are hiring signs everywhere chefs is hiring in texas so we re hunting for talent and we continue to put great people into the organization and i think next year yes again next year is a big step forward and then year three four and five we ll start to reap the benefits andrew wolf just a last question maybe for jim and i might have missed this but what kind of inflation expectations you have baked into the guidance for the year into the sales guidance james leddy yes sure so we haven t really changed our outlook so i think in when we reported in february moderate inflation on a total level and that s kind of 0 to 2 on the specialty side and then flattish to 1 averaging out to kind of flat to 1 on a full year basis kind of very similar to what we saw in 2018 and so if you look at our top line guidance as it s been updated it implies kind of 9 to 12 top line growth you think about that as organic growth of 5 to 7 with about a point of inflation in there and then m a with the inclusion of bassian on a prorated basis and then the wrap from last year s acquisition is about 4 to 5 so that kind of breaks down the top line guidance as it s been updated andrew wolf great so it s neutral year over year if you had your druthers where would you like to see inflation about 2 to 3 like where s the sweet spot where it adds to your sales but doesn t squeeze your margins too much christopher pappas i think 1 5 to 3 as long as it s not all at once and with some volatility is the perfect environment for us to operate in operator our next question comes from the line of kelly bania with bmo please proceed with your question kelly bania good evening thanks for taking my questions just a couple more on bassian farms are you planning for or expecting any attrition there and just with a couple of months now just maybe how you re feeling about how that s going and how it s being integrated into the chefs family and then you talked about some synergies maybe just expand a little bit on what areas you see those are in and the timing on those christopher pappas sure great questions yes so bassian was a great addition to chefs it was a perfect cultural fit so we gained a great well trained sales force and owners that are experts and actually were in line with chefs as marketers and brand builders so the only attrition i mean it s more of a growth story kelly over the next five years we expect the combination to have great growth of chefs bassian in the short term maybe where there is some overlap the customer may choose to bring some another purveyor in just to have more competition it usually happens but we are really optimistic that we can grow their customers and they can help grow ours with some of the lines that we ve acquired with the acquisition that are perfect fits to our customer base so let s say maybe first six months getting into the shoe and getting the shoe to feel comfortable and then i really expect it to be a growth story james leddy and kelly just as we mentioned in the prepared remarks we ve already combined production operations so we re getting a limited amount of synergies already there and then as chris mentioned it is an eventual fold in we are being thoughtful about that process to make sure it goes very smooth and we re looking at their footprint in distribution and facility within the context of our overall san francisco platform and so that work is being done now so there are future operational and distribution synergies down the road we re just being very thoughtful in about it and it will come in over the next year or two kelly bania and maybe just another one on texas just can you help us think about how the expenses maybe ramped there as you start to hire and grow out that new facility christopher pappas sure kelly bania yes that would be helpful christopher pappas sure yes it s built into the guidance so 19 is an investment year so as i tell the rest of the team we re carrying texas on our back right now but the potential is so enormous so i think we ve built in adding a tremendous amount of skus new salespeople managers that s all built into the guidance for 2019 and i think 2020 as we start to get the rewards in 2021 22 we expect it to really accelerate james leddy and kelly i ll just add to that i talked about earlier that about half of that 40 basis points of deleverage was texas and acquisition related facility costs and that s really just a straight line impact of having it in q1 whereas the bulk of the revenue growth comes in the higher revenue quarters that follow so that s basically the impact year over year kelly bania and then maybe just the produce category you had talked about maybe kind of starting a little bit with that i think in the new york city market maybe just if you ve learned anything with that or what you think that category could bring to chefs christopher pappas yes again as i look at chefs i think i ve laid it out the way chefs looks say five years from now i think fresh has at least 0 5 billion of increased sales i think comes from the fresh division it s a division that we are just touching on now and we re seeing the acceptance from our customers and the opportunity really to leverage the sales force and the relationships and the truck routes we think that the customers want chefs to carry fresh so we re really excited about what we re going to do organically in our growth and what we could also in fold in and acquisitions that could really add to the whole chefs we call it the chefs family of offerings so we re really excited about fresh kelly bania perfect and last one from me you talked about the truck scanning and the reduction in errors and credits and so i was curious if you think about as you roll these out to the remaining markets what s the impact of that is that a gross margin or an expense benefit and is that a meaningful thing that you can maybe size up for us james leddy yes i mean it s very early innings this is a we ve been scanning onto the truck for a year or so now and now we re just rolling out the off truck scanning we are seeing some benefit the benefits will come in both opex and gross profit so we ll have better inventory management as a result of reduced errors and returns and things like that and it ll help us better manage the overall warehouse expense in terms of whether it s overtime or hour so it just contributes to overall efficiency i don t know whether we want to still roll this out and get a better sense of what we re learning from it and there s a lot of training involved so we re not in a place where we re going to be quantifying it but we may down the road christopher pappas yes it s kind of a must do kelly so when as i tour our operating units and talk to customers and salespeople and i think part of the reason you see such strong organic growth for us is really our service levels and it s something that you can t measure but i think that one of the reasons that we do have such great growth besides our great people and our incredible products is that our service levels our service levels are better than our competitors and that s what i m hearing from customers and i think the scanning process and getting an order delivered correctly really goes a long way i think you can t underestimate customer satisfaction how they reward you is they give you more business so as we add categories and ask customers for more categorial growth it s hard to ask them when you re not delivering what they want already so it s just an important factor to get the delivery to take the order correctly use the better technology for taking the orders and online helps with that and then actually picking and delivering it correctly goes a long way for asking a customer for increased category growth which is really key to our growth so we re very excited about it operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question and answer session and i would like to turn the call back to mr chris pappas for closing remarks christopher pappas yes well we thank everybody for joining us on our first quarter call here in the rainy northeast we are looking forward to the sun starting come out this spring and a great second quarter and hopefully everybody joins us for our second quarter call so thank you very much for joining and have a great evening operator this concludes today s conference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your participation
world leaders met in beijing between april 26 and 27 to fine tune china s us 5 trillion belt and road initiative bri president donald trump was absent but president vladimir putin of russias along with roughly 40 other head of states attended the bri is china s president xi jingping s creative global vision it will link ports and roads to china it will be a very important source of investment for capital formation and industrial development in the developing countries therefore whereas the previous government gravely erred by not pursuing the port development the present government made a wise decision to sign the memorandum of understanding signaling jamaica s intention to participate in the bri china invested us 11 9 billion in 55 countries in africa asia latin america and the caribbean countries these bri participants see china as a new source of investment that is vitally needed to promote economic growth american objections meanwhile us vice president mike pence told a recent meeting of the asia pacific economic cooperation in papua new guinea that china is trying to saddle the world with debt pence said that the countries of the world ought to stick with america who doesn t coerce or compromise your independence headlines delivered to your inbox sign up for the gleaner s morning and evening newsletters mike pence clearly forgot about america s ongoing coercive attitude towards venezuela neither did he remember jamaica s own experience in the 1970s nicaragua now and what about haiti libya syria iraq and yugoslavia who lost their sovereignty by force didn t he remember that there is no doubt that china s rapid advances are causing anxiety in america this was the subject of a phone call president donald trump reportedly made to former president jimmy carter to complain about how china is getting ahead of america emma hurts of national public radio reports that jimmy carter told donald trump that china is ahead because america wasted money on wars and military spending do you want to know why china is ahead it is because the united states is the most warlike nation in the history of the world carter said in remarks made public jimmy carter told donald trump that china has not wasted a single penny on war and that s why they are ahead of us america in almost every way that s why we are not able to economically compete according to jimmy carter the us wasted roughly us 3 trillion on military spending while china has put her money into infrastructure development and i think the difference is if you take us 3 trillion and put it in american infrastructure you d probably have us 2 trillion left over america would have high speed rail railroad bridges that aren t collapsing properly maintained and our education system would be as good as that of say south korea or hong kong he said economic success because of its economic success china was able to pull 800 million people out of poverty in 30 years this is a great story in human history world bank president jim yong kim said but the story does not stop there since 1979 because of china s mighty economic clout it is the leading engine of growth in the world economy this has given china the ability to peacefully compete with america while simultaneously flexing its financial muscle through projects such as the bri the chinese dragon is on the rise the chinese currency the yuan is now a global currency that many countries use instead of the american dollar in international trade kimberley amado writes that china wants its currency the yuan to replace the us dollar as the world s global currency the signs are already there on how this can be achieved since china is the world s largest purchaser of petroleum products it has pushed aside the petro dollar and introduced the petro yuan as the new benchmark against which all purchased oil prices are to be determined technological edge china s 5000mh microchip for self driving motor cars is the world s first another major first is the development of high speed 5g communications also china recently landed a space probe on the dark side of the moon the side that is not visible to earth this is another truly remarkable scientific and technological feat another first in history it is because president donald trump fears that america is losing its technological edge that there is an increasing tendency to use politico military means in the form of national security threats against both america s allies and purported foes china and russia carl von clausewitz a 19th century german military strategist was clearly right when he said that war is a continuation of economics what we are seeing today is a world in a virtual state of war as superpowers america russia and china jostle for a competitive edge but as the two major titans the soaring eagle america and the leaping dragon china battle for supremacy let s remember that the american failures that jimmy carter outlined to president trump are not just a republican thing president barack obama allocated us 2 trillion to build new smart nuclear bombs but in my opinion did not allocate huge sums towards research and development in new technologies meanwhile america is lagging behind many countries in science education mathematics and technology and unless america can get her act together and seriously invest in public education science technology and research and development it may well continue to lose its once dominant global technological edge that is just the bitta truth norris mcdonald is an economic journalist social

to cut or not to cut that is the question after years of coasting along on the back of outrageous fortune reserve bank princeling philip lowe as another famous plutocrat once observed may just be forced tomorrow to take up arms against a sea of economic troubles right now there s an even money bet as to whether the reserve bank will shave another quarter of a percentage point off the official cash rate ultimately the debate is not about if but when if it doesn t move tomorrow it most likely will be next month and there will be at least two within the next few months two unrelated factors will be weighing on the governor s mind at tomorrow s meeting one is the upcoming election and the potential political fallout from a rate cut in the final days of the campaign the other potentially more significant factor is that the us federal reserve chief jerome powell may just have delivered mr lowe some breathing space by thumbing his nose last week at us president donald trump s demands to cut american interest rates the american central bank boss has put our currency under pressure on friday the aussie battler spent most of the day below us70c a situation that would have delighted the boffins down at the reserve bank for their entire focus now will be on undercutting the currency in an effort to boost growth and inflation and the best way to do that is through slashing rates the case for a cut the long grinding downturn in our housing market finally has begun to bite last week both the anz banking group and nab highlighted a small but significant uptick in the number of homeowners having trouble repaying mortgages according to anz s numbers almost 5 per cent of households now have slipped into what s known as negative equity that s when you owe more on the house than it s worth it s a situation that can become serious if unemployment rises not only do defaulting borrowers lose their home they still end up with debt and losses start mounting in the banking sector ultimately putting the economy further under strain that s also starting to impact spending on friday the federal chamber of automotive industries reported an 8 1 per cent drop in new car sales in april compared with a year earlier while motorcycle holdings told the stock exchange the motorcycle market had shrunk 14 6 per cent in the first three months this year add in an inflation reading of zero in the march quarter and a plunge in annual gdp to just 2 3 per cent and there are some pretty compelling reasons to cut interest rates right now waiting for unemployment to deteriorate as some suggest the rba should would be leaving things too late would a rate cut stop the housing rout it may slow the decline but it won t halt it demand is being crimped by the sudden introduction of responsible lending on the other side of the equation supply is about to explode with several hundred thousand new apartments about to hit the market those two factors combined can only mean one thing further falls in housing prices so why bother with a rate cut nab s interim boss phil chronican last week forcefully argued there was little to gain from another cut to interest rates monetary policy has a lot of potency when it s at high levels when they are at low levels it just doesn t have the same effect he said he s right in some respects so long as you are looking purely at internal dynamics but his comments largely missed the point the real objective behind a rate cut is to sink the aussie dollar in decades past before deregulation a weak currency was considered political suicide oppositions would seize upon a devaluation as a sign of economic mismanagement not any longer governments and central banks for decades have been engaged in a race to the bottom when it comes to currency a weak currency boosts an economy by making exports cheaper and therefore more competitive and imports more expensive which puts domestic industry on a stronger footing why it will work this time australian competitiveness was belted out of the park by the mining boom when our currency soared to almost us1 10 a large swathe of our industry particularly manufacturing was hollowed out it was the final nail in the car industry s coffin the great recession made things even worse the developed world led by the united states fought a currency war that took no prisoners we were among the casualties between them the us japan and europe printed vast sums of cash the idea being that increasing the amount of cash lowered their currency s value the us alone pumped an extra us3 5 trillion into the economy interest rates compared between australia and the usa abc news alistair kroie australia was too small to take part in that war but we can now not through printing money but simply by cutting rates for most of our history australian interest rates have been higher than the united states and other developed nations because we needed imported cash to fund our development but that s all changed as the graph above shows last year us official rates climbed well above ours and it looks as though this will be no fleeting phenomenon america s economy is rebounding and we re slowing on friday night the us jobs numbers were way better than expected it s not so much the level of our rates that matters on that point mr chronican is correct but the gap between our interest rates and america s will have a big impact on the currency it s what s known as the spread the wider it gets in america s favour the weaker our dollar will become that s because investment funds looking for a decent return will scarper offshore in search of higher yields as our dollar sinks inflation in theory at least should escalate and wages should follow helping australian households overcome the mountain of mortgage debt now weighing them down a weaker dollar will deliver bigger returns from our mineral and agricultural exports plus it will ramp up our service industries education and tourism among them the us central bank had planned to continue boosting interest rates through 2019 but last year s stock market plunge in the lead up to christmas which sent mr trump apoplectic kyboshed that idea if the us had continued hiking rates we may have been able to merely sit on our hands for a few more years as america widened the interest rate gap for us that s no longer an option the us now is likely to sit still the onus now is on philip lowe to don the armour

it s the same old story the dogs of demonization bark while the new silk road caravan advances the belt and road initiative bri according to a projection by anglo australian mining and metals giant bhp billiton will generate as much as us 1 3 trillion in myriad projects up to 2023 only a decade after its official launch by chinese president xi jinping in both astana now nur sultan and jakarta it s easy to forget that the bri a massive connectivity project both geo strategic and geo economic now in effect all across the eurasian landmass as well as straddling the south china sea plus the indian ocean all the way to east africa is less than six years old and projected to last until 2049 as i previously reported the bri is now configured as the authentic international community 2 0 much more representative than the group of twenty not to mention the group of eight even before the start of the belt and road forum in beijing last week 126 states and territories had signed bri cooperation agreements after the forum there are 131 plus switzerland soon to join the bri is also engaged with no fewer than 29 international organizations including the world bank considering only projects already being implemented the world bank estimates that bri nations have reduced shipping times by up to 3 2 and trade costs by up to 2 8 the bri forum s key takeaway was beijing s ability to execute a masterful geopolitical sun tzu maneuver realizing that for the scheme to proceed more smoothly it would have to address key questions about debt sustainability anti corruption consultative processes plus emphasize bottom up negotiations scores of nations across the global south as well as some aspiring to developed world status have adopted the chinese investment and development model over financing from washington or brussels for three very simple reasons no strings attached no one size fits all straitjacket and no interference in their internal affairs that s the case in bri projects focused on the group of china plus central and european nations now called 17 1 greece just joined the bri has been on a roll implementing the china europe land sea express line from athens to hamburg via skopje and belgrade with a branch out to the mediterranean port of bar in montenegro just across from italy and then to budapest the ultimate crossroads in eastern europe and all the way north via the czech republic to hamburg additionally the land sea express line will connect to the pan european corridor linking bari bar belgrade and timisoara in romania new silk roads stretch from china to europe southeast asia and africa image cfr asean goes bri the association of southeast asian nations is arguably the crucial front to ensure the bri s further success side by side with the china pakistan economic corridor cpec and all 10 asean leaders attended the bri forum beijing s strategic outlook involves the positioning of thailand as asean s key transportation hub thus it needs to complete the 12 billion multi phase 873 kilometer high speed rail line linking central and northeastern thailand to the rail line being built from kunming to vientiane which is due to be completed in 2021 this is the flagship project of the bri s china indochina peninsula economic corridor connecting southern china with mainland southeast asia all the way to singapore at the recent bri forum china thailand and laos signed a memorandum of understanding on building the stretch between nong khai and vientiane now comes the hard slog of renegotiating the terms for building the 607km stretch from bangkok to nong khai on the thai side of the mekong malaysia managed to renegotiate the budget and route of its eastern coast rail link plus china and myanmar are renegotiating the 3 6 billion myitsone dam project at least nine of no fewer than 23 projects part of the china myanmar economic corridor are rolling including a special economic zone sez in kyauk phyu in the west the kyauk phyu kunming railway and three border cooperation zones in kachin and shan states myanmar is absolutely key for china to enjoy strategic access to the indian ocean elsewhere in maritime southeast asia the 6 billion 150km jakarta bandung high speed rail is a goer despite facing accusations of non transparency by indonesia s investment coordination board still the joko widowo administration s second term is bound to be involved in no less than 91 billion worth of bri related projects to develop four different economic corridors one thing is common to these multiple bri negotiation fronts the lost in translation syndrome imagine terms and contracts mired in a maze of cross references and a trilingual swamp mandarin english and then thai lao indonesian etc not to mention the clash between local red tape and the ultra streamlined chinese infrastructure building juggernaut perfected to the millimeter for the past few decades still beijing is learning the key lessons admitting it s essential to renegotiate key terms amend deals pay close attention to local input and essentially allow more transparency chinese contractors must employ more local workers encourage technology transfer and be very aware of negative environmental impacts there are suggestions that an overseas bri arbitration court for instance in neutral geneva could be set up in addition to bri courts in shenzhen and xian in the interests of more transparency all aboard for a silk road journey photo pepe escobar hop on a camel and join the band wang huiyao founder of the center for china and globalization think tank in beijing correctly argues that the bri has become a plan for global development the kind the world has been sorely lacking since the financial crisis of 2008 that was certainly the intent even during the long gestation period before the birth of the bri in 2013 the chinese system works like this the top of the pyramid issues a guideline or a plan and then the subsequent layers of the pyramid come up with their own implementation strategies tweaking the process non stop it s always a variant of little helmsman deng xiaoping s famous dictum crossing the river while feeling the stones as it stands there s no evidence the us government will be engaged with the bri not to mention try to shape it to bring about a more multipolar asia as my friend parag khanna argues the bri itself along with other mechanisms such as the eurasian economic union is already configuring a multipolar asia and no one across eurasia apart from hindutva fanatics and japanese supremacists is buying the pentagon narrative of china as an existential threat it s quite enlightening to pay attention to the words of former hong kong governor tung chee hwa who seems to display more wisdom in his 80s now as chairman of the chinese consultative people s congress than when he was lodged in government house and then we could travel in time to the ancient silk road which as a trade and cultural exchange network between east and west was a de facto prototype of globalization we ll find out that among the non stop ancient silk road travelers and merchants messengers pilgrims there was also a motley crew of jugglers acrobats musicians dancers and actors centuries later history strikes again and we are all actors now in a massive global development caravan
indexing and passive investment have little to learn from macro at the start of april the bloomberg barclay bond index included mainland chinese bonds for the first time a macro strategist could have explained how china s yield had been falling since reaching above 4 in may june 2018 was near 3 40 in late march and why it might not go down much further the government was committed to supporting the economy new stimulus was being delivered and more were in the pipeline the had appreciated by nearly 2 5 in q1 it was the third strongest currency behind the 6 2 and 2 6 the dollar had approached a level cny6 70 where chinese officials had seemed to draw a line signals are indirect and can change not only were yields low but the currency was strong it was not an attractive time to be adding mainland bonds to the portfolio still the index is the index if one second guesses the index that makes it a different kind of fund actively managed funds cost more than passive funds though fixed income managers are more likely to beat their benchmark than equity managers in a more immediate sense macro does not seem to matter either the u s reported accelerated q1 to above three percent blowing away expectations and the meh the u s reported a a week later and a drop in the and again meh the eurozone reported better stronger than expected with italy emerging from the h2 18 recession it followed it up with a larger than expected rise in the did not get any traction and was near the lows for the week prior to the u s jobs report but let s not jettison macro too quickly equity analysts often talk about the market as a discounting mechanism to say that same thing slightly differently markets anticipate there was net demand for dollars ahead of the gdp report there was demand for dollars before the employment report it is as if the smart money bought the dollar effect before the cause strong economic data it is as if some of those who bought ahead of the news were happy to sell to those who thought the headlines justified a stronger dollar we suspect that divergence that has been the primary fuel of the dollar s rally has run its course for now u s growth is not quite as strong as it may look and the eurozone is not as weak the risk is on the upside for the european and pmi even in germany where the sector is still contracting the flash was at a five month high the uk is likely to report that accelerated to 0 5 in q1 from 0 2 in q4 18 which would lift the rate to 1 8 from 1 4 japan is the laggard it will not report until the middle of the month but it looks like it contracted household spending in march is expected to have slowed on a year over year basis for the second month here is part of the problem cash earnings are a falling year over year and march is likely to be the third consecutive decline the reserve banks of and meet the rbnz is more likely to cut rates that the rba the market has a little more than half the cut discounted the has fallen a little more than 5 since late march it came within a few hundredths of a penny from the flash crash low 0 6575 on january 3 along with other currencies it staged an upside reversal ahead of the weekend it was mostly a question of the broader u s dollar pullback but the market may be looking past the first cut if it is one and done there would be scope for the kiwi to trade higher the market appears to have discounted a little more than a 1 in 3 chance of second rate cut this year in this context what the rbnz says may be more important than what it does some will argue that the case for an rba rate cut is just as compelling but the market thinks otherwise the derivatives suggest around a 37 chance of a cut has been priced however speculators in the futures market have net short futures position 54k vs 11 5k yet the aussie had fallen about 3 1 since april 17 when it tested a two month high a little above 0 7200 it made a marginal new low since the flash crash in the knee jerk reaction to the jobs data 0 6985 before recovering to almost 0 7025 and closing again on above 0 7000 the previous floor as china returns from an extended may day holiday there will be several economic reports including might increase a little and slower growth in and a smaller contraction in may result in a wider surplus probably edged a little higher to 2 5 matching its highest level since the first quarter last year the deflationary scare in producer prices has subsided it might rise it 0 6 which would be the strongest this year the takeaway is that what appeared to have been a slowing of the chinese economy has been arrested brexit is about to enter a new phase the local elections results were stark of 8 400 council seats the tories lost almost 1335 considerably worse than expected labour cannot capitalize on the tory self immolation it lost 82 seats the lib dems were the big winner picking up 703 seats and the greens who are also pro europe gained 194 seats independents also did well the key to what happens next is the lesson that is taken from these results talks between the government and labour resume next week there is a small window of opportunity to strike a deal which would probably entail a softer exit than the kind envisioned by the likes of boris johnson or nigel farage talk suggests if a deal can be made it will be known by the end of next week if a deal cannot be worked out shortly the pressure on may to step down will build she led the party into losing its majority in the house of commons the withdrawal agreement her government

eventually replace libor finished last week at 2 50 the top of the fed funds target range powell said that the soft inflation was transitory this might not be as controversial as some made it seem april will be reported at the end of next week recall that the year over year pace was nearly halved from last june and july s 2 9 to 1 5 in february a 0 4 increase that is the median forecast in the bloomberg survey would lift the year over year back above 2 0 for the first time since last november it may not sound like much but a 0 1 rise in the core rate would be the first increase this year the mueller report was only one front on which president trump is being stymied moore is his fourth candidate to the federal reserve that was not defeated by democrats but by republicans a party that continues to support trump by an overwhelming majority the republicans are also threatening to reject trump s 2 trillion infrastructure initiative that is the subject of talks with the democrats north

84 bln of coupons that same as in q1 it will raise almost 29 bln of new cash recall that treasury is taking extraordinary but not unprecedented measures in lieu of the debt ceiling being lifted these measures are limited and it appears crunch time could be by the end of q3 china s trade negotiating team will be in washington in the coming days there have been some reports that president xi s calendar is making space for a meeting with trump next month which suggests an agreement is near leaks from china are rare raising the possibility that it was purposeful at the same time there is talk that an announcement of a meeting could take place by the end of the week ahead recent accounts indicate that the u s has softened its position on intellectual property rights in biologics and in cyber espionage a deal is an executive agreement which means that unlike nafta 2 0 it will not require senate approval the same holds for the current talks with europe and japan

they re not alone governments and lawmakers in turkey the u k india and elsewhere have been steadily eroding the bedrock idea that a central bank should be left alone to manage the economy based on evidence and data not political goals this is motivating numerous commentators to write farewell notes for the concept of central bank independence in the u s president donald trump reportedly still plans to nominate political allies to the federal reserve even after potential nominee herman cain withdrew in the face of stiff opposition in italy the government proposed seizing control of banca italia s approximately us 100 billion in gold reserves which it reportedly would use to fund spending plans and has threatened the central bank s independence in other ways i agree with their concern and find government interference deeply troubling that s because a large body of economic research makes it quite clear placing monetary policy into the hands of an independent central banker who bases decisions on evidence and data instead of populist ideals leads to lower inflation and greater economic stability key ingredients of a strong economy also read rbi isn t alone populist leaders around the world are squeezing central banks and as i know from research i ve done with a variety of colleagues political meddling comes with a hefty price tag while it is incredibly hard to build a sound central bank that is trusted by investors and citizens it is even harder to do so after its credibility has been corroded the promise of easy credit there s a reason politicians like to gain control over a central bank it s a powerful institution that literally supplies constituents with cheap money via lower interest rates creating jobs and boosting growth in the process at least in the short term to underscore the kind of weaponry central banks bring to bear economists and journalists use the term bazooka to describe their firepower and with populists taking power across the globe on promises of endless economic prosperity governments are tempted to use this bazooka to help meet them lowering interest rates is one such weapon another is the ability to essentially create money out of thin air even though technically central banks don t print cash this can help governments fill budget shortfalls and fund new spending programs presumably in the hope of more votes on election day economists call the ability to withstand such political pressures and steer the financial side of an economy in a consistent manner monetary credibility attempts to manipulate interest rates or to regain control over monetary policy for political gain is effectively undermining this credibility the price of political meddling a few historical examples show what can happen when a government meddles with a central bank in 1971 u s president richard nixon successfully pressured federal reserve chair arthur burns to lower interest rates which juiced up the economy and helped him win reelection the following year americans paid dearly for nixon s victory however as the low interest rates helped fuel double digit inflation throughout most of the 1970s and hurt the value of the u s dollar the fed s efforts to fight these rising prices with higher interest rates resulted in two recessions political interference in monetary policymaking can have even worse effects in countries that rely heavily on international investors to fund governments and the private sector hungary s decision to revoke its central bank s independence in 2011 prompted credit rating agencies to downgrade the country s debt to junk status this caused the currency to fall to record lows drove the economy into recession and pushed the country to the brink of default also read on top of everything else the rupee has to deal with the modi govt rbi clash in argentina almost a third of its citizens are in poverty thanks in part to out of control inflation a problem decades of central bank meddling largely caused and it doesn t take actual interference to have disastrous consequences in his attempt to mobilize popular pressure for lower interest rates president recep tayyip erdogan has repeatedly attacked the bank of turkey and called interest rates the mother of all evil although the bank has resisted bending to his will the turkish lira and the country s financial markets have been on a roller coaster ride causing economic turmoil credibility lost is hard to recover undoing the consequences of political meddling and restoring faith in a central bank and the country s currency often requires a lot of short term pain primarily this takes the guise of rising interest rates even if the economy is in trouble this is a sure recipe for recession that s what happened in the 1980s as then fed chair paul volcker tried to restore the bank s credibility and bring inflation under control the fed raised rates to a record 20 in the process pushing the u s economy into recession twice the bank of turkey has hiked interest rates to 24 in attempts to fend off further rounds of speculative attacks on the lira and hang on to its credibility the economy is suffering as a result and in argentina although the current government says it believes in central bank independence banco central de la república argentina continues to struggle with the legacy of rampant inflation with only sky high interest rates likely to put it in check more economic pain is likely the experiences of central and eastern europe after the fall of the berlin wall are further testimony of this long and often painful road to monetary credibility something today s populist movements might want to bear in mind put bluntly political meddling with central banks is an incredibly bad and dangerous

agriculture today is not working for the majority of americans it is not working economically for farmers it is not working for rural communities and it is not working for the environment but it is working for big agribusiness corporations that are extracting our rural resources for profit for far too long government farm policies have incentivized a get big or get out approach to agriculture this approach has consolidated the entire food system reducing farm net income and driving farmers off the land in droves as farms disappear so do the businesses jobs and communities they support moreover one in six american children still live in food insecure homes industrial agriculture has taken a toll on the environment and our rural communities have been left in a chronic state of economic decline and decay our mid size and small towns have been decimated local businesses were replaced with national chains many schools and hospitals shut down and good jobs left at an alarming rate the next generation of rural americans is finding better opportunities outside of the small towns where they grew up in fundamental change in america s agricultural and rural policies is no longer just an option it s an absolute necessity farmers foresters and ranchers steward rural landscapes which benefit all americans they provide us with essential resources such as food fiber building materials renewable energy clean water and habitat for biodiversity they also have an enormous potential to address climate change with the right support and policies we can have rural communities that are thriving economically and ecologically the following policies will drive a transition in our agricultural system away from a consolidated profit driven industrial model to one

regulations the meat and poultry industries launched a full scale attack to get gop lawmakers to pass appropriations riders to block usda from finalizing those farmer protections working together we will restore the agency that enforces antitrust laws in the meatpacking industry an agency that trump eliminated ensure farmers have the right to repair their own equipment in rural america today farmers can t even repair their own tractors or other equipment because of the greed of companies like john deere as noted in wired magazine farmers can t change engine settings can t retrofit old equipment with new features and can t modify their tractors to meet new environmental standards on their own without going through an authorized repair agent when we are in the white house we will

companies like monsanto change regulations to improve markets for family farms strengthen organic standards so behemoth agribusinesses cannot circumvent rules and cut out small producers who make investments in their communities and environment we must begin by reversing the erosion of standards in recent years according to the organic trade association the organic food market is now a 50 billion market and over the last five years the organic food business has grown 10 annually and makes up about 6 of the total food sold in america the trump administration has been working to rescind organic rules that organic farmers want those certification rules strengthen the sales pitch of organic products to consumers when we are in the white house we will undo this damage the organic food

allow meat slaughtered at a state inspected facility to be sold across state lines foreign meat that has equivalent inspection standards as our federal standards can be sold across state lines freely in the united states while state inspected beef cannot even when those state standards meet or exceed federal standards this puts domestic producers at a disadvantage we must level the playing field fair trade deals our current trade policies encourage overproduction and push low cost commodities on foreign countries effectively undercutting and destroying local agricultural systems while enriching multinational corporations our agricultural trade policies should not threaten the domestic food security of the u s or any of our trading partners classify food supply security as a national security issue we need trade policies that safeguard food security at home and around the globe over 800 million people worldwide are affected by undernourishment or food deprivation including millions of small farmers threatened by climate change volatile prices and unfair trade practices by 2050 food demand is expected to grow by 60 while at the same time the amount of arable land is estimated to shrink due to climate change urbanization and soil degradation we ve already seen how food insecurity and conflict are linked in ongoing famines in east africa south sudan and yemen when we are in the white house food supply security will be the core of our national security we need trade policies that safeguard food security at home and around the globe over 800 million

partnerships that do not drive down the prices paid to food producers and that instead protect farmers here and abroad enforce country of origin labeling so companies cannot import foreign meat for slaughter passing it off as american grown to undercut domestic producers unfair trade policy has let foreign countries overturn our country of origin labeling laws even though 90 of the american people support country of origin labeling we must respect the will of the people and allow them to know where their food is coming from ensure a fair price for family farmers independent family farms have been decimated by past and current farm policies in the pursuit of short run economic efficiency the food security of the nation still depends on farmers on family scale farms who are committed to being good stewards of the land and good citizens of their communities and nation enact supply management programs to prevent shortages and surpluses to ensure farmers make a living wage and ensure consumers receive a high quality stable and secure supply of agricultural goods re establish a national grain and feed reserve to help alleviate the need for government subsidies and ensure we have a food supply in case of extreme weather events as we saw with the most recent flooding in the midwest we can lose a huge amount of agricultural land and goods in a single weather event as we saw with the most recent flooding in the midwest we can lose a huge amount of agricultural land and goods in a single weather event reform agricultural subsidies so that more federal support goes to small and mid sized family farms rather than that support going disproportionately to a handful of the largest producers transition toward a parity system to guarantee farmers a living wage that means setting price floors and matching supply with demand so farmers are guaranteed the cost of production and family living expenses pass comprehensive disaster coverage and allocate payments to independent family farming operations provide relief to help prevent independent family farm bankruptcies which in areas like the midwest are at their highest level in a decade help beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers get fair access to land and resources when the average age of farmers is 58 and 95 of farmers are white we need to help new farmers transition on to the land and ensure farming is a viable profession to support their families when the average age of farmers is 58 and 95 of farmers are white we need to help new farmers transition on to the land and ensure farming is a viable profession to support their families strengthen oversight of foreign acquisitions of american farmland in order to prevent that farmland from being controlled by foreign governments and foreign corporations according to the new food economy the most recent figures from usda show that roughly 25 million acres about 2 of our national total of 930 000 000 acres are in foreign hands and the pace of investment seems to be picking up this is a national security issue and we must treat it like one according to the new food economy the most recent figures from usda show that roughly 25 million acres about 2 of our national total of 930 000 000 acres are in foreign hands and the pace of investment seems to be picking up invest in beginning farmers to purchase land and equipment for sustainable farming allocate government funding to purchase easements to ensure land stays in agriculture incentivize community ownership of farmland to allow more people to work the land and produce food for local consumers make government owned farmland available as incubator farms for beginning farmers incentivize programs including 4h extension programs or others to ensure diversity of age race gender ability and sexual orientation so we begin to eradicate systems and cultures that prevent fair access to agricultural land and opportunities in 2017 95 of all farmers accounted for were white with black farmers reporting ownership declining at ten times the rate it did for white farmers that s on top of black farmers losing 80 of their land between 1910 and 2007 in no small part due to systematic discrimination today only about 5 of black farmers reporting earning over 50 000 compared to 15 of white farmers 52 of american women farmers said they felt gender discrimination when we are in the white house we will eradicate discrimination in agricultural land and opportunities rebuild regional agricultural infrastructure past and current policies that support large corporate infrastructure have destroyed small and medium scale agricultural and food processing infrastructure in rural communities fund development of local independent processing aggregation and distribution facilities incentivize rural cooperative business models and utilities such as rural electric cooperatives food co ops and credit unions in 2009 of the 2 2 million total farms in this country 2 389 were farm co operatives what we know is that when employees have an ownership stake in their company they will be more productive and they will earn a better living policies to empower farmers foresters ranchers to address climate change and protect ecosystems combat climate change and invest in the working landscape our current food system accounts for 25 of all greenhouse gas emissions not only can we drastically reduce on farm emissions farmers have the potential to actually sequester 10 of all human caused emissions in the soil agriculture forestry and fishing are the industries most vulnerable to climate change we need to incentivize farming systems that help farmers both mitigate climate change and build resilience to its impacts pass comprehensive legislation to address climate change that includes a transition to regenerative independent family farming practices help farms of all sizes transition to sustainable agricultural practices that rebuild rural communities protect the climate and strengthen the environment provide grants technical assistance and debt relief to farmers to support their transition to more sustainable farming practices support a transition to more sustainable management of livestock systems that are ecologically sound improve soil health and sequester carbon in soil create financial mechanisms that compensate farmers for improving ecosystems establish a program to permanently set aside ecologically fragile farm and ranch land protect the environment for all rural residents we have strong federal laws in place but the current administration lacks the will to enforce them particularly on mega farms regulations should be scale appropriate and focus attention on the operations with largest impact farm practices should not infringe on the ability of other farmers and neighbors to carry out the normal activities of farming and rural lifestyles enforce the clean air and water acts for large factory farms and ensure all farmers have access to tools and resources to help them address pollution according to the epa inspector general the epa has spent over ten years and 15 million failing to develop a reliable method for measuring whether factory farms are complying with the clean air act and other regulations of dangerous air pollution industrial animal feeding operations and the millions of pounds of untreated waste they create are a major source of air pollution and driver of climate change we will end this weak oversight of factory farms and ensure every farmer has the resources to address all forms of

families and properties from chemical and biological pollution including pesticide and herbicide drift policies to foster investment to revitalize rural communities education we must prepare the next generation to rebuild rather than to abandon rural america we must guarantee a strong public education system from childcare up to college and jobs training programs for every child and young adult in

farmers immigration immigrants play critical role in america s agricultural sector and rural communities but many undocumented workers live in constant fear of deportation and lack basic human rights enact policies that allow immigrant workers who already live here to stay in this country that means long term visas and a pathway to citizenship protect farmworkers from trump s deportation machine

by joan swirsky it s only weeks away from the day in january last year when donald j trump ascended to the presidency and took his oath of office as the 45th president of the united states of america in only 12 months it s fair to say that he has already had an extraordinary presidency more bold courageous and revolutionary than any american president since the founding fathers almost two and a half centuries ago i use the adjectives spectacular and extraordinary not only to describe the sheer ebullience and optimism the president exhibits every day at his impossibly daunting job and in spite of the non stop vilification of the angry bitter jealous left but mostly because his accomplishments in both domestic and foreign affairs have been so stupendous for the american people haven t you been reading the papers and watching tv the pathetic never trumpers grouse if you had they insist you would have seen clearly that the president has had just about no accomplishments of course if i depended on the media whores at cbs nbc abc msnbc cnn and the washington post the new york times national public radio npr the list is long i would be forced to believe the avalanche of fake news which consistently fails to give even passing mention to the president s laudable achievements but one of the genius things candidate trump accomplished before he was elected and entered the oval office was identifying the colossal phoniness of the so called mainstream media jim hoft proprietor of gateway pundit reports that according to wikileaks at least 65 mainstream media reporters met and coordinated with top hillary clinton advisors during the 2016 presidential campaign below is only a tiny sampling of what a friend of mine calls partisan prostitutes all of these shills worked closely with the clinton campaign were invited to top elitist dinners with hillary campaign chairman john podesta and chief campaign strategist joel benenson and in every case were given an off the record agenda which was blatantly and fawningly pro hillary note significantly no fair and balanced fox news reporters made the list it wasn t only fake news that militated against candidate trump it was also the leftist polling companies that consistently reported fake numbers right up until 8 p m on election night but whaddaya know in spite of a massive coordinated blitz of negative reporting candidate trump s message resonated with the entire country which promptly awarded him the presidency embed from getty images forging ahead last may i wrote about the juggernaut and the jerks in which i described the formidable inroads the juggernaut president had made on behalf of america as opposed to the drumbeat of negative press he received from the jerks in the media three months later covering president trump s second quarter in office i wrote about the unstoppable trump train again cataloging how the chief executive was slashing the mountain of wasteful government spending getting rid of strangulating regulations establishing strong ties with foreign leaders and initiating measures designed to improve american lives forever now that the november 8th date has passed since donald j trump s historic upset election and president trump is approaching the one year date of his inauguration on january 20th 2018 it is fitting that i close out my assessment of his first year in office the super human factor there is a very good reason why president trump long before he ever contemplated a run for the presidency became a multi billionaire in the real estate industry and one of the most successful tv stars of the 20th century it is simply because he s smarter than most people definitely than most politicians and he has that x factor of charisma that is missing in most of the nearly eight billion people on earth brains and charisma in his case equal the ability to get big things accomplished combined with the charm to convince even his rivals that what they originally thought was a bad idea is in fact a good idea and this is not to omit president trump s ability to play the kind of hard ball that eclipses the ny yankees 27 world series championships case in point the president just proclaimed that jerusalem was the official capital of israel after just about every president since 1948 campaigned on this promise and never delivered most people know this instinctively since jews have lived in the holy land for over 3 000 years and jerusalem is mentioned in the bible over 600 times in dramatic contrast to the muslim s holy book the koran which mentions jerusalem not once following the president s pronouncement 128 of the corrupt tin pot dictators in the united nations condemned the declaration but unlike past presidents especially the poseur president barack obama who had a peculiar fetish for those anti semitic dictators president trump said really you don t want to vote with the country that supports you to the tune of billions of dollars every year okay it ll cost you hard ball and sure enough u n ambassador nikki haley immediately negotiated a 285 million cut in the amount of money the united states would contribute to the u n budget yes only a 3 5 cut but just watch the next vote and if it s again against america s wishes watch the next cut meanwhile within days the president of guatemala jimmy morales announced that he would move his country s embassy to jerusalem and shortly after deputy foreign minister of israel tzipi hotovely announced that at least 10 more countries joined the growing list of those who intend to move their embassies to jerusalem unprecedented numerous pundits and websites have been keeping close track of pres trump s first year accomplishments including the white house itself worldnetdaily com former house speaker newt gingrich david p goldman of pajamamedia com brietbart com writer katherine rodriguez david prentice of american thinker blogger don surber paul bedard of the washington examiner breitbart com bruce thornton of frontpagemag com professor ray schneider blogger jeff dunetz on and on i credit each and every one of them with helping me compile the following list of president trump s mind boggling first year accomplishments but because of space constraints it is only possible for me to mention a tiny percentage of the smashing successes the president has brought about since his inauguration believe me this is only the proverbial drop in the bucket economy in contrast to breitbart writer john nolte s description of mr obama s anti growth policies and anti free market rhetoric president trump he says has taken complete ownership of the american economy including the enactment of the massive tax cuts and jobs creation law which eliminates the obamacare mandate and provides incentives for corporations to repatriate trillions stashed overseas to avoid america s unnecessarily high tax rates and consumers to have greater choice in healthcare options a latino unemployment rate that is has hit a record low in the 45 year history of government tracking a black unemployment rate hitting a 17 year low after nearly two decades of double digit unemployment an unexpectedly high growth rate of 3 3 percent in the third quarter of 2017 with projections for the fourth quarter edging into the magic number of 4 percent the unemployment rate hitting a 17 year low the lowest since 2000 mortgage applications for new homes rise to a seven year high lowest gas prices in more than 12 years a boom in manufacturing jobs with 171 000 having been created under president trump in stark contrast to the 16 000 manufacturing jobs lost in the poseur president s final year and the manufacturing unemployment rate just 2 6 percent the lowest in history in addition a booming stock market with a gain of more than 4 trillion in wealth the dow over 24 000 and for the first time ever rising 5 000 points in one year and the s p and nasdaq setting all time highs a decrease in the u s debt by 101 billion dollars in his first five months the poseur president barack obama increased the u s debt by 771 billion dollars the president convinced companies such as ford chrysler and carrier air conditioners to manufacture and build plants in the united states and corning announced it was investing 500 million in new u s production creating 1 000 new jobs foxconn the world s largest contract electronics manufacturer which makes the iphone announced in july it was investing 10 billion in wisconsin to build a factory that will employ 3 000 workers directly and up to 22 000 workers indirectly according to ambrose evans pritchard international business editor of the london telegraph american companies have stashed trillions of dollars overseas in what amounts to the greatest cash reserve in the world and president trump as part of his tax reform is not bringing that money back to the u s potus reversed the dodd frank act financial regulation legislation in which regulators were given too much power and big banks were given special treatment refused his 400 000 a year salary as president took just one dollar and donated to the park service veterans affairs signed executive order for an apprentice program to train skilled works to fill six million open positions reduced white house payroll by 22 million domestic policy according to david prentice of the american thinker we ve experienced a miracle in our day that a lot of us thought we might never see again president trump is destroying ms 13 and other illegal immigrant gangs he has reset an agenda for space exploration by nasa exposed the national media for the leftist activism base it is exposed the democratic party as corrupt issueless and powerless exposed the fecklessness and fraud of the gop exposed the deep state to public view exposed the corruption of our bureaucracies by the obama administration in addition the president has rolled back the roadblocks to coal mining which cost the industry 81 million a year ended the ban on oil drilling in alaska s arctic national wildlife refuge anwr opening up more than a million acres to oil exploration which will create an unprecedented job boom and total energy independence for the u s approved the dakota access pipeline project and the construction of the keystone xl oil pipeline from canada which are expected to create more than 42 000 jobs and 2 billion in earnings rejected the paris climate accords which perpetuated the hoax of global warming saving the u s billions in money

introduction that life begins at conception according to writer katherine rodriquez food stamps under pres trump have been reduced to their lowest levels in seven years down in 46 of 50 states with 1 5 million fewer subscribers the trump administration reached a very substantial settlement in a class action lawsuit brought by more than 400 conservative groups illegally targeted by the poseur president s internal revenue service foreign policy bruce thornton of frontpagemag com notes that pres trump has begun to repair the damage to our international prestige wrought by the poseur president s one world naïve internationalism favored by progressives who want to diminish america s global clout in that regard potus has increased the sanctions on iran and refused to recertify obama s disastrous agreement with the nuke hungry mullahs bombed a syrian airfield and destroyed a fifth of assad s jet fighters took the gloves off our military and ended isis s caliphate rolled back obama s cringing concessions to cuba put russia on notice by recommitting to the magnitsky act and increasing sanctions on regime oligarchs unleashed u n ambassador nikki haley on the anti american pygmy states infesting that cockpit in the tower of babel the united nations under trump thornton says america seems to be getting its international mojo back in addition according to journalist and author matthew vadum the president s 11 day asian trip to pearl harbor hawaii tokyo japan seoul south korea beijing the people s republic of china danang the socialist republic of vietnam and in manila the philippines succeeded in bolstering resolve to combat north korean nuclear adventurism and islamic terrorism and to promote his signature america first trade policies after eight years of pathetic servility weakness and apology tours by the poseur president during the trip pres trump scuttled the trans pacific partnership saying we will no longer enter into large agreements that tie our hands surrender our sovereignty make meaningful enforcement practically impossible and produce unfair trade practices and enormous trade deficits for the united states vp mike pence announced that the u s will quit funding refugee programs carried out by the united nations given its failure to protect christian minorities in the wake of genocide and the atrocities of terrorist groups military pres trump removed the poseur president s crushing rules of engagement in combat which tied the hands of our military and resulted in both greater combat and civilian casualties and he empowered military leaders to seize the initiative and win reducing the need for a white house sign off on every mission according to james lewis of the american thinker when president trump dropped the mother of all bombs moab in afghanistan a hundred or more of the worst human beings since hitler died in one big explosion and both our allies and our enemies knew there was a powerful new sheriff in the united states obama would never even name the enemy lewis says and he never ever seemed to get that basic point of morality nor did hillary nor did any other democrat trump and mattis obviously understand it journalist rick moran reminds us that today isis has lost 98 percent of its territory and that now fewer than 1 000 isis fighters remain in iraq and syria and fox news reports that number is down from a peak of nearly 45 000 just two years ago u s officials credit nearly 30 000 u s led coalition airstrikes and regional partners on the ground for killing more than 70 000 jihadists in addition president trump signed the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2018 which approves one of the largest defense spending increases in the past 30 years the ndaa does the following

of care data the best is yet to come conservatives like me knew one thing after observing the poseur president obama after his very first month in office i e that the worst was yet to come sure enough for eight long years we witnessed a remarkable avalanche of apologies for america non stop race baiting the evisceration of our military and a virtual devolution of everything positive america stood for after the big hearted people of america gave a community organizer with not one microsecond of executive or foreign affairs experience a chance to lead the greatest strongest most generous country on earth those same big hearted people regained their sanity and voted for an american patriot with vast executive experience to seize the reins of power and literally to save both america and western civilization for those of us who value safety a strong military a booming economy high employment a belief in the sanctity of life and a reverence for the u s constitution the election of donald j trump was a godsend and we fervently believe that under his leadership the best indeed is yet to come end

it is a very dynamic region pakistan posted a growth rate of 5 8 in the previous fiscal year which although was later officially revised downward to 5 2 was the highest growth rate in 13 years considering this it is not far fetched to think that pakistan may achieve growth of over 6 but the challenge is in maintaining that level liepach said that during the tenure of the previous government economy did near the 6 mark but the problem occurred when it dropped again another adb official present on the occasion conceded to the volatility of the country s growth rate saying every time pakistan tries to go over 5 6 it runs into a balance of payments problem as it needs to import machinery and other things to grow he said that the only sustainable way of maintaining a high growth rate is by avoiding falling into balance of payments problems and going back to the international monetary fund imf which is happening again now liepach was of the view that imf is not to be blamed for pakistan s repeated visits but the country is in a habit of blaming the washington based agency for its repeated visits pakistan blames imf for its repeated visits to the lending agency it has always done that and this is what it loves to do he further said that it was only this once that islamabad managed to push a programme through all the way as normally it abandons the programme halfway and then goes back again if pakistan had followed through on most of the programmes they would not have needed to go to the imf right now the director general stated in order to avoid returning to imf for a bailout package and to control balance of payments deficit there was a need to build up exports and earn enough dollars for sustainable imports the official stated he said that this was really a fundamental issue pakistan is facing which is why the imf programme is also going on right now the former country director said the business environment of pakistan is not really that conducive considering the energy shortages unskilled labour issues international agreements that give preferential access to markets at least at par with other countries a well functioning export finance system would be helpful so there are a couple of things that need to be addressed he remarked even after a massive devaluation of the pakistani rupee against the greenback by 33 since december 2017 exports have seen only a flat growth so far which does not even make up 0 1 of the export growth liepach said you have to pay a lot of taxes on your imports which of course hampers the export competitiveness as well it is naïve to say exports will go up because of the exchange rate as it is not one dimensional in this regard the adb claims to support the government and the reforms we are now preparing a new programme for 500 million that we would like to present to our board perhaps in july it would support export competitiveness in pakistan it will also particularly look at tax and duty rationalisation moreover the adb chief economist yasuyuki sawada also laid down his views regarding the impact of imf on pakistan s economy he told the express tribune that the imf s programme can create some distributional consequences for the lower income group of the country of course imf and the government should really care about the consequences on lower income population sawada said however at the same time a medium term stabilisation of the economy is also quite important he commented we re all aware of this potential issue we care about macroeconomic stabilisation but also keep poverty reduction trend as before stated the adb chief economist macroeconomic risk can generate really huge consequences on lower income people and the poor segment society he said adding in other words imf driven programme is a necessary precondition for robust poverty reduction plan published in the express tribune may 5 2019 like business on facebook follow tribunebiz on twitter to stay

to cut or not to cut that is the question after years of coasting along on the back of outrageous fortune reserve bank princeling philip lowe as another famous plutocrat once observed may just be forced tomorrow to take up arms against a sea of economic troubles right now there s an even money bet as to whether the reserve bank will shave another quarter of a percentage point off the official cash rate ultimately the debate is not about if but when if it doesn t move tomorrow it most likely will be next month and there will be at least two within the next few months two unrelated factors will be weighing on the governor s mind at tomorrow s meeting one is the upcoming election and the potential political fallout from a rate cut in the final days of the campaign the other potentially more significant factor is that the us federal reserve chief jerome powell may just have delivered mr lowe some breathing space by thumbing his nose last week at us president donald trump s demands to cut american interest rates the american central bank boss has put our currency under pressure on friday the aussie battler spent most of the day below us70c a situation that would have delighted the boffins down at the reserve bank for their entire focus now will be on undercutting the currency in an effort to boost growth and inflation and the best way to do that is through slashing rates the case for a cut the long grinding downturn in our housing market finally has begun to bite last week both the anz banking group and nab highlighted a small but significant uptick in the number of homeowners having trouble repaying mortgages according to anz s numbers almost 5 per cent of households now have slipped into what s known as negative equity that s when you owe more on the house than it s worth it s a situation that can become serious if unemployment rises not only do defaulting borrowers lose their home they still end up with debt and losses start mounting in the banking sector ultimately putting the economy further under strain that s also starting to impact spending on friday the federal chamber of automotive industries reported an 8 1 per cent drop in new car sales in april compared with a year earlier while motorcycle holdings told the stock exchange the motorcycle market had shrunk 14 6 per cent in the first three months this year add in an inflation reading of zero in the march quarter and a plunge in annual gdp to just 2 3 per cent and there are some pretty compelling reasons to cut interest rates right now waiting for unemployment to deteriorate as some suggest the rba should would be leaving things too late would a rate cut stop the housing rout it may slow the decline but it won t halt it demand is being crimped by the sudden introduction of responsible lending on the other side of the equation supply is about to explode with several hundred thousand new apartments about to hit the market those two factors combined can only mean one thing further falls in housing prices so why bother with a rate cut nab s interim boss phil chronican last week forcefully argued there was little to gain from another cut to interest rates monetary policy has a lot of potency when it s at high levels when they are at low levels it just doesn t have the same effect he said he s right in some respects so long as you are looking purely at internal dynamics but his comments largely missed the point the real objective behind a rate cut is to sink the aussie dollar in decades past before deregulation a weak currency was considered political suicide oppositions would seize upon a devaluation as a sign of economic mismanagement not any longer governments and central banks for decades have been engaged in a race to the bottom when it comes to currency a weak currency boosts an economy by making exports cheaper and therefore more competitive and imports more expensive which puts domestic industry on a stronger footing why it will work this time australian competitiveness was belted out of the park by the mining boom when our currency soared to almost us1 10 a large swathe of our industry particularly manufacturing was hollowed out it was the final nail in the car industry s coffin the great recession made things even worse the developed world led by the united states fought a currency war that took no prisoners we were among the casualties between them the us japan and europe printed vast sums of cash the idea being that increasing the amount of cash lowered their currency s value the us alone pumped an extra us3 5 trillion into the economy interest rates compared between australia and the usa abc news alistair kroie australia was too small to take part in that war but we can now not through printing money but simply by cutting rates for most of our history australian interest rates have been higher than the united states and other developed nations because we needed imported cash to fund our development but that s all changed as the graph above shows last year us official rates climbed well above ours and it looks as though this will be no fleeting phenomenon america s economy is rebounding and we re slowing on friday night the us jobs numbers were way better than expected it s not so much the level of our rates that matters on that point mr chronican is correct but the gap between our interest rates and america s will have a big impact on the currency it s what s known as the spread the wider it gets in america s favour the weaker our dollar will become that s because investment funds looking for a decent return will scarper offshore in search of higher yields as our dollar sinks inflation in theory at least should escalate and wages should follow helping australian households overcome the mountain of mortgage debt now weighing them down a weaker dollar will deliver bigger returns from our mineral and agricultural exports plus it will ramp up our service industries education and tourism among them the us central bank had planned to continue boosting interest rates through 2019 but last year s stock market plunge in the lead up to christmas which sent mr trump apoplectic kyboshed that idea if the us had continued hiking rates we may have been able to merely sit on our hands for a few more years as america widened the interest rate gap for us that s no longer an option the us now is likely to sit still the onus now is on philip lowe to don the armour
president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping will decide after negotiations this week in washington whether they ll meet to sign off on a pact white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said thursday that the us sees such a meeting as likely concluding a deal will hinge on the two sides resolving the stickiest issues in their dispute they include an enforcement mechanism to police the agreement and a decision over whether tariffs will be removed or stay in place according to people briefed on the talks a sino us deal would be a positive for the global economy when the outlook is dimming and the us is threatening to raise trade tensions with the european union said chang shu chief asian economist at bloomberg economics a deal would also certainly help to relieve the short term stress on the chinese economy as well as facilitate structural reforms for central bank watchers there are monetary policy decisions being made across the world as most turn more dovish here s our weekly rundown of key economic events us and canada the consumer price index to be released on friday will test federal reserve chairman jerome powell s assessment of tepid inflationary pressures as transitory a rebound in apparel prices will likely bring the pace of monthly gains in the rate back into 0 2 percent territory and push the year over year pace up to 2 1 percent according to bloomberg economics surging gasoline prices is seen driving headline cpi inflation higher the producer price index is published the day before bank of canada governor stephen poloz speaks on monday asia central banks in australia new zealand malaysia thailand and the philippines will all decide monetary policy amid gathering signs the region is going to soon start cutting interest rates reductions in the philippines and malaysia are likely and the australians and kiwis could act too for emerging asia that would mark a change in course from last year when countries like indonesia and the philippines were among the world s most aggressive movers as the fed tightened policy the fed s policy pause has created room to shift interest rates lower but with higher oil prices and powell pushing back against pressure to cut borrowing costs that window for action may begin to narrow in china export data will be closely watched on wednesday for more signs the economy is stabilizing europe middle east and africa german industrial production and factory orders reports will help determine just how strong the euro area is after data last week showed most of the region surpassing forecasts in the first quarter industrial production which is released on wednesday is though predicted to have declined in march concurrent with those data the final outlook on eurozone growth and inflation from the european commission before the bloc s parliamentary elections will be released on tuesday also on tuesday the norges bank could signal plans to raise interest rates in the uk friday sees the publication of gross domestic product for the first quarter and a monthly number for march when the economy faced a potential precipice as the brexit deadline loomed president cyril ramaphosa will look to strengthen his grip on power at elections in south africa wednesday as he seeks a mandate to rejuvenate the economy latin america three latin american central banks are expected to remain on hold this week on wednesday brazil will likely keep its key interest rate at an all time low of 6 5 percent as uncertainty about the approval of government reforms constrains its ability to cut despite a weak economy on the following day chile is forecast to leave its benchmark at 3 percent after halting a monetary tightening cycle that had started in october also on thursday peru is predicted to keep borrowing costs at a record low of 2 75 percent for a 14th straight month as its economy grows below potential
the case for a universal basic income ubi is a strong one in some ways a ubi would stimulate aggregate demand help those affected by technological change and create a basic income for the poor its effectiveness and impact however depend on how much is given out the benefits and consequences of a 100 ubi will be very different than one of 1 000 therefore for the purpose of this analysis i will look at the case for a 1 000 per month ubi as suggested by presidential candidate andrew yang previous experiments are not comparable first it must be said that there are a number of cases that suggest ubi does in fact work in alaska each resident gets up to 2 000 per year from the alaska permanent fund the state doesn t call it a ubi but it works in a similar way the difference however is that it is funded by its oil revenues if oil prices go down so do their dividends which fell to 1 100 in 2017 research by damon jones of the university of chicago and ioana marinescu of the university of pennsylvania found it had no impact on employment however this example and many others are not comparable to the 12 000 yang proposes even european trials of ubi in barcelona utrecht and helsinki only grant 590 per month there is no conclusive evidence to suggest this would work in practice while there have been many successful ubi trials few have been tested at over 12 000 per year there have been successful pilots in namibia and india but neither offered a comparable income in namibia for example citizens received 100 namibian dollars per month or just over 7 in india the trial gave each adult 300 indian rupees per month or just over 4 although these sums may help the lives of those in the respective countries they are not comparable to yang s proposal previous experiments with ubi may suggest it would work but they in no way represent the scale of 12 000 there is no conclusive evidence to suggest this would work in practice while the late milton friedman is a source of inspiration he only suggested a modest 300 negative income tax in 1962 in today s money this is equivalent to 2 500 far short of the proposed sum higher prices and inflation a ubi would essentially transfer wealth away from higher earners toward low earners this spurs higher consumption because those with lower incomes have a higher propensity to consume on a macro basis this may not necessarily create any inflation as there is no new money entering the economy however it will create inflation on a micro basis rather than money going toward investment it is going toward consumer goods instead of inflation occurring through a wide variety of areas it is being concentrated importance of velocity yang says this is just using the existing money in the economy in part he is right however he fails to consider the velocity of money one of the reasons the us did not experience significant inflation after quantitative easing was due to a slowing of consumption growth if we put 12 000 into everyone s hands consumer demand will rise and so too will velocity when velocity increases the same 1 exchanges hands at a quicker rate for example a may buy a television from b for 100 b will then buy a used iphone from c for 100 c will then buy a used sofa from d for 100 the initial 100 has circulated around the economy at a value of 300 this sends demand signals to the relevant parties who then respond with higher prices prices react to demand yang also suggests that prices will be kept down by competition his point is that if the cost of a hamburger goes up from 5 to 10 the customer will go elsewhere what he doesn t consider is the impact of supply and demand let s say a barber is only able to cut 10 people s hair per day the barber has 20 customers who want an appointment but he is unable to serve them all is he not going to raise prices because there is a barber down the road the simple demand mechanism tells him there is demand for his service he is unable to meet that demand to achieve the most favorable outcome for the barber it is in his interest to increase prices until there is no excess demand inability to limit government perhaps one of the most important arguments against a ubi is the control it gives government once it is enacted what restricts government from increasing it further after all 12 000 is only on the poverty line what is to prevent government from increasing this to 15 000 to win more votes the constitution itself does not sufficiently restrict government overreach so there is little hope for other legislation those in and around the middle class will most likely be paying more taxes however they will receive this money back so no harm done right well this actually gives even greater power to the state even though the government may take 12 000 to give it back it has control there is nothing to ensure that 12 000 will still be offered in two years government has the ability to withdraw it whenever the political tide turns yang may call it the freedom dividend but it does the opposite it hands even more income from the individual to the government we are living during a period where calls to tax the rich are becoming increasingly popular are we also to expect that a 12 000 ubi to the rich would continue to remain for long perhaps but perhaps not yang may call his proposal the freedom dividend but it in fact does the opposite it hands even more income from the individual to the government for example when inflation takes place the government may not increase the ubi s value it may take in more through taxes but not distribute that money the new funds may then be used to fund the latest project old government programs are often underfunded because they have already served their purpose of getting officials elected in the uk the nhs and education system are always in need of additional funding they are neglected because they no longer serve any political purpose there is nothing to demonstrate that a ubi won t be the same
italy s decision to join china s new silk road project last month has heightened western nations concerns over chinese expansionism though the initiative is likely to disrupt the global power balance and undermine democratic governance it presents a significant opportunity for investors to access untapped resources across the continent china s controversial belt and road initiative is the cornerstone of its ambitious foreign policy strategy the initiative seeks to replicate the historic silk road trading routes through financing a series of projects across asia eastern europe and africa over sixty countries accounting for two thirds of the world s population have indicated their interest or already signed up to projects a perceived threat to the west as countries with unsustainable debt accept chinese bri investment loans there is a significant risk of increasing tensions with western powers the eu commission s emphasis on china s growing economic power and political influence reflects the threat perception italy s decision to join the project has elevated the issue to a new level as the first developed economy and g7 member to join the move has lent the project symbolic legitimacy a total of 29 deals amounting to 2 8bn were signed in rome last month covering energy finance and agricultural sectors for china this endorsement serves as a significant political boost particularly at a time when the eu is seeking to pursue a more unified strategy to address the challenges of china s growing influence china s investment model in developing countries is likely to tolerate corruption and a lack of transparency which has a range of destabilising impacts moreover the risk of the institutionalisation of bri investments in developing countries has increased fears that it could increase the likelihood of the authoritarian model being adapted whilst undermining the political and economic independence of developing countries in the long term therefore the increased presence of china throughout the developing world poses an implicit threat to political liberalism this is a challenge to investors and governments alike meanwhile us china trade tensions continue to simmer the us has attempted to dissuade allies from allowing chinese firm huawei to contribute to 5g networks out of the fears the equipment will be used for espionage these pleas have had mixed success us counter measures the us has established a new development agency the international development finance corporation idfc to curb china s growing influence the agency seeks to mobilise private capital for development and provides resources to emerging markets the 60 million dollar agency is designed to provide countries with a robust alternative to state directed investments by authoritarian governments this comes amidst fears china will challenge american hegemony and rising us china trade tensions as increasing fragile relations continue to strain under pressure the move to counter china s growing geopolitical dominance is a significant reversal in trump s protectionist foreign policy which has often criticised foreign aid increasing fears of the potential security risks chinese technology firm huawei poses has been marked by attempts to restrict foreign investment in the us significant chinese investors are reportedly investing in american start ups working on cutting edge technologies with potential military applications further fuelling fears of the risk of cyber attacks espionage and exposure of the intellectual property washington responded to these risks with the implementation of tariffs on 250 billion chinese exports the tariffs aim to make it difficult for china to gain access to american technology and trade secrets furthermore china s surging investment in pakistan known as the china pakistan economic corridor cpec has further added to concerns over china s growing military ambitions in asia chinese military expansion is a key political and security risk for the us a challenge which threatens the us s international military position debt trap diplomacy the globalisation trap skeptics have also raised concerns that china is consolidating geopolitical power through predatory practices throughout exploitation of its debts china has convinced the sri lankan government to agree to a 99 year lease to operate its strategic hambantota port in greece chinese firms bought 51 of the port authority in piraeus port near athens in 2016 following the economic crisis the likelihood of a chinese monopoly on untapped resources is a concern countries like azerbaijan are known for their oil and natural gas reserves china s singular presence would be problematic for both foreign investors and global powers alike meanwhile for local economies foreign loans and accumulating debt increases the risk of an economic drain without guarantee of sustainable reinvestment into the local economy the bri initiative will be felt on a global stage over the next decade the use of loans to finance projects and the accumulation of unsustainable debt in developing countries remains a significant long term risk as debts could be used to leverage economic political and military power at a micro level emerging economies face the potential risk of a loss of sovereignty over key assets in the long term as high interest debt increases the risk of dependency on china indonesia thailand and the philippines have raised concerns about their growing dependency on chinese investments in infrastructure for investors the bri initiative presents a significant opportunity to access untapped resources in developing regions chinese investment is focussed on infrastructure projects which should aid in enabling foreign investment opportunities however the opportunity is bittersweet the fruits of untapped resources in emerging markets are likely to be barred and undermined by a lack of transparency and total chinese monopoly
getting back in the greatness groove for president trump it s starting to look a bit like 2016 again and for maga types everywhere that s good news the president is likely still savoring the positive headlines on his recent infrastructure initiative such as this from breitbart news on april 30 chuck and nancy applaud donald trump s 2 trillion infrastructure plan interestingly the washington post headline that same day wasn t much different trump top democrats agree on goal of crafting 2 trillion infrastructure plan the new york times header too was good democrats hopeful after meeting with trump on infrastructure for its part the wall street journal joined in reporting that house speaker nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer offered unusually positive comments about negotiations with the president said pelosi this is a collaborative effort and we hope it will be very bipartisan it s about jobs jobs jobs and schumer added there was goodwill in this meeting and that was different than some of the other meetings that we ve had so we can see there s real hope for bipartisan agreement on infrastructure and since power in congress is divided between the parties nothing will happen without bipartisanship yet even if both parties are on board it s still possible to identify the likely biggest winner namely trump on may 1 the day after the white house conclave politico s morning e blast playbook took up the question of who stands to gain the most who wins here if a deal comes together and it s too early to say either way who reaps the political rewards a successful deal would be a massive boon to trump who would be able to say he is the dealmaker he promised to be and can even work with democrats who were investigating him if it falls apart trump probably also benefits he can say democrats couldn t even say yes to a 2 trillion jobs project it s hard to argue with that assessment it s a massive boon to trump if an infrastructure bill passes and if it doesn t a great opportunity to blame congressional democrats earlier this year i wrote about the truman strategy of running against the opposition in congress it did after all work for harry truman in 1948 and for some more historical perspective on the politics of infrastructure we might recall the experience of an earlier republican president dwight eisenhower back on june 29 1956 ike signed the federal aid highway act authorizing the interstate highway system the interstates of course were one of the most pro growth public undertakings in the history of the u s and oh by the way in november 1956 eisenhower was re elected in a landslide carrying 41 states for yet more perspective on the infrastructure issue we might simply recall the year 2016 back in that historic presidential election contest trump campaigned as a different kind of republican that is he was not a goper fixated on such familiar and unpopular gop traps as fighting foreign wars opening the border and skimping on needed domestic investments in particular a key part of trump s differentiation was his call for a massive infrastructure package here s a headline from the new york times on august 2 2016 donald trump proposes to double hillary clinton s spending on infrastructure the article quoted the new york developer as saying we have bridges that are falling down we have many many bridges that are in danger of falling those words were self evidently true after all just a few years before the i 35 bridge had collapsed in minneapolis killing 13 and injuring 145 and as we remember in 2016 the country responded to trump s message he was the first republican presidential candidate in three decades to carry michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin and it was those three states boasting 46 electoral votes that put him over the top trump won 306 electoral votes and he needed of course 270 to win so when trump came into office two and a half years ago all the signs for making american infrastructure great again were promising yet then the white house floundered it let itself get tangled up in budgetary bean counting as well as attempting to design a program centered on public private partnerships ppp ppp are a great idea in theory but then just about everything is a great idea in theory the problem is that in practice ppp can be everything from a good deal to a bad deal for the public that is they re a good deal if they truly leverage private investment for the sake of a worthy public project but they re a bad deal if they simply privatize some public function in a disastrous even scandalous manner as happened when the city of chicago turned over its parking meters to a foreign company so it s no wonder that in recent years public sentiment has turned sharply against ppp all too often rightly or wrongly they are seen as simply privatization that is turning things over to private investor sharpies who then slap a toll on something that the public used to enjoy for free here s a typical sniping headline trump wants to sell our water to wall street thus we can see if the idea of ppp is to regain widespread acceptance projects will have to be better conceived and better pitched yet in the meantime in 2017 and 2018 the political system dismissed the white house s ppp heavy infrastructure effort here for example is the headline from the hill on june 9 2017 trump s infrastructure week goes off the rails and the following year a similar headline in the huffpost on february 15 2018 trump s infrastructure week crumbles again later in 2018 politico added an unsparing header how infrastructure week became a punchline happily now in 2019 trump has absorbed the lesson of past frustration according to jonathan swan of axios who late last month had the scoop on the new infrastructure initiative the president had come to label those earlier infrastructure efforts as gary s plan referring of course to his former economic adviser gary cohn the goldman sachs careerist whom trump doesn t miss in other words trump is now willing to commit real money federal money to his infrastructure push it s that shift that has gotten the democrats interested and without a doubt the need is real a report card published by the american society of civil engineers grades america s infrastructure to be a d so if trump wants to improve said infrastructure and create good jobs at good wages the time is now because the country is worth it paying for infrastructure one key question of course is how to pay for all this new building and constructing two trillion after all is a lot of dollars here three main lines of possibility present themselves first there s the idea of raising taxes raising the gasoline tax is a common suggestion and it is true that it hasn t been raised since 1993 a long time ago on the other hand the idea of a regressive tax increase isn t too popular these days and no american incumbent wants to go through what french president emmanuel macron has been going through after he raised gas taxes as an alternative democrats have suggested raising other taxes including a partial or complete rollback of trump s 2017 tax cuts and jobs act i worked in support of that tax bill the problem with any sort of tax increase of course is that it could neutralize the effect of the infrastructure plan yes more infrastructure is good but so is enhanced american economic competitiveness greater private economic activity and more money in people s pockets so it s not surprising that senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has already issued a firm no to any such tax cut rollback moreover there s little evidence that trump himself wants to pay for his infrastructure plan with a big tax increase that would fracture the conservative coalition after all why would he want to mess with an economic boom 3 2 percent growth in the first quarter of 2019 double the rate of 2016 on the eve of his own re election campaign second there s the possibility of finding new revenue from some unexpected source one such idea is the generating american income and infrastructure now act gaiin which was proposed in the last congress and which breitbart news s matthew boyle wrote about recently as boyle put it the idea behind gaiin is selling off government debt and then using the proceeds for infrastructure funding and debt reduction specifically gaiin targets loans held by the u s department of agriculture bearing a face value of 155 billion at present these loans are typically non performing that is they aren t being paid off and so the idea is that they could be sold to someone better at collecting money than the usda and in the meantime uncle sam would get the cash infusion in addition some advocates point to a total of 2 trillion in loans on the government s books the gaiin approach sounds tempting at least at first and yet upon closer examination significant problems appear for instance there s the question which bad loans would they be for example loans to family farms and related businesses that have been buffeted by for example trade disputes with china and other countries mindful of the need for a careful balancing of trade objectives and domestic pain the trump administration has struggled to compensate farmers in the midst of this trade dispute which was never about farmers anyway so now what would happen with gaiin would the usda loans be sold off to wall street types who would then hire professionally ruthless debt collectors does trump or the gop really want to cause a wave of foreclosures in the farm belt third there s the possibility of simply borrowing the money to pay for infrastructure yes the national debt is more than 22 trillion and that s a lot of money but about 6 trillion of that is held by the government itself which is to say it s really an accounting fiction the true debt is the debt held by the public including the foreign public and that totals about 16 trillion yes even that lesser number seems daunting but we must ask ourselves compared to what after all a debt is manageable so long as you can make the payments it s worth noting that the total household wealth of the united states is more than 100 trillion and the absolute wealth of the country is up around 300 trillion so it s obvious we have plenty of debt carrying capacity moreover as i have also observed if we were to add the mineral wealth of the country buried under federal lands and waters we could add at least another 100 trillion in fact it s because of all this wealth actual and potential that the financial markets are untroubled by u s debt in addition the whole wide world is awash in capital that s why interest rates are so low to be sure rates are higher than they were earlier in this decade and in fact as recently as april 30 trump has criticized these rate hikes as unnecessary and harmful to growth yet even so the federal funds rate is lower than at any time in the 90s 80s or 70s in any case the critical issue with borrowing is what you get for the debt that is if you borrow the money to pay for a productive asset you re being smart and that seems to be trump s idea we should be smart about borrowing for better roads newer airports and improved technology such as 5g as trump said in 2016 as he talked up his campaign infrastructure package we re going to go out with a fund we ll get a fund make a phenomenal deal with low interest rates and rebuild our infrastructure we d do infrastructure bonds now in 2019 trump

a year ago bird rides inc was flying high and silicon valley was betting that it would keep on climbing thousands of the santa monica start up s signature black and white scooters appeared on street corners across the world bought with venture capital and rented to smartphone toting riders advertisement investors saw how quickly riders took to the new mode of transit and visions of uber size growth and revenues flitted through their heads in march 2018 just six months after the first bird hit the pavement venture funds poured in 100 million in june they dumped an additional 300 million bird s valuation soared to 2 billion in a matter of months but today facing a crowded field of competitors pushback and fees from local governments and fundamental questions about whether any company can make money by releasing electric scooters into the wild and charging per ride staying aloft is proving harder than it first appeared advertisement growing from 50 million to something like 2 billion in eight months has never happened before and is probably not supposed to happen said bradley tusk an early bird investor and former uber advisor known for helping the ride hailing firm navigate its early political battles if this was a normal start up that was 2 years old yeah of course they haven t figured everything out yet this is not the point in the cycle where you d sweat it tusk said but a normal start up also wouldn t be looking at a 2 billion valuation the first ill omens came in january when the company quietly raised another 300 million at the same 2 billion valuation in an industry that prizes a perpetual uptick in valuation to propel a narrative of constant growth a flat round spells trouble and often a desperate need for cash advertisement around the same time the company deleted all mention from its website of its commitment to give cities a dollar per scooter per day to maintain infrastructure and build more bike lanes though many of the deals it reached with individual cities contain fees in march bird laid off 5 of its workforce which had grown to more than 700 bird zeros are lined up near the beach in venice katie falkenberg los angeles times and the company s official strategy began to shift in the whirlwind summer days of 2018 bird had adhered to the start up mantra grow at all costs but as 2019 arrived bird chief executive travis vanderzanden a lyft and uber alumnus started to sing a different tune advertisement 2018 was about scaling he said at a malibu tech conference in january 2019 is about really focusing on the unit economics of the business by unit economics vanderzanden meant the simple math of making money on each scooter dropped into the world and while trying to make money might seem like a basic imperative for any business it goes counter to the preferred pattern for 18 month old start ups flush with venture capital cash many venture backed businesses operate on the idea that new companies should spend their first years focused on increasing market share at the expense of actually making money once everyone in the world uses their product the thinking goes they can achieve economies of scale come up with innovations that smaller companies couldn t pull off or simply reap the benefits of being a monopoly advertisement this strategy termed blitzscaling in a popular business book written by linkedin co founder reid hoffman paid off for world eating firms such as amazon facebook and netflix and has been the animating principle behind uber and lyft which have been locked in a deeply unprofitable race for maximal market share from day one there are very few unique companies for which you can build global scale really quickly and build a dominant market position before other people do and for those rarefied companies scaling quickly matters more than short term profits said mark suster an early bird investor and general partner at the santa monica fund upfront ventures this is one of those rarefied companies and markets but most start ups that follow the hypergrowth model are built on software and in the case of such companies as uber and lyft creative applications of labor law bird and its competitors including lime spin uber and lyft are in the much less forgiving business of managing a fleet of breakable stealable scooters advertisement it s not that there isn t a viable business model for these companies said dmitry shevelenko an investor who s worked at uber advised bird competitor skip and is building a company that would allow scooters to slowly drive themselves to meet users or dock at charging stations it s just not the uber business model that s what bird and lime were raising against and that s where there probably will be a correction vanderzanden acknowledged in january that the company was far from solving its fundamental economic problem the tens of thousands of scooters bird had spread across the world a mix of retail models made by ninebot the parent company of segway and xiaomi broke down or were stolen or vandalized long before they could earn back their cost those things were fragile he said clearly the unit economics didn t work on those scooters but that was a test anyway advertisement the company is pinning its hopes on the bird zero a custom scooter with longer battery life and sturdier construction a bird zero foreground and other scooters along the beach in santa monica katie falkenberg los angeles times bird declined to share details on unit economics with the times for this article but vanderzanden told tech website the verge in march that the scooters would need to stay active for six months around 180 days for the company to just break even on the purchase price once charging repair and permit costs were factored in advertisement but based on a times review of data used in bird s smartphone application even the supposedly new and improved models are falling short nearly 7 000 scooters appeared to be active in los angeles county in january having logged a ride in the previous two weeks by april more than 5 500 of those same scooters appeared to be removed from active duty with no rides logged for the prior two weeks and the average life of those inactive scooters based on the time elapsed between their first logged ride and their last before going dark was 126 days advertisement the apparent life span varied between models the xiaomi m365 the consumer model with which bird first launched averaged 124 days on the street the two segway models the esb and esx diverged in their reliability the simpler esb averaged 155 days while the esx ostensibly more advanced with a longer battery life and easier to service parts lasted only 82 days on average bird zeros averaged only 116 days these life spans are far higher than those reported in louisville ky according to a quartz analysis of detailed ride data that the city published as part of a transparency program the 129 scooters all retail models that were initially deployed there lasted just 29 days on average bird disputed the accuracy of these life span estimates a ninebot bird scooter is ridden near the beach in venice katie falkenberg los angeles times advertisement suster who works closely with bird as an investor echoed the company s stance i assure you the negative narrative is not correct he said he said retail scooters the xiaomi and ninebot models had a life span of three to four months but bird zero s already getting eight to 12 he said adding that a next generation model with better life span ride experience and ease of repair was already in the pipeline for late 2019 bird has experimented with its business model in recent months in early march the company altered its repair program in los angeles which had relied on gig workers to fix broken scooters it moved repairs in house though scooters are still charged each night by an army of gig workers later that month the company introduced scooters with locks in some markets in a bid to prevent theft and vandalism advertisement in april it announced the launch of a more traditional rental program in san francisco and barcelona in which users could pay 25 per month to rent a xiaomi m365 from the company rather than paying per ride the company also raised prices on its core dockless product in cities across america riders once paid a dollar to unlock a scooter and then a flat rate of 15 cents per minute of riding now per minute fees have increased to 25 cents in los angeles and austin 29 cents in baltimore and 33 cents in detroit and charlotte in other cities such as bloomington ind and charlottesville va rates went down to 10 cents per minute and since last year the company has been promoting bird platform which sells scooters and technical services to local operators around the world in exchange for a 20 cut of their revenue advertisement experimentation is the norm at start ups especially young ones but moves that prioritize balance sheets over growth are more common in firms short on cash or those looking for an exit either through acquisition or an initial public offering bird s competitors face the same challenges lime bird s biggest competitor with more than 700 million raised continues to pursue an aggressive growth strategy though it is not permitted to operate in its hometown of san francisco skip which shares exclusive rights to the san francisco market with scoot pulled in 100 million in debt financing in december spin which ford bought for close to 100 million in november is unique in using only in house chargers and mechanics a bird and a lime scooter in santa monica katie falkenberg los angeles times uber and lyft which have valuations and cash flows from their core ride hailing businesses that dwarf those of scooter only companies both have scooter operations as well uber operates jump advertisement investors and mobility experts remain optimistic that bird or at least some form of a mass scooter business will land on a viable strategy before the cash flow dries up many cited a section of uber s recent regulatory filings which predicted that a majority of trips under three miles will happen on electric scooters as opposed to cars in the near future it s a complicated business with lots of issues to resolve from unit economics to regulatory to marketing tusk said but the market is so big and there s so much opportunity as the world trends towards congested urbanization that the thesis holds for a while advertisement others pointed to a possible soft landing for scooters as a component of city transit services along the lines of existing bike share programs juan matute deputy director of ucla s institute of transportation studies said that public private partnerships could spark more investment in charging stations which would reduce costs and compel law enforcement to pay more attention to theft and vandalism the unit economics might work out as a result of all this vc investment matute said and then some of the less sexy smaller providers that have been involved in the bike share space can start offering some of these types of vehicles as a city contracted managed provider scooter companies are betting that more durable two wheelers will lead to profitability though questions about brand loyalty remain advertisement suster says bird s head start on the competition has given it operations expertise and a wealth of rider data that constitute a moat a defense against any competitors trying to steal its business it looks so easy you just put these scooters out and have revenue suster said but it s a complex asset management business like owning airplanes or trains our ability to maintain these scooters at cost repair them quickly and have them back out in the street at scale means our advantage is much greater than any new entrant sam dean latimes com advertisement follow me on twitter samaugustdean

to washington david macnaughton was in ottawa on tuesday and the response to the removal of many of the safeguards and the continued u s steel and aluminum levy was top of the agenda the safeguards that expired last week were imposed by ottawa last october on seven steel products to protect against dumping in the canadian market by steel displaced by trump s attempts to keep out imports from

graciously they should now be repealed macnaughton said he has told policy makers in washington that the deal will not be rubber stamped in ottawa without an end to tariffs but he is careful to state that this is not the government s official position it should be still events are moving in canada s favour chuck grassley the chair of the u s senate s finance committee said this week that congress

there was something bigger than opec cuts demand with the latest inventory spike a generous 30 million barrels have been added to u s crude stockpiles in just over five weeks a statistic certain to perish any thought the saudis and other powers that be at opec may have had of raising production when they meet on june 25 many theories abound as to the reason for the builds the bears say it is an outright reflection of weak demand the bulls argue that they are an extension of the export issues at the houston ship channel since a chemical fire in early march and remedy works thereafter that

the federal reserve held interest rates steady on wednesday for the third time this year ignoring calls from president donald trump to slash rates by as much as one full percentage point in order to further boost the economy we have the potential to go up like a rocket if we did some lowering of rates like one point tweeted trump on tuesday with our wonderfully low inflation we could be setting major records china is adding great stimulus to its economy while at the same time keeping interest rates low our federal reserve has incessantly lifted interest rates even though inflation is very low and instituted a very big dose of quantitative tightening we have the potential to go donald j trump realdonaldtrump april 30 2019 the last time the fed cut its benchmark lending rate by one point was in december 2008 when the nation was in the grip of a financial crisis today with gdp at 3 2 percent annual growth unemployment at a near historic low of 3 8 percent and the stock market chalking up record highs the economy is far from recession era levels however economic growth in the u s is expected to slow this year as the wider global economy cools and the impact of trump s 1 5 trillion fiscal stimulus plan begins to fade a monthslong trade war between the u s and china continues to weigh on global economic growth while the fed has continually emphasized its independence it has faced increasing pressure from trump he has repeatedly and publicly criticized the central bank and its leadership despite nominating jerome powell a republican multimillionaire and former hedge fund investor to be chairman in december the fed raised rates for the fourth time in a year and said it would recommend two rate hikes this year markets plunged and trump blamed powell for the sell off a rebuke that roiled markets and even prompted an 11th hour call to the nation s top banks from treasury secretary steven mnuchin to confirm that markets can continue to function properly at its march meeting the fed sharply changed course indicating no hikes at all for 2019 the major stock market indexes are currently up by around 22 percent since their december lows the fed s stated goal as assigned by congress is to promote maximum employment and price stability through monetary policy yet powell has found he must walk a fine line between pleasing markets and the white house while maintaining the agency s independence in the face of political pressure i think the fed has shown over the last several years to be very equity market dependent andrew thrasher founder of thrasher analytics told nbc news their actions have often followed large moves within the u s stock market creating a third unofficial mandate for the federal reserve of volatility management increased politicization around future policy makers at the fed has also come into focus trump s most recent picks for two spots on the fed s board of governors have faltered before any official nomination process could begin herman cain withdrew last month after losing senate support for his possible nomination after repeatedly criticizing the central bank and weathering a series of sexual harassment allegations in withdrawing his name from consideration for the fed position cain cited the strict ethical restrictions that would have limited his income while serving on the fed board the potential nomination of stephen moore has also met with controversy in addition to questions related to his nonpayment of thousands of dollars of alimony and child support to his ex wife the economics commentator has long expressed disdain for the central bank in a recent write up moore called for powell to resign and criticized the fed s crackerjack logic and tone deaf monetary policy the white house said this week that it would be reviewing moore s writings in view of his suitability for the position when we have an update on that front we ll let you know white house press secretary sarah sanders told reporters on monday the fed s current interbank lending rate ranges from 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent it is used by financial institutions to determine interest on consumer debt such as credit cards car loans and home equity loans

starting in may the white house hopes to extinguish iran s oil exports however any destabilization may prove counter productive and cause long term damage to the united states the region and global prospects for three years the nuclear accord jcpoa offered iran relief from the multilateral sanctions on energy financial shipping automotive and other sectors the shift in the u s policy began in late 2016 when the congress extended the iran sanctions act for a decade that emboldened trump s unipolar stance but what are the immediate economic and strategic implications implications of three step destabilization regionally trump s stance leans on saudi arabia for economic and geopolitical support as evidenced by the 110 billion arms deal with riyadh in 2017 and reinforced security ties with israel the increasing convergence of the u s saudi and israeli interests in the middle east reflects a quest for regional primacy initially john bolton trump s neoconservative national security advisor urged trump to bury the jcpoa and push for a regime change before february 2019 the 50th anniversary of the iranian revolution the new timeline is more flexible but the old objectives remain the three step destabilization was started with the rejection of jcpoa juridical pressure which was followed by sanctions to cause economic pain that would provide the pretext for regime change military intervention in the name of peace and democracy despite deficiencies data on iran s crude oil indicates some trends according to opec iran s crude oil production remained around 3 8 million barrels per day until the 2012 sanctions which caused the capacity to plunge to 3 million following the jcpoa iran s production soared rapidly back to 4 million barrels with trump s electoral triumph and the concerted effort at regime change the capacity has steadily decreased to less than 3 7 million barrels figure 1 figure 1 iran s crude oil production 2009 2019 000s b d if iran s production capacity takes a hit that will penalize particularly its biggest importers that is china india south korea and turkey which accounted for two thirds of all iranian exports in 2017 along with japan turkey europe italy france and uae figure 2 consequently the strategic responses to u s sanctions by iran s major export destinations matter available data on oil purchases in the past 6 12 months indicate that china india and turkey have reduced their buys by about 25 respectively japan by 20 and south korea almost entirely yet the role of unknown sources in iran s oil exports has quadrupled figure 2 iran s oil exports by countries 2017 share of total conversely import diversification tells something about their degree of reliance on iran last year china s largest crude oil importer was russia followed by saudi arabia angola and iraq these top 4 suppliers accounted for half of china s total oil imports among them iran ranked seventh accounting for 6 3 of the chinese total in turn india s largest suppliers featured saudi arabia iraq iran and nigeria which accounted some 60 percent of the total among these iran was third accounting for 11 of the total that is twice as much as to china in relative terms figure 3 figure 3 key oil importers of china and india 2018 share of total last year global purchases of imported crude oil totaled 1 2 trillion reflecting robust demand from 129 countries asian countries accounted for more than half of the total the largest oil importer was china 20 2 of total crude oil importers followed by the u s 13 8 india 9 7 and japan 6 8 figure 5 figure 4 world s leading oil importers 2018 billion of total obstacles to the regime change ploy in may 2018 trump had the u s withdraw from the jcpoa while pledging to reimpose u s secondary sanctions by november 2018 the reinstatement drove iran s economy into mild recession as major companies exited the iranian economy rather than risk being penalized by the u s iran s oil exports have decreased significantly and the value of iran s currency has declined sharply the eu and some other countries are trying to sustain the economic benefits of the jcpoa flowing to iran hoping to keep tehran in the accord from iran s viewpoint these efforts have been promising but remain far from adequate geopolitically the destabilization of iran is designed to foster the regional supremacy of america s key allies in the region particularly saudi arabia and the gulf states strategically the iran sanctions serve major oil exporters which just happen to be among the key suppliers of both china and india respectively that is saudi arabia iraq and the gulf oman kuwait uae qatar nevertheless the trump hawks iran plans are based on misguided assumptions saudi arabia and uae can boost higher production levels some of the time but not all of the time a protracted effort could destabilize markets further more importantly saudi arabia and the u s can offer mainly light crude oil but not heavy oil which many countries need for refined oil products and which iran can offer furthermore china and turkey which oppose u s unilateralism along with possibly india and some eu allies will try to work around u s sanctions for economic geopolitical and development reasons while china is not critically reliant on iranian oil it vehemently opposes unipolar bullying there is also the last resort scenario if the white house will push iran against the wall it could close the strait of hormuz which none of oil exporters and importers want the trump administration believes that america s military superiority economic clout and energy dominance suffice to undermine the jcpoa and achieve regime change yet u s shale oil is not adequate to dictate unipolar terms to the rest of the international community moreover most americans see u s involvement against iran as an unnecessary risk finally u s economic power is overshadowed by its 22 trillion sovereign debt and the end of the expansionary cycle global repercussions the jcpoa fostered iran s economic development which would have had a constructive effect on its regional role u s efforts at regime change have not played out expectedly even in venezuela and iran is far more capable and determined to defend its rights in the international arena with the support of much of the international community economically sanctions against any major oil exporter will diminish total capacity worldwide and boost crude prices before the 2008 global crisis oil prices soared to almost 150 per barrel after a severe plunge to 40 they returned to 100 in the early 2010s as the fed s rate hikes caused the u s dollar to strengthen oil prices which remain denominated in dollars plunged to mid 20s since then fed hikes have normalized and u s dollar steadied which supports rising prices figure 6 figure 5 oil prices 2000 2019 until the late 1960s america was still an oil exporter in the past half a century it has been an importer which has constrained its geopolitical aspirations that is now changing to president trump america s energy dominance means not just economic but geopolitical muscle that explains much of recent u s assertiveness and regime change plans in iran and venezuela yet u s production accounts for barely 15 of global output which limits its ability to move global oil markets despite its vocal threats the trump white house is in a double bind if it does not deliver regime change in iran it will be seen as a paper tiger which will further erode u s credibility in the middle east if it executes its violent plans the result could be years of violent turmoil destabilized region derailed global prospects and oil prices exposed to new supply shocks dr dan steinbock is an internationally recognized

president donald trump turned up the pressure on china on sunday threatening to hike tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese goods washington ap president donald trump turned up the pressure on china on sunday threatening to hike tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese goods trump s comments delivered on twitter came as a chinese delegation was scheduled to resume talks in washington on wednesday aimed at resolving a trade war that has shaken financial markets and cast gloom over the world economy trump turned up the heat by saying he would raise import taxes on 200 billion in chinese products to 25 from 10 on friday he d twice pushed back deadlines in january and march to raise the tariffs in a bid to buy more time for a negotiated settlement but on sunday trump who has called himself a tariff man said he s losing patience the trade deal with china continues but too slowly as they attempt to renegotiate no trump tweeted in his tweets trump also threatened to slap tariffs on another 325 billion in chinese imports covering everything china ships annually to the united states the two countries are locked in a high stakes dispute over china s push to establish itself as a technological super power the u s charges that china is resorting to predatory tactics including cybertheft and forcing foreign companies to hand over technology in a drive to establish chinese companies as world leaders in advanced industries such as robotics and electric vehicles the administration has repeatedly suggested that the negotiators are making progress a month ago trump said that the two countries were rounding the turn and predicted that something monumental would be achieved in the next few weeks but last week treasury secretary steven mnuchin seemed to temper expectations suggesting that washington was willing to move on if it can t get the deal it wants a substantive deal would require china to rethink the way it pursues its economic ambitions abandoning or scaling back subsidies to its companies easing up on the pressure for foreign companies to share trade secrets and giving them more access to the chinese market philip levy senior fellow at the chicago council on global affairs and a white house economist under president george w bush said the talks are too complicated for trump s high pressure tactics to work the president treats this like we re haggling over the price of a used car levy said trump has made a priority of shaking up american trade policy as a candidate for the presidency trump raged repeatedly about alleged chinese perfidy so much so that a video mashup of him spitting out the word china went viral and collected more than 15 million views on youtube com trump charged that previous administrations gullible and weak had let china get away with abusive trade practices accepting empty promises from beijing and allowing the u s china economic relationship to grow ever more lopsided as evidence he pointed to america s vast u s trade deficit with china 379 billion last year by far the biggest with any country in the world once he took office trump s relationship with his chinese counterpart xi jinping seemed to get off to a good start the two men shared chocolate cake and amiable conversation at trump s resort in mar a lago florida in april 2017 a few weeks later china agreed to open its market u s beef cooked chicken and natural gas in what commerce secretary wilbur ross called a herculean accomplishment the romance faded in march 2018 the office of the u s trade representative issued a report accusing china of using predatory tactics to strengthen its tech companies last july the trump administration gradually began slapping import taxes on chinese goods to pressure beijing into changing its policies it now has imposed 10 tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports and 25 tariffs on another 50 billion the chinese have retaliated by targeting 110 billion in u s imports the fight between the world s two biggest economies is raising worries about global economic growth the international monetary fund the world bank and others have downgraded their forecasts for the world economy saying the u s china standoff is reducing world trade and creating uncertainty for companies trying to decide where to buy supplies build factories and make investments trump has portrayed his tariffs as a moneymaker for the united states and a benefit to the u s economy but a march study by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university found that the burden of trump s tariffs including taxes on steel aluminum solar panels and chinese imports falls entirely on u s consumers and businesses who buy imported products by the end of last year the study found they were paying 3 billion a month in higher taxes and absorbing 1 4 billion a month in lost efficiency nonetheless the overall u s economy has remained healthy on friday the government reported that the u s unemployment rate had fallen to the lowest level in half a century the prospect of higher tariffs and heightened tensions could alarm investors when markets open monday when the president puts his foot down it makes the market go down chris rupkey chief financial economist at mufg union bank wrote in a research note sunday tariff man is back just in time to make the stock market dive

in the united states a college education has long been one of the best ways to become a member of the middle class a college degree usually leads to higher pay stronger job security a greater chance of home ownership and comparatively secure family life these qualities have long been seen as worth the sacrifices often required those sacrifices can include the money spent paying off student loans and the years waiting for a return on one s investment in higher education yet u s college graduates are not as likely as they once were to feel they belong to the middle class that is a finding of the 2018 general social survey or gss the associated press norc center for public affairs research and gss researchers jointly examined the study they found that 35 percent of college graduates described themselves as working or lower class that s an increase from 1983 when only 20 percent felt that way not surprisingly americans without a college degree have long felt even less connected to the middle class last year six in 10 of them described themselves as working or lower class about the same as the percentage who said so in 1983 the study did not define middle class those questioned gave answers based on their own opinions the u s economy has been expanding for nearly 10 years and the nation s unemployment rate is at 3 8 percent yet the financial concerns that affect many college graduates point to the widening divide between the wealthiest americans and everyone else dan black is an economist at the university of chicago he suggests that over time this general trend could lead to delayed family formation lower levels of spending by graduates and eventually slower economic growth concerns like this will definitely have impacts for the economy black told the associated press widening economic inequality released in march the 2018 gss survey found that as the country recovered from the 2008 2009 recession many americans have benefited both college graduates and those without degrees are earning more money now but across age groups a college degree has become less of a guarantee of rising to a better position in society last year the pew research center reported that in 2016 a middle class household was one earning between 45 200 and 135 600 a year it also reported that about 52 percent of american adults lived in middle class households higher education still offers a path upward but that path has been narrowed by student debt rising housing prices and widening economic inequality differences in pay go well beyond the divide between the top one percent of earners and everyone else differences are widening even within many career fields including financial advisers legal experts and medical doctors the result is that what may seem like a middle class job description may provide a pay level more often linked with a lower middle class job martha gimbel is research director for the jobs website indeed com using information from the u s bureau of labor statistics gimbel studied the divide between what the top 10 percent of a career field earned compared with the bottom 10 percent the top 10 percent of u s lawyers earned more than 208 000 last year that amount of money makes the legal occupation look extremely well paying but the bottom 10 percent earned less than 58 200 which could make it difficult to repay law school debt people might seek to become a lawyer doctor or financial adviser because they see big salaries gimbel said but there is a lot of range in what those workers make they need to remember that they could be one of the unsuccessful lawyers or real estate brokers americans are also more likely than they were before the 2008 2009 recession to say they feel overworked eighty percent of college graduates say they work more than 40 hours per week that is 10 percent higher than those who did not finish college graduates are also 10 percent more likely than non graduates to say they have more work to do than they can complete among college graduates who feel disconnected from the middle class is justin provo of chicago at age 28 provo says student debt has blocked his move to becoming middle class he borrowed a total of 58 000 to attend roosevelt university in illinois in 2017 he earned a degree in economics and philosophy now working for a loan servicing company provo says his earnings based loan repayment plan is not enough to fully cover the interest on his loans so while he is making monthly payments on his student loans his debt level keeps rising i m making some progress but i don t feel like i m getting anywhere he said the federal reserve bank of new york reports that u s student debt now totals nearly 1 5 trillion that is more than five times what it was in 2004 researchers suggest that rising levels of student loan debt between 2005 and 2014 have prevented home ownership for about 400 000 young people at the same time some studies have shown that student debt has also delayed marriages and household formation economists have noted that rising college debt has in a way become the cost of entrance into the job market nearly 80 percent of the 2 million overall job gains last year went to college graduates just a third of u s adults hold a degree soncia coleman is a senior director at young invincibles her group works in support of the current generation of college aged

existing entries germany s uniper said it is planning to undertake a debottlenecking program at its ultra low sulfur fuel oil production facility in fujairah in august uniper energy s managing director christopher wood told delegates at the 11th international fujairah bunkering fuel oil forum the turnaround that we are expecting in august for the refinery we ve found some areas that we can debottleneck and increase capacity increase flexibility wood said uniper has two 40 000 b d distillation columns in fujairah which have been designed to process low sulfur crude oils to produce ultra low low sulfur fuel oil satorp has awarded a contract to kbr to debottleneck train 2 of its 440 000 b d refinery in jubail on saudi arabia s persian gulf coast kbr said the debottlenecking project is expected to increase the original refinery s throughput by 15 once completed in august 2020 the project will be delivered to support the upcoming major refinery turnaround in 2020 kbr also said upon

tehran refinery which consists of 20 25 units carries out some works every year its catalyst units undergo basic maintenance every three years whereas the cycle for the non catalyst units is once every four years iran s isfahan plans maintenance in the iranian year which started march 21 from the iranian month of farvardin to khordad as well as in the months of mehr to aban iran s tabriz has maintenance scheduled for june 2019 involving units in its zone a such as the new gasoline production unit and lpg and distillation units it will take 10 15 days and will impact some of the facility s products output upgrades new and revised entries the isfahan refinery in central iran is currently building a new distillation unit the project has taken around three years to complete with the commissioning currently underway lasting around six months the unit will not add extra capacity as even though the plant s nameplate capacity is 200 000 b d it has been processing 375 000 b d for years the refinery expects to have its upgraded diesel unit operational and subsequently reduce its throughput to 360 000 b d after its launch the unit will produce around 16 million l day of euro 4 gasoil currently it produces around 20 million l d of gasoil of which only 4 million l d meet euro specs separately at isfahan a 650 million contract was signed to upgrade mazut and reduce its output abu dhabi national oil co said its carbon black and delayed coker unit commissioned in september 2018 has produced the uae s first ever calcined coke now being shipped to china the production of calcined coke is a significant step towards being a refining business capable of producing zero fuel oil the company said in a statement it added that the new unit allows adnoc to extract the maximum value from sulfur heavy bottom of the barrel oils and slurry as it delivers on its downstream strategy the company said it made zero fuel oil refining a high priority when the international marine organization s 2020 regulation was first proposed aimed at reducing the sulfur content contained in marine fuels from 3 5 to 0 5 in an effort to limit the potential environmental impact of global shipping fleets the plan for the fourth phase of the persian gulf star gas condensates refinery in iran has changed and it will now produce sweet naphtha as opposed to the original plan to be a gasoline production facility the country s oil ministry news service reported the refinery has decided to increase the throughput of feedstock in the three phases already operational which stands at 400 000 b d of gas condensates from 360 000 b d previously the move increases the production capacity of the gasoline and distillation units the report said before the mission of the fourth phase of the persian gulf star refinery was to refine 120 000 b d of gas condensates but with the changes applied this phase has been named as the phase for optimization of capacity and removal of the bottlenecks of the existing phases mohammad ali davdar managing director of the refinery was quoted as saying with the increase of refining capacity in the three existing phases from 120 000 180 000 b d we can divide the production expected from the fourth phase among the three phases and save the investment and use it in other parts of the industry dadvar said existing entries kbr has been awarded a contract by saudi aramco to provide technology license basic engineering design and equipment for its solvent deasphalting technology for the riyadh refinery residue upgrading and clean fuels

a raft of surprisingly strong recent economic data is likely to bolster president trump s case as he heads into the 2020 election the u s labor market blew past expectations by adding 263 000 jobs in april with the unemployment rate falling to the lowest level in 50 years and gross domestic product growth accelerated at a 3 2 percent annual rate in the first quarter financial markets have rebounded to record highs after a bloody end to 2018 while wage growth is slowly increasing after years of near stagnation mosads economists had widely expected the u s economy to slow this year with some raising the specter of a potential recession but those fears have fallen by the wayside and the strong top line numbers give democrats few openings to attack trump on the state of the economy markets were wrong about the risks of a recession at the turn of the year the economy still has significant momentum wrote diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton in a friday research note that s left democrats looking to unseat trump instead focusing on the president s push to roll back regulations which they argue has left workers with fewer protections and on wide swaths of the country still struggling to get by regardless of the economic numbers most people feel like they re working harder but not getting ahead wrote zac mccrary partner at progressive polling firm alg research in a friday email people don t vote based on macro economic metrics they vote based on what s happening in their own lives the economy will take center stage in 2020 trump and congressional republicans have claimed credit for boosting the economy through massive tax cuts and sweeping deregulation when trump took office in january 2017 he inherited a solid but slowly growing economy from former president obama the unemployment rate was 4 7 percent but gdp grew only 1 6 percent in 2016 the slowest level of economic growth since 2011 the economy has kicked into another gear since trump s election with unemployment sinking to 3 6 percent in april and gdp growth coming close to 3 percent in 2018 trump and vice president mike pence have toured the country to tout the strong economy frequently in midwestern states that voted for obama in 2012 but delivered the white house to republicans in 2016 republicans have focused on the combination of a near record low unemployment rate with quicker gdp and wage growth the strong april jobs report released friday by the labor department gave trump new ammunition we can all agree that america is now 1 trump said in a friday tweet accompanied by a picture of the drudge report homepage touting the april hiring boom we are the envy of the world and the best is yet to come democrats though argue obama should get credit for the burst of prosperity they say the u s is finally reaping the full benefits of his efforts to rebuild the economy economic analysts say the stimulatory effects of gop tax cuts and the sharp increase in government spending are likely short lived even so republicans believe the recent spurt of economic growth stands to benefit trump as he seeks re election polls find trump broadly unpopular but they also show the public giving him high marks for his handling of the economy roughly 53 percent of americans disapprove of trump s presidency according to a fivethirtyeight average of approval polls updated on friday but 56 percent of respondents to a cnn poll said they approved of trump s economic record a new high for his presidency it s the economy stupid is still mostly operative stuart roy a gop strategist and former aide to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky wrote in an email citing the unofficial slogan of former president clinton s first white house campaign in 1992 the strong economy wasn t enough to prevent republicans from losing their house majority in the 2018 midterm elections the strong current numbers numbers have 2020 democrats trying to focus their economic messaging in more nuanced ways democrats have focused on the 2017 tax law which included a large corporate tax cut that sunk the bill s popularity liberal critics of the president argued that the cuts favored wealthy individuals and big businesses over middle and working class americans and there are early signs that the argument could be effective in an election against trump a poll conducted by alg research in march found that 75 percent of likely 2020 voters and 60 percent of republican support raising taxes on the rich including 60 percent of republicans voters do not feel that the trump tax bill lowered their taxes in fact many believe their taxes have gone up while the benefits went to the wealthy and the corporations mccrary wrote several 2020 candidates have proposed raising taxes on the wealthy to tackle income inequality and fund several ambitious policy plans presidential candidate sen elizabeth warren d mass outlined a special annual tax on those with a net worth higher than 50 million her plan would apply a 2 percent tax each year on net worth between 50 million and 1 billion and a 3 percent tax above 1 billion sen kamala harris d calif proposed a tax credit of 6 000 for every family making less than 100 000 a year it would be funded by reversing trump tax cuts for earners making more than 100 000 and imposing a tax on financial institutions with more than 50 billion in assets and sen cory booker d n j who is also running for president has introduced a bill to create a federally funded savings account for every child funded by boosting the estate tax and capital gains tax democratic candidates have also tried to woo voters attracted to trump s populist rhetoric with policies meant to rein in corporate behemoths and unpopular industries warren has proposed a plan to break up the largest tech companies arguing that they distort markets and exploit working and middle class americans several candidates have also embraced an expansion of government health insurance under the umbrella medicare for all to insulate voters from the rising costs of healthcare healthcare costs are going up for families and donald trump is part of the problem wrote mccrary that message beat dozens of republicans incumbents in 2018 can beat donald trump in 2020 but whether those appeals can overcome a strong economy remains to be seen if democrats are forced to nitpick prosperity they are casting their lot with a smaller portion of the public countered roy

president donald trump turned up the pressure on china on sunday threatening to hike tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese goods trump s comments delivered on twitter came as a chinese delegation was scheduled to resume talks in washington on wednesday aimed at resolving a trade war that has shaken financial markets and cast gloom over the world economy trump turned up the heat by saying he would raise import taxes on 200 billion in chinese products to 25 from 10 on friday he had twice pushed back deadlines in january and march to raise the tariffs in a bid to buy more time for a negotiated settlement but on sunday trump who has called himself a tariff man said he s losing patience the trade deal with china continues but too slowly as they attempt to renegotiate no trump tweeted in his tweets trump also threatened to slap tariffs on another 325 billion in chinese imports covering everything china ships annually to the united states president donald trump turned up the pressure sunday on china threatening to hike tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese goods and slap new ones on another 325 billion in goods he and chinese president xi jinping are pictured in november 2017 in china the new tariff arrangements trump is threatening would cover everything beijing ships to the u s the two countries are locked in a high stakes dispute over china s push to establish itself as a technological super power the u s charges that china is resorting to predatory tactics including cybertheft and forcing foreign companies to hand over technology in a drive to establish chinese companies as world leaders in advanced industries such as robotics and electric vehicles the administration has repeatedly suggested that the negotiators are making progress a month ago trump said that the two countries were rounding the turn and predicted that something monumental would be achieved in the next few weeks but last week treasury secretary steven mnuchin seemed to temper expectations suggesting that washington was willing to move on if it can t get the deal it wants a substantive deal would require china to rethink the way it pursues its economic ambitions abandoning or scaling back subsidies to its companies easing up on the pressure for foreign companies to share trade secrets and giving them more access to the chinese market philip levy senior fellow at the chicago council on global affairs and a white house economist under president george w bush said the talks are too complicated for trump s high pressure tactics to work the president treats this like we re haggling over the price of a used car levy said trump has made a priority of shaking up american trade policy trump and chinese vice premier liu he left mt in the oval office last month during the previous round of trade talks politics watchers had expected a trump xi summit in the future to ink a deal china sends countless shipping containers like these 40 footers to the u s every year and the u s sends far less back in goods and services creating a 419 billion trade deficit last year alone as a candidate for the presidency trump raged repeatedly about alleged chinese perfidy so much so that a video mashup of him spitting out the word china went viral and collected more than 15 million views on youtube com trump charged that previous administrations gullible and weak had let china get away with abusive trade practices accepting empty promises from beijing and allowing the u s china economic relationship to grow ever more lopsided as evidence he pointed to america s vast u s trade deficit with china 379 billion last year by far the biggest with any country in the world once he took office trump s relationship with his chinese counterpart xi jinping seemed to get off to a good start the two men shared chocolate cake and amiable conversation at trump s resort in mar a lago florida in april 2017 a few weeks later china agreed to open its market u s beef cooked chicken and natural gas in what commerce secretary wilbur ross called a herculean accomplishment the romance faded in march 2018 the office of the u s trade representative issued a report accusing china of using predatory tactics to strengthen its tech companies last july the trump administration gradually began slapping import taxes on chinese goods to pressure beijing into changing its policies it now has imposed 10 tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports and 25 tariffs on another 50 billion the chinese have retaliated by targeting 110 billion in u s imports the fight between the world s two biggest economies is raising worries about global economic growth the international monetary fund the world bank and others have downgraded their forecasts for the world economy saying the u s china standoff is reducing world trade and creating uncertainty for companies trying to decide where to buy supplies build factories and make investments trump has portrayed his tariffs as a moneymaker for the united states and a benefit to the u s economy but a march study by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university found that the burden of trump s tariffs including taxes on steel aluminum solar panels and chinese imports falls entirely on u s consumers and businesses who buy imported products by the end of last year the study found they were paying 3 billion a month in higher taxes and absorbing 1 4 billion a month in lost efficiency nonetheless the overall u s economy has remained healthy on friday the government reported that the u s unemployment rate had fallen to the lowest level in half a century the prospect of higher tariffs and heightened tensions could alarm investors when markets open monday when the president puts his foot down it makes the market go down chris rupkey chief financial economist at mufg union bank wrote in a research note sunday tariff man is back just in time to make the stock market dive

adrianna defranco from first solar investor relations ms defranco you may begin adrianna defranco investor relations thank you good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today the company issued a press release announcing its first quarter 2019 financial results a copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on first solar s website at investor firstsolar com with me today are mark widmar chief executive officer and alex bradley chief financial officer mark will begin by providing a business and technology update alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter and provide updated guidance for 2019 following their remarks we will open the call for questions advertisement advertisement please note this call will include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management s current expectations we encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today s press release and presentation for a more complete description story continues it is now my pleasure to introduce mark widmar chief executive officer mark mark widmar chief executive officer thank you adrianna good afternoon and thank you for joining us today i would like to begin by briefly discussing our eps result for q1 as we emphasized on our february earnings call we expected that the combination of lower quarterly series 6 sales and the higher series 6 cost per watt relative to the full year average as well as the timing of both ramp and start up charges and the timing of project development sales would have the most acute impact to earnings in the first quarter our eps results for the quarter was in part driven by these factors however the first quarter was also adversely impacted by some unanticipated non series 6 related costs alex will go into more detail but one key area where we have seen significant recent challenges has been containing costs in our epc business these challenges include factors both external and internal to first solar advertisement advertisement externally a higher than expected construction labor market and certain equipment supply issues produced a drag on profitability at several of our systems projects we also encountered certain weather delays for which relief was not available under the epc contract which in turn put pressure on required milestones and other completion dates and correspondingly increased costs from an internal perspective our recent record of project cost management including subcontractor and vendor cost management failed to meet our expectations our epc capability delivers strategic value to the company but following a recent evaluation of these issues we determined that restructuring of the epc organization was prudent given these issues accordingly we have installed new leadership of the epc organization merging our energy systems function with the engineering procurement and construction group in addition we are reviewing certain supplier and subcontractor arrangements and potential remedies with a view to addressing certain of these costs turning briefly to the market catalysts driving increased pv penetration continued to point to a strong global demand in 2019 and momentum building thereafter for example in the u s there s a growing impetus to de carbonize electricity in the past months washington state joined california new mexico hawaii puerto rico and washington d c in an active legislation that mandates 100 clean electricity standard additionally over a dozen other states have here put in place non binding goals have introduced or are planning to introduce legislation with varying levels of clean energy commitments or are committing to studying clean alternatives to their power generation portfolios advertisement advertisement corporate buyers are also increasingly looking for ways to de carbonize their electricity this is reflected in the fast changing ppa landscape in the united states which has seen an evolution in buyer types and transaction structures we see a significant rise in corporate and commercial industrial ppa structures with large technology companies dominating the market but with growing interest from other sectors such as healthcare finance and even oil and gas as part of our focus to accelerate growth in this segment first solar has joined the board of the renewable energy buyers alliance which has committed to establishing a clear path to its members to procure zero carbon electricity this alliance s goal is to catalyze 60 gigawatts of new renewable energy for its members by 2025 internationally europe has continued on its growth trajectory with 2019 potentially being a record year for pv installations initially this year first solar celebrates 15 years in europe with approximately 5 gigawatts of installed capacity across the region this year we expect european growth to be largely powered by the resurgence of the utility scale market in spain driven by economics and favorable policy spain is expected to add significant new capacity over the next several years additionally france continues to procure utility scale solar as part of its grid program globally all indicators point to growth underpinned by a combination of competitive economics of solar and a desire to de carbonize electricity grids advertisement advertisement starting on slide 4 i ll provide an update on our series 6 capacity rollout as a reminder we began production of our first series 6 factory in april of 2018 since then we started production at three additional factories reflecting over this relatively short period of approximately one year and the significant progress we have made we are pleased with where we are at series 6 in terms of schedule performance and cost since the february earnings call we have seen significant operational improvements across our series 6 factory when comparing the performance of the month of february which includes the first full month of our production of our second vietnam factory to the performance of the month of april meaningful improvements can be seen despite certain planned downtime during the period megawatts produced per day is up 34 capacity utilization has increased 21 percentage points adjusted for planned downtime the april fleet capacity utilization was 90 we expect higher than normal planned downtime to continue over the next couple of quarters as we continue to operationalize the full entitlement of our factories production yield is up two percentage points to approximately 90 the average watt per module has increased slightly more than one bin or six watts and finally the percentage point of modules with anti reflective coating has increased by 15 percentage points and another noteworthy highlight relative to our series 6 production expansion is the success we have experienced ramping our second vietnam factory the ramp has been accelerated relative to previous factories by applying accumulated learnings including starting production with an improved module training tool this benefit can be seen when comparing the initial three months of production of our most recent vietnam factory to our first series 6 factory in ohio advertisement advertisement capacity utilization is 33 percentage points higher production yield is 32 percentage points higher average watts are up 19 watts or essentially four bins and the arc penetration is 48 percentage points higher leading to an equivalent watts produced being 125 higher the progress we have made ramping our factories has been a key contributor in enabling us to achieve our first quarter series 6 cost per watt objective while this is a significant accomplishment there is a tremendous amount of work still in front of us to achieve our cost per watt roadmap for the year as we noted in our february earnings call our expected series 6 cost per watt will drop approximately 30 from q1 to q4 these significant accomplishments can be credited to the outstanding work of our engineering and manufacturing associates construction is continuing in our second series 6 factory in ohio as announced previously we expect to start production in early 2020 and construction is thus far on track to our schedule with the first tools scheduled to be installed by the end of q2 once completed we will have five factories with an aggregate annual series 6 capacity of 5 4 gigawatts an impressive accomplishment since announcing the transition to series 6 in november of 2016 advertisement advertisement we continue to be encouraged by the progress we have made over the last year as noted previously we planned portfolio production of between 5 2 gigawatts and 5 5 gigawatts as a reminder this targeted production includes approximately two gigawatts of series 4 modules in order to meet these production commitments we continue to roll out two upgrades and optimize the production line throughput across the various sites this is a dynamic process that continues to incorporate learnings from each of the factories we have ramped and is moving according to schedule turning to slide 5 i ll next discuss our bookings activity since the last earnings call in total our net bookings since the last earnings call were 1 1 gigawatts after accounting for shipments of approximately 900 megawatts during the first quarter our expected future shipments are 12 2 gigawatts our most recent bookings are across multiple customers and include a limited volume of series 4 for delivery at the end of 2019 the remaining series 6 deliveries are split evenly between 2020 and 2021 in terms of geography approximately 900 megawatts of the 1 1 gigawatts is for delivery to the united states with the remaining 200 megawatts flexible across the u s and certain international markets with these recent bookings we have now added 2 3 gigawatts to the backlog since the beginning of the year we are pleased with this momentum to date and have increased confidence in exceeding our targeted 1 1 book to ship ratio in 2019 advertisement advertisement as we mentioned on our last earnings call we are largely sold out through the end of 2020 with the current bookings now 50 of the anticipated q1 2021 supply has been booked as a reminder given the timeframe for which we now have available product we may see future bookings in 2019 to be weighted toward the back end of the year slide 6 provides an updated view on our mid to late stage bookings opportunity which now totals 6 6 gigawatts dc a decrease of approximately 0 7 gigawatts from the prior quarter however when factoring in the bookings for the quarter approximately 0 3 of which were booked or were included in the opportunities in the prior quarter our mid to late stage pipeline declined by 0 4 gigawatts dc as a reminder our mid to late stage pipeline is reflective of those opportunities we feel could book within the next 12 months and is a subset of a much larger pipeline of opportunities which totals approximately 12 gigawatts this includes approximately two gigawatts of opportunities in 2019 and 2020 which will provide demand resiliency to our near term production while the remaining approximately 10 gigawatts of demand would be for module deliveries in 2021 and beyond in terms of geographical breakdown of the mid to late stage pipeline north america remains the region with the largest number of opportunities at 3 9 gigawatts dc europe represents approximately 2 gigawatts driven largely by resurgent markets in france and spain with the remainder being across the asia pacific region advertisement advertisement in terms of segment mix our mid to late stage pipeline includes approximately 900 megawatts of systems opportunities across the u s and japan with the remainder being module only sales i ll now turn the call over to alex to provide more detail on our first quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2019 alexander bradley chief financial officer thanks mark turning to slide 8 i ll start by covering the income statement highlights for the first quarter net sales in q1 was 532 million a decrease of 159 million compared to the prior quarter the lower net sales were primarily a result of lower systems projects revenue in the u s and japan partially offset by higher module segment revenue the percentage of total quarterly net sales of systems revenue in q1 was 63 as compared to 83 in q4 of 2018 gross margin was breakeven in q1 compared to 14 in the fourth quarter of 2018 the system segment gross margin was 8 in the first quarter and the module segment gross margin was negative 13 as a reminder module segment costs of sales comprise of all third party module cost of sales as well as series 6 ramp related costs which as mark mentioned earlier expected to be felt most acutely during the first half of the year we experienced ramp related charges of 36 million in the first quarter approximately 70 of the midpoint forecast for the full year the system segment gross margin was impacted by 35 million related to the epc business this includes approximately 20 million related to our projects with tampa electric which were built with our series 4 products challenge with these projects included tight construction schedules labor shortages non force majeure weather related work stoppages failure by high voltage transformer factory acceptance tests the financial distress of a major subcontractor and certain rework we ve had some higher than projected costs and incurred some liquidated damages for failure to meet certain milestones we had approximately 5 million of impact at our pv project for the inclusion of lower bid in series 6 modules a consequence of the earlier than expected start of our second vietnam factory products initially produced in january was held pending release of our quality review process this fully functional but lower bin non op product was used in our systems business as an alternative to scrapping it and incurring additional start up expense whilst this increased costs these are more than outweighed by the strategic value of having placed the second vietnam factory online earlier than previously forecasted providing optionality in terms of whip sharing across factories as well as the ability to run more engineering test sites work at our perrysburg site over the course of the year the remaining approximately 10 million impact to gross margin was across our other projects in construction and was a result of greater than projected balance of systems cost related to the installation of low bin modules higher than forecast labor costs and certain project specific construction costs operating expenses was 77 million in the first quarter a decrease of 10 million compared to q4 of 2018 this includes a reduction of 5 million in core sg a and r d spending and a 5 million reduction in plant start up expense which decreased from 15 million in q4 2018 to 10 million in q1 given the anticipated start up timing of our second factory in perrysburg we expect start up cost to increase each quarter over the remainder of the year we have an operating loss of 77 million in the first quarter compared to an operating profit of 11 million in the prior quarter the reduction in operating income was a result of lower systems revenue and a higher epc and ramp costs mentioned previously other income was 4 million in the first quarter primarily from the gain on sale of certain restricted investments associated with our module collection and recycling program partially offset by the impairment of a strategic investment for into perovskites technology despite providing us with valuable insights into the development of perovskites the investment was unable to hit certain internal milestones required for continued investment resulting in an impairment of 5 million in the quarter we took a mark to market charge of 5 million related to the fair value of certain interest rate swap contracts for some of our project assets in japan and australia this is a timing impact based on movement of interest rates within the quarter and we expect to see a corresponding increase in project value recorded at the time of sale we recorded a tax benefit of 1 million in the first quarter compared to a tax benefit of 4 million in q4 of 2018 combination of the aforementioned items led to a first quarter loss per share of 0 64 compared to earnings per share of 0 49 in the fourth quarter of 2018 to summarize the key p l themes from the quarter we had a mix of expected and unexpected as expected we had our lowest revenue quarter for the year our quarter with the lowest percentage of series 6 sales relative to total module sales the highest series 6 cost per watt relative to the full year average and the highest quarterly combined ramp related and start up expense not anticipated were the higher than forecast ramp and epc costs the perovskites investment impairment and interest rate related mark to market swap cost impacts referenced above i ll next turn to slide 9 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information our cash restricted cash and marketable securities balance ended the quarter at 2 3 billion a decrease of approximately 400 million from the prior quarter our net cash position decreased by approximately 500 million to 1 7 billion the decrease in our cash balance is primarily related to capital investments in series 6 manufacturing capacity series 6manufacturing ramp and associated with working capital inventory costs and the timing of cash receipts from certain systems project sales total debt at the end of the first quarter was 571 million compared to 467 million at the end of q4 of 2018 debt issuance was of course primarily associated with project development in japan and as a reminder all of our outstanding debt continues to be project related and will come off our balance sheet when the projects are sold net working capital in q1 which includes the change in non current project assets and excludes cash and marketable securities increased by 272 million versus the prior quarter change was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventories cash flows used in operations were 303 million in the first quarter primarily driven by the timing of systems business spend and cash receipts as well as increased spend ramping the series 6 module business and finally capital expenditures were 149 million in the first quarter compared to 129 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 as we continued series 6 capacity expansion continuing on to slide 10 i ll next discuss the updated assumptions associated with our 2019 guidance firstly our guidance continues to assume a back ended series 6 module sale profile with approximately 75 of series 6 third party module sales occurring in the second half of the year as well as a steep series 6 cost reduction profile over the year with q1 and q2 cost per watt approximately 30 and 5 respectively above the full year average secondly we continue to see ramp related and start up charges weighted approximately 60 for the first half of the year thirdly we assume the majority of system sales both in the u s and internationally will take place in the second half of the year with regards to our u s assets currently for sale in 2019 we continue to assume a full sale of these projects in 2019 with the majority of revenue being recognized by year end as highlighted on our last earnings call there remains uncertainty around both timing and value especially related to assets with offtake agreements with fce given the circumstances surrounding the bankruptcy of pg e recent developments in california have been positive and we re also pleased with the progress we ve made in the sale process however given the continuing uncertainty in the colorful market should the market not reflect what we believe to be appropriate risk profiles and value to these assets we would look to finance the assets and hold them on balance sheet through the period of uncertainty rather than selling our prices below what we believe to be fair value so while unlikely should this change in sales timing occur it could result in full year eps approximately 0 50 below the low end of the current guidance range and lastly in addition as highlighted in our december 2018 guidance call our guidance continues to not take into account any potential impact to the continued class action lawsuit filed in 2012 or any resolution of that lawsuit with these factors in mind we re updating our 2019 guidance as follows we are raising our net sales forecast to revised range of 3 5 billion to 3 7 billion this 250 million increase above our prior net sales guidance relates to both the modules and systems segments with respect to the module segment while total expected shipments for the year are unchanged the earlier than anticipated transfer of control of the modules sold results in revenue being recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019 was otherwise anticipated to be recognized in the next fiscal year with respect to the system segment we re projecting the earlier sale of certain development assets in the u s and japan driven by the opportunity to optimize exit valuations to these projects and reduce risk across the entirety of the global development portfolio our expected gross margin has been lowered by 150 basis points to a revised range of 18 to 19 the reduction is used to previously to discuss higher than projected epc costs incurred in q1 as well as an increase in projected series six ramp related costs the operating expense forecast has been lowered by 5 million to a revised range of 370 million to 390 million as a result of decreased plant start up expenditure now forecast to be 70 million to 80 million operating income and earnings per share guidance remain unchanged our net cash forecast has been increased by 100 million to 1 7 billion to 1 9 billion as a function of the timing of project sales and cash receipts as well as increased prepayments for third party modules being sold to enable itc safe harbor benefits capex and module shipment guidance numbers also remain unchanged and as discussed previously we expect the majority of earnings to be in the second half of the year with q2 close to breakeven and potentially in a loss position however the timing of project sales between quarters can have a material impact on the quarterly earnings profile finally i ll summarize the key messages from our call today on slide 11 firstly we continue to be pleased with our bookings momentum with year to date 2019 net bookings of approximately 2 3 gigawatts we continue to strengthen our contracted pipeline secondly we continue to make good progress on our series 6 capacity roadmap and remain on track for our combined series 4 and series 6 production target of 5 2 to 5 5 gigawatts and lastly we ve increased our full year revenue and cash guidance and maintained our full year eps range and with that we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions operator questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from ben kallo with baird your line is open ben kallo baird analyst hey thanks for taking my questions so first could you guys just talk about on the bookings side i think bookings were down sequentially but was that just on the epc side and can you talk about pricing on the new bookings there to the extent you can how they compare with maybe the last quarter when you talked to us mark widmar chief executive officer yeah so ben if you look at the bookings for the quarter its 1 1 gigawatts year to date bookings 2 3 right so and again the 1 1 that we re referencing it s just from the february earnings call so if you look at it for a two month period we booked 1 1 gigawatts for the first two months of the year we booked 1 3 kind of number 1 2 so they re very comparable and if you look at the momentum which we d say we carried if we carried that forward through the balance of the year we ll be booking somewhere close to seven gigawatts so i don t see really any slowdown in the momentum of bookings i feel it s a robust number to start off the year as we indicated i think at the start of year it s positioning us to exceed our targeted 1 to 1 book to bill ratio so that would point us to a number six gigawatts plus trends pointing us to north of that number which i think is a positive indicator of what s going on and continued momentum in the business asps i continue to be extremely pleased with asps the profile of the bookings the 1 1 relative to what we booked in the first two months of the year asps are steady they still have a three handle type of asp that we ve referenced before i know there s some indications in the market of pricing being much more aggressive than that we continue to be able to be patient given that we re sold out through the end of 2020 and now we re effectively 50 sold for the first quarter of 2021 we can be selective we can engage with customers we can make decisions on where to walk away we re not being held by volume overhang that we haven t already been committed to from a customer so that helps us tremendously in how we re engaging the market and actually have been very pleased with the corresponding pricing that we re realizing operator your next question comes from philip shen with roth capital partners your line is open philip shen roth capital partners analyst hey guys thanks for the questions first is around shipments of series 6 modules can you share how many megawatts you shipped in q1 and then what that ramp rate might be for q2 and then secondarily some of our recent checks suggest that you may be focusing some resources on three to five year cost out plan and capex reduction plan is there any truth around this are you having people that for example have been otherwise focused on near term capacity ramp up challenges now switch over to longer term opportunities in other words does this highlight potentially that you ve solved a lot of your near term issues and you have an ability to focus on the longer term or medium term set of problems or cost outs ahead thank you mark widmar chief executive officer so from a shipment standpoint i think we indicated that we shipped about 900 megawatts for the first quarter you can take from that that we got two gigawatts of series 4 think of it as being that profile being relatively linear so you get to a position of the shipment profile around 50 50 between the two maybe slightly more series 4 shipments than series 6 shipments the ramp profile is going to increase significantly the forecast for the year is 5 5 so we got about 4 5 gigawatts now shipped over the remainder of the year and again that entire ramp is associated with series 6 the series 4 profile is going to be consistent across each of the remaining quarters of the year phil i guess for the we are very happy we highlighted that on the call around the progress that the team has made for series 6 and we cannot take our eye off of it though we got to continue to stay focused from both a schedule standpoint performance standpoint and a cost standpoint so there s we haven t really come up for air yet we re starting off this quarter very well april has been a strong month the first day of may has in fact been a record for us with all of our plants performing extremely well we continue to have to take some amount of planned downtime which that planned downtime will adversely impact utilization rates but we ll as we currently see it going forward a lot of the major efforts that we need to take planned downtime have effectively happened now through the first four months of the year there s still efforts that will continue but a lot of the major lifting has been done so far at least what we currently have we currently anticipate but what i will tell you is that we never relax when it comes to how do we think about continue to take more costs out how do we think about capex how do we think about throughput and how do we try to capture our current nameplate capacity of a factory is 1 2 gigawatts we re continuing to challenge ourselves around how we do we get more throughput out of every factory one thing that i will say in that regard while it will be relatively small we are even our second factory in perrysburg that we ll launch we ll have some additional capex investments associated with it relatively nominal that will enable us to increase the throughputs from that factory once it s started up and we currently anticipated to be in 2020 we ll see the success of that effort and determine how quickly we roll out across the remaining fleet we ll also continue to challenge ourselves around how do we again optimize throughput across every factory and the benefit by doing that is you effectively are just it s variable costs so it has not only impact utilization and throughput benefits but you re now looking at your cost per watt of that incremental throughput as being more or less favorable cost and some de minimis capex not an overly significant commitment for the most part but there s tremendous leverage in value creation for us to do that have there been efforts where we re continuing to evolve those surely there are but i don t want anyone to take from this that we are taking our eye off at all on both from a schedule performance and a cost standpoint so a lot of work in front of us as it relates to series 6 and delivering against our commitments for the year operator your next question comes from jeff osborne with cowen company your line is open jeff osborne cowen and company analyst hey good afternoon guys just one clarification and then two quick questions mark i think you ve mentioned the pricing of the 2 3 gigawatts in backlog is all of that have a three handle as you said so that includes the one gigawatt for 2021 through 2023 that you announced last quarter mark widmar chief executive officer yes we re very happy with the profile of asps as they go across that horizon and yes we re seeing very good pricing from that standpoint i think when you look at the q if i m not mistaken for what truly was recognized in the and they ll come out tomorrow but what s truly been recognized in the first quarter calendar quarter the asp metric i think will effectively be the same they ll stay steady i think it s around 0 36 something in that range right alexander bradley chief financial officer yes if you do the math you ll see it stay at 0 36 and if you do the comparison to last quarter the incremental is going to show you actually booking at 0 40 per watt now as we know that s rounded for gigawatts and dollars billion so going to take that with things yourself but if you look at it today yes you re still going to see the backlog and module in bookings being averaged at 0 36 operator your next question comes from brian lee with goldman sachs your line is open brian lee goldman sachs analyst hey guys thanks for taking the questions i ll try to get two in here maybe first off just given the demand environment and the more stable pricing trends as of late across the industry just wondering if you can update us on your thought process around malaysia one and converting that from series 4 to 6 and then second question would just be around the new gross margin guidance just want to make sure i understand the ins and outs of that but it implies about 50 million is coming out alex you talked about 35 million of epc and then the incremental 10 million in ramp costs so all of the gross margin headwinds relative to the original guidance concentrated here in q1 results or am i being too cute there are there more cost impacts as you move through the year thanks guys alexander bradley chief financial officer yes i ll get the gross margin question so yes you re generally right that you re seeing the impacts in q1 it s about 35 million related to epc business and that 10 million of ramp 5 million of which is true increase for the year and 5 million of which is you can think of a move from start up to ramp and you see a corresponding reduction in start up of 5 million and that gets you that bridges you roughly from where we were to the new gross margin percent guidance mark widmar chief executive officer brian as it relates to the demand environment again we continue to be very happy with the demand that we re seeing here in the u s but globally as well we re happy with our pipeline and one of the things we try to bring into the mix this time was not just the early and mid stage pipeline or excuse me the mid to late stage pipeline but we brought the kind of the total pipeline in and highlighted that we have about 10 gigawatts of opportunities in different phases that are for 2021 and beyond so very encouraged with the team and our ability to continue to engage with customers and find those opportunities and our hit rates have been very good and i m happy with that as it relates to our last our first factory and actually which is currently not committed to our capacity plan our capacity roadmap includes about 6 6 gigawatts of series 6 which would have two factories in malaysia two in vietnam and two in the u s we haven t made a commitment yet on that last factory there s a handful of things that will weigh into our decision making one of them is still momentum around safe harbor and how long do we run series 4 so we could potentially even run series 4 into q1 of next year because as you know the safe harbor window allows for deliveries that go through april of 2020 so that could be a decision maker that will influence our timing and how we think through a conversion to the extent there s a conversion the other one that i think is important though is just anything we do will clearly be driven by market so as we continue to build our backlog that will give us more confidence the other one is i somewhat alluded to in what we re trying to do with our second factory in ohio one of the things we d like to do is optimize the footprint to capture as much capacity out of the existing production that we have before we make additional conversions because the capex per megawatt of volume is significantly lower by just debottlenecking incremental capex and existing capital versus a new brownfield type of conversion and entire equipment set and then obviously dealing with cost of ramp and everything else that goes along with that so there s a lot of moving pieces that will play into our mix in that regard we ll probably have a much better sense of where we are on that last factory in malaysia as we exit the end of this year we ll be probably getting better indication of what our plan will be for that facility operator we have a follow up question from the line of jeff osborne your line is open jeff osborne cowen and company analyst yes thank you i was just going to ask about the teco challenges how much of your backlog is in teco and are they placated with the resolution that you ve had mark widmar chief executive officer so the impact of the last project that we have is like hancock we ll be complete here as we exit this quarter so the items the portfolio has been largely built now constructed issued have been countered obviously reflected in our first quarter obviously we still have some remaining work to be done to complete the last project for tampa electric but we re only a matter of month or two out before that will be completed jeff osborne cowen and company analyst got it and then alex was very specific about q1 and q2 and cost of series 6 is there any change to that slide that you had multiple quarters as it relates to the second half of the year with the declines relative to the full year average alexander bradley chief financial officer yes that slide generally holds so and i think there s a question around capacity as well if you look at that that still holds so the decline in cost for the year going from 130 of the full year average down to minus 10 at the end of the year and then the production being about 75 weighted to the second half of the year in terms of module only series 6 sales still holds jeff osborne cowen and company analyst excellent that s all i had it appreciate you letting me ask more thank you operator your next question comes from julien dumoulin smith with bank of america merrill lynch your line is open julian smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good afternoon everyone wanted to follow up a little bit on the backlog question and understand a little bit how it fits with the some of the safe harboring activity to what extent are is some of the incremental hedging and locking in of sales just fulfillment and sort of extension of some of the initial safe harboring activities that you ve already committed to in 2019 or to what extent is this truly novel customers that aren t necessarily trying to lock in 2019 or following in on some of the 2019 safe harbor stuff they ve already done just want to understand the composition given the pricing discussion we have mark widmar chief executive officer so julien there s a good portion of and what we said of the 1 1 that was booked 900 of it was in the u s and a couple of hundred megawatts would be for projects outside of the u s potentially u s but most likely outside so the customer has opportunities both in u s and outside they have an option to determine which projects they want to use that for they re current they currently are envisioning international opportunities but that could change as well given that there s not much volume there s still some element of this that is somewhat tied to customers view of around safe harboring and they may already have in some cases the may already have volume that s on our books that enables them to safe harbor and now they re fulfilling kind of the period in the future which they need to complete the project so the 5 may already be in a part of the backlog portfolio that we ve already booked in prior year and now they re saying hey well i need to fill this opportunity out in 2021 and so we re engaging with the conversation for those deliveries so the way i look at it it s indirectly related to safe harbor because they re anchoring in with the safe harbor opportunity that s already in the backlog and now they re looking to complete that commitment with volumes that are going to be delivered in 2021 so the pricing isn t necessarily directly related so it s not that you would say these shipments have to happen now and therefore you re leveraging that window which in that window if something is being shipped between now in the safe harbor window asps are very strong and that s one reason why we are looking at potentially how long do we run series 4 because i think you can get to make economic of hence that make more sense there and but when you go beyond that window it s largely wasn t the competitive dynamics or alternative options that a customer may have for modules that could be delivered in 2021 and so the window can be more competitive and is more competitive than something that s going to be delivered between now and april of next year i think there s clear indication in the market that market is tight here in the u s especially through our higher efficiency higher performing product there s not as much model or mono perc in the marketplace during that horizon so you re seeing pretty far pricing unfortunately they don t have as much supply that allows us to play that in that window but when you go beyond that and you re delivering something in 2021 and it s our technology stands on its own competitive merits relative to other options our customers may have for deliveries in 2021 operator your next question comes from colin rusch with oppenheimer your line is open colin rusch oppenheimer analyst thanks so much guys can you talk a little bit about how far out you re booked at this point and how much capacity you re trying to sell over the next several quarters mark widmar chief executive officer so we are what i tried to indicate a little bit is that we re 50 booked now for a targeted capacity in the first quarter of 2021 and so if you look at our capacity roadmap it would basically tell you it s going to be series 6 2021 capacity of around 6 6 gigawatts you can kind of look at the profile of how much would be available in each quarter we re about 50 booked against that that s a great position to start the year off if i look at it across the entire year the numbers are closer to about a third 30 or so is actually booked at this point in time and against that we ve got if you look at our 10 gigawatts of opportunities 2021 both early as well as mid to late stage we ve got a lot of opportunity now that it starts filling in that window in 2021 now clearly we have some bookings as we mentioned on our last call that actually go out into 2023 but feel really encouraged by the opportunity set that s in front of us and continuing engagement that we re having with customers and hopefully as we progress the only real window we have a little bit of tail at the end of 2020 to deal with on series 6 but really the bookings as we go forward to the balance of this year and if we achieve our one to one or greater than one to one of course somewhere in the range of 6 or 6 5 gigawatts the remaining call it 4 gigawatts will start filling out that 2021 window relative to where we are right now if we can be successful doing that not all that will sit directly in 2021 but we ll be able to fulfill a big portion of that supply requirement by the end of this year if we re successful operator our final question will come from travis miller with morningstar your line is open travis miller morningstar analyst good afternoon thank you a bit of a higher level question here when we look out you talked about some of the policy momentum that certainly we re seeing across the industry more demand from outside of policy but if you look out kind of two to three years what do you see in the competitive landscape who do you see as competitors and do you see enough demand out there that perhaps you can fill all capacity and have pricing power in that market mark widmar chief executive officer the look there s a tremendous amount of momentum there are numerous catalysts that are driving the global opportunity for pv the issues the demand is going to continue to grow isn t any concern the real question is how much supply comes to the marketplace that s something i can t control if you look at longi now i think they re making commitments at the model wafer level i think going up to 65 gigawatts by 2021 which i think the last numbers that i remember were something closer to 45 yeah so those numbers they continue to add capacity and so it s hard to determine what s going to happen on the spot what we do though and what our objective is we need to create technology advantage in separation to have the lowest cost products in the marketplace and to have the highest energy entitlement that drives to a profit pool opportunity that we are able to capture that our competitors can t and that s what we continue to do we ve been successful doing that in the past the challenges in front of us are probably even greater than maybe they have been historically but that s why we made the decision to shift to series 6 which gives us the best potential position of strength and to grow this company and to capture scale and drive through and leveraging against our fixed operating cost and manage the business from continue to manage the business on a balanced business model of growth liquidity profitability and that s the core tenets of what we try to do and we re staying the course in that regard as we look across the horizon we feel very comfortable but we know this will continue to be a very challenging and demanding market operator this concludes today s conference call you may now disconnect duration 45 minutes call

inequality in the united states has reached such levels lately that even members of the one percent have started worrying ray dalio founder of bridgewater associates hedge fund who is ranked 57th wealthiest person in the world by forbes magazine quipped in a recent interview that capitalism is denying equal opportunity for the american dream he said that he was a byproduct of capitalism when it also gave equal opportunity adding i was very lucky to live the american dream by having the proper care and the proper public school education a number of things have changed former starbucks ceo and prospective presidential candidate howard schultz who prefers to be called a person of means rather than a billionaire ranked 617th by forbes recently observed that the vast majority of americans are living paycheck to paycheck and declared that the next us president must urgently address inequality ceo of jp morgan chase jamie dimon ranked 1 717th also noted earlier this year that a big chunk of have been left behind forty percent of americans make less than 15 an hour forty percent can t afford a 400 bill whether it s medical or fixing their car fifteen percent of americans make minimum wages 70 000 die from opioids indeed the growing impoverishment and despair that are plaguing our country are hard to miss the us also has the highest rate of income inequality among western nations with the top one percent claiming 40 percent of us wealth in 2016 in contrast to a 25 to 30 percent share in the 1980s according to the rather conservative estimates of the us census bureau around 14 percent of the population or 45 million live in poverty according to the un 8 5 million of them face extreme poverty and 5 3 million suffer in third world conditions of absolute poverty but in reality many more americans struggle to secure a dignified life for themselves and their families a damning report published by the un in 2018 found that high child and youth poverty rates perpetuate the intergenerational transmission of poverty very effectively and ensure that the american dream is rapidly becoming the american illusion the equality of opportunity which is so prized in theory is in practice a myth especially for minorities and women but also for many middle class white workers perhaps parts of the american one percent are finally ready to admit that socioeconomic inequality has reached unprecedented levels and that the current status quo is unsustainable because just like south african billionaire johann rupert the prospect of the poor masses rebelling is keeping them awake at night they are now saying that capitalism needs work and are proposing various fixes mainly trickle down philanthropy some have gone as far as suggesting that social provision should be enhanced and that the wealthy should be taxed yet all of them are quick to outright reject socialist policies in a recent interview for nbc melinda gates cochair of the bill and melinda gates foundation and wife of the second richest man in the world echoed the thoughts of many of the super rich saying that what i know to be true is i would far rather live in a capitalistic society than a socialist society but gates is wrong the current system in place in the us is not capitalism but rather socialism for the rich which favours the one percent by granting it ever increasing subsidies exorbitant tax breaks deregulation and executive bonuses the rest of the population lives in an unfair system of inequality and segregation struggling to make ends meet under severe austerity and erosion of labour rights it is a system of survival of the fittest which privileges some over the others based on race and gender economic growth now only uplifts the rich who are able to control the distribution of wealth by influencing the government and making sure it serves their interests and maintain their power through the us system of legalised corruption the wealthy funnel billions of dollars in donations to election campaigns unsurprisingly the stop gap fixes that people like gates dimon schultz and dalio are proposing are unlikely to work because they are designed to maintain the current system in place so they can continue to accumulate wealth unrestrained the only viable solution that would prevent a major socioeconomic disaster in the us and subsequent social upheaval would be to overhaul the system solutions to economic inequality and the excesses of american capitalism are necessary to save capitalism from itself or better yet to save people from capitalism there is an increasing number of dramatic proposals for economic justice that look promising these include congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez s green new deal which envisions a national mobilisation to eliminate carbon emissions and transform the us economy boosting economic growth and job creation while seeking economic and racial justice for vulnerable communities ocasio cortez has also called for a 70 percent marginal tax rate on earnings above 10m congresswoman elizabeth warren has a plan to wipe out 1 5 trillion in student loan debt by levying a surtax on the ultra rich while congressman bernie sanders has put forward a proposal for universal healthcare the idea of reparations for slavery which could help alleviate some of the racial inequality in the country is also gaining ground although conservatives attack proposals promoting economic justice and equity as dangerous because they could lead to a totalitarian socialist system such policies have long been a part of the us system after all the green new deal is named after the new deal which was introduced during the great depression to protect the poor strengthen labour rights and impose strict regulation on the financial system at the same time americans are increasingly in favour of a major overhaul of the system due to the problematic and corruptive nature of the current one existing and proposed government programmes of economic redistribution and equity are popular socialism is also gaining popularity even surpassing capitalism among democrats particularly millennials such policies which translate into more democratic ownership and control over the government and greater public accountability most certainly frighten the wealthy for their effectiveness and political popularity if members of the one percent truly care about the widening wealth gap they should not resist the implementation of these policies an overhaul of the system might make them less wealthy but ultimately will not be to their detriment a profit can still be made if workers are paid dignified salaries provided proper healthcare and granted social and labour rights indeed the choice of the one percent is reduced to either living in a more equal and just society or facing the wrath of angry impoverished masses the views expressed in this article are the author s own and do not necessarily reflect al

people based on their skills a growing number of businesses are listening in the past few years apple google ibm and other high profile companies have stripped the bachelor s degree requirement from many of their positions if this movement continues to gather steam researchers say it could aid not only individual job seekers but also the u s economy by helping businesses hold onto workers and by boosting the middle class degree inflation in 2014 the labor market analysis firm burning glass technologies tried to capture the extent of degree inflation the firm compared the percentage of people in a given occupation say executive assistant who have a bachelor s degree with the percentage of job listings for that occupation requiring a bachelor s degree who you have working for you and who you want to have working for you in the future aren t always the same said burning glass ceo matthew sigelman sigelman found that 19 percent of current executive assistants had a bachelor s degree but that 65 percent of job listings for the position asked for one a credentials gap of 46 percent in surveying broader groups of occupations burning glass found a credentials gap of 26 percent for management jobs 21 percent for computer and math jobs and 13 percent for sales jobs in late 2017 a research project led by the harvard business school a workforce organization called grads of life and the consulting firm accenture concluded in a report dismissed by degrees that employers appear to be closing off their access to the two thirds of the u s workforce that does not have a four year college degree the researchers estimated that 6 2 million jobs were at risk of degree inflation they cited research showing that the proportion of job listings requiring a four year degree increased by more than 10 percentage points from 2007 to 2010 that timespan should look familiar the great recession lasted from december 2007 to june 2009 unemployment spiked and employers stocked up on college graduates without having to pay a premium in wages some of that is legitimate where the job is getting more technical said dismissed by degrees co author joe fuller a harvard business school professor but employers want more than technical skills they want characteristics like attention to detail problem solving working with a team one of the major reasons degree inflation is so common is because employers use it as proxy for those kinds of soft skills fuller said related out of poverty into the middle class using a four year degree as a proxy for employability shuts out the most economically vulnerable job seekers it hurts employers too fuller and his harvard colleague researcher manjari raman found in their report degree holders command an 11 to 30 percent wage premium yet fail to justify that premium in productivity and other outcomes it takes longer to fill jobs when filtering for four year degrees and degree holders change jobs more quickly nonetheless according to harvard s survey of 600 business and human resource leaders 61 percent of respondents reported tossing resumes without four year degrees even if the applicant was qualified that survey also revealed that 63 percent of respondents had trouble filling middle skills jobs andy van kleunen ceo of the national skills coalition attributed that trouble to public policies that push bachelor s degrees as a one size fits all solution rather than training workers for specific middle skill positions the national skills coalition which lobbies policymakers and employers to invest in workers skills wants federal pell grants to be available not just for students seeking degrees but also for workers who want to take short term courses that they could apply on the job immediately but part of employers inability to fill middle skills jobs can be attributed to degree inflation fuller s report encouraged employers to push back against the trend once the logic of resisting degree inflation takes root in an organization it soon permeates different aspects of the organization s culture and eventually embeds itself at the heart of its strategy the report states a 1 percent market after years of being criticized for a lack of diversity companies especially in the technology world are looking for ways to make their workplaces more inclusive and a tight labor market there were more than 7 million job openings in the u s as of february has employers in many sectors scrambling for talent for decades at many companies that i worked for i wasn t allowed to hire unless somebody had a four year degree said trish torizzo the chief information officer for houghton mifflin harcourt but today she said supply is so low that people are almost being forced to think more creatively about how they operate houghton mifflin harcourt stripped the four year degree requirement from information technology positions including web developer last summer and the number of applications that made it through their initial screening doubled to screen candidates the company looks for a tech stack a list of programming languages and tools a candidate knows houghton mifflin harcourt then revisited hiring practices for sales positions which are heavy on soft skills at the urging of roberta rainville the vice president for talent acquisitions rainville knew it was time for a change when the company found itself unable to hire a great candidate for a sales position they interviewed splendidly she said and then it was well i want to hire them and i was like yeah you can t and they re like why not and i m like because your job description says bachelor s degree required i said that s got togo related are apprenticeships the new on ramps to good jobs rainville had to persuade 10 people from the sales leadership team before she could make the change some folks were like we can t take the bachelor s degree off we re sending the wrong message to our teacher population that we re selling to she said ultimately everyone signed off and in september the company stripped the four year degree requirement from some of its sales jobs and three months later did the same for software engineering jobs now 11 percent of applicants who make it through the interview process for an entry level sales position have no credential beyond a high school diploma another 11 percent have an associate degree

economic opportunity to bostonians who lack a four year degree more than 50 percent of adults in the city there is a huge amount of talent in this market that we are not talking to poole said when the time came for audience questions the first to speak up was delmar from resilient coders he asked a panel including city leaders researchers and executives a question that was met with silence followed by nervous laughter is it time will it ever be time to ban the b a requirement from coding jobs closing the gap with more than 20 four year colleges and universities boston is known as a college town but only 25 percent of the city s black and latino adults have a bachelor s degree and the boston metro area ranks sixth in the nation for income inequality the regional economy might be thriving but many of its jobs are taken by people who come from outside massachusetts when it comes to the labor market said marybeth campbell executive director of skillworks a workforce group dedicated to low income low skilled bostonians our two year community colleges are competing with our four year schools and those four year schools are competing with three or four schools here harvard mit the staff

president donald trump turned up the pressure on china on sunday threatening to hike tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese goods trump s comments delivered on twitter came as a chinese delegation was scheduled to resume talks in washington on wednesday aimed at resolving a trade war that has shaken financial markets and cast gloom over the world economy trump turned up the heat by saying he would raise import taxes on 200 billion in chinese products to 25 from 10 on friday he d twice pushed back deadlines in january and march to raise the tariffs in a bid to buy more time for a negotiated settlement but on sunday trump who has called himself a tariff man said he s losing patience the trade deal with china continues but too slowly as they attempt to renegotiate no trump tweeted in his tweets trump also threatened to slap tariffs on another 325 billion in chinese imports covering everything china ships annually to the united states the two countries are locked in a high stakes dispute over china s push to establish itself as a technological super power the u s charges that china is resorting to predatory tactics including cybertheft and forcing foreign companies to hand over technology in a drive to establish chinese companies as world leaders in advanced industries such as robotics and electric vehicles the administration has repeatedly suggested that the negotiators are making progress a month ago trump said that the two countries were rounding the turn and predicted that something monumental would be achieved in the next few weeks but last week treasury secretary steven mnuchin seemed to temper expectations suggesting that washington was willing to move on if it can t get the deal it wants a substantive deal would require china to rethink the way it pursues its economic ambitions abandoning or scaling back subsidies to its companies easing up on the pressure for foreign companies to share trade secrets and giving them more access to the chinese market philip levy senior fellow at the chicago council on global affairs and a white house economist under president george w bush said the talks are too complicated for trump s high pressure tactics to work the president treats this like we re haggling over the price of a used car levy said trump has made a priority of shaking up american trade policy as a candidate for the presidency trump raged repeatedly about alleged chinese perfidy so much so that a video mashup of him spitting out the word china went viral and collected more than 15 million views on youtube com trump charged that previous administrations gullible and weak had let china get away with abusive trade practices accepting empty promises from beijing and allowing the u s china economic relationship to grow ever more lopsided as evidence he pointed to america s vast u s trade deficit with china 379 billion last year by far the biggest with any country in the world once he took office trump s relationship with his chinese counterpart xi jinping seemed to get off to a good start the two men shared chocolate cake and amiable conversation at trump s resort in mar a lago florida in april 2017 a few weeks later china agreed to open its market u s beef cooked chicken and natural gas in what commerce secretary wilbur ross called a herculean accomplishment the romance faded in march 2018 the office of the u s trade representative issued a report accusing china of using predatory tactics to strengthen its tech companies last july the trump administration gradually began slapping import taxes on chinese goods to pressure beijing into changing its policies it now has imposed 10 tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports and 25 tariffs on another 50 billion the chinese have retaliated by targeting 110 billion in u s imports the fight between the world s two biggest economies is raising worries about global economic growth the international monetary fund the world bank and others have downgraded their forecasts for the world economy saying the u s china standoff is reducing world trade and creating uncertainty for companies trying to decide where to buy supplies build factories and make investments trump has portrayed his tariffs as a moneymaker for the united states and a benefit to the u s economy but a march study by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university found that the burden of trump s tariffs including taxes on steel aluminum solar panels and chinese imports falls entirely on u s consumers and businesses who buy imported products by the end of last year the study found they were paying 3 billion a month in higher taxes and absorbing 1 4 billion a month in lost efficiency nonetheless the overall u s economy has remained healthy on friday the government reported that the u s unemployment rate had fallen to the lowest level in half a century the prospect of higher tariffs and heightened tensions could alarm investors when markets open monday when the president puts his foot down it makes the market go down chris rupkey chief financial economist at mufg union bank wrote in a research note sunday tariff man is back just in time to make the stock market dive dive dive
as small business week approaches the nation s smallest companies in the aggregate are by many accounts doing fairly well they re not however thriving en masse in direct response to trump administration and republican policies small business hiring is erratic according to numbers released by payroll provider adp small businesses typically struggle to add jobs when the unemployment rate is very low as it is now at 3 8 they often can t pay as much as larger companies or offer the comparatively robust benefits that big companies do thereby leaving them at a disadvantage when workers are scarce meanwhile surveys by bank of america wells fargo capital one and the u s chamber of commerce and metlife show small business owners have been losing some of their optimism as doubts linger about the strength of the current economic expansion the new tax law has had a mixed impact on small businesses and the trade war that began with trump administration tariffs is hurting small manufacturers and retailers business is good ok but no different from how it s been throughout the bulk of this expansion says mark zandi chief economist with moody s analytics it s hard to argue that the president s policies have led to some kind of renaissance for small businesses that s going to mean great things forever the administration believes otherwise former small business administrator linda mcmahon in an opinion piece published last week on foxbusiness com credited the administration s policies for helping the economy and in turn small companies she noted that she met with small business owners throughout her sba tenure i don t need a spreadsheet to tell me the president s america first program of tax trade regulatory and energy reform is supercharging our economy says mcmahon who resigned last month to work on president donald trump s re election campaign i saw it and continue to see it with my own eyes and through the eyes of the hundreds of business leaders i have met in a letter released last month by the sba mid atlantic regional administrator michelle christian said we see small business owners taking advantage of the tax cuts and deregulation efforts led by president trump to invest in their companies and their employees by raising wages providing bonuses increasing benefits and creating more jobs the economy is strong and small businesses are thriving economists and industry group officials see administration and gop policies as having a mixed impact on small businesses how a company is affected depends on the policy and the business s individual circumstances but even if a company has benefited from one policy it might be hurt by another it s been one step forward and one step back says david french senior vice president of government relations at the industry group national retail federation a lot of the positive gains we ve seen out of tax reform have been given back in lost sales and lost opportunities because of higher tariffs the administration s tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of chinese and european products have sent costs higher for small businesses including manufacturers and retailers it can be a mistake to generalize about the companies that will be the focus of national small business week may 5 11 the expression small business is used to describe companies with relatively few employees and small revenues compared to large companies with thousands of workers and hundreds of millions or billions of dollars coming in annually but there is no typical small business a retailer dry cleaner restaurant manufacturer dental office or auto mechanic can be a small business because these companies have vastly different structures products and services they have widely divergent needs and priorities and government policies have a varying impact on them the tax law has had an uneven impact not all sole proprietors partners and owners of what are called s corporations can take a new 20 deduction against their business income the provision excludes some industries and depends on filing status for example an owner of a small business whose spouse had high earnings from a job or other source might not qualify for the deduction nor could many people with professional practices such as doctors architects and consultants and while the law lowered the maximum corporate tax rate to 21 from 35 the rate went up for many small corporations under the previous tax law sandra payne s construction equipment manufacturer had a 15 tax rate on the first 50 000 in income under the new law that rose to 21 that was huge to us it was a big deal says payne president of denver concrete vibrator in colorado michael rogers estimates he saved about 3 100 in taxes because he was able to claim the 20 deduction for what s known as qualified business income from his cleveland tennessee real estate company chandler properties but the money won t be reinvested in his business it will go to rogers family of four children overall it appears the tax law didn t help small businesses as much as the gop predicted in a bank of america survey of 1 504 small business owners released last week 28 said the government s tax policy has been positive for their companies down from the 45 who predicted a year ago it would be positive for them half said it was neutral up from 39 and 21 said the policy was negative for their companies up from 15 meanwhile although trump contends his trade policy is helping business billions of dollars in taxes on chinese and european imports and retaliatory tariffs on u s goods have driven up prices for small companies and their customers in the federal reserve s most recent beige book its assessment of regional economies eight of the 12 regional fed banks reported businesses were affected by or concerned about tariffs that run as high as 25 on some products while the april 17 report did not identify any of the companies as small businesses it does show tariffs are an ongoing issue the tariffs are also negating some tax benefits under the new law the nrf s french says if retailers benefit by consumers having more disposable income to spend a portion of that disposable income has gone to tariffs he says in a report released by the federal reserve bank of san francisco in february researchers found that tariffs already in place on chinese imports have added 0 1 percentage point to consumer price inflation a relatively small amount and that the contribution of chinese imports to overall personal consumption and business investment are also small however the report said when faced with tariffs as high as 25 on a broad set of product categories even these small shares can lead to sizable upward pressures on prices payne s company which uses steel and other raw materials that have been hit by tariffs is paying higher prices to suppliers all of our vendors are getting ready or have already increased prices in anticipation of the tariff issues she says the u s economy grew at a solid 3 2 in the first three months of the year but economists don t expect the current april june quarter to match that performance many are looking for gross domestic product growth to slow to around an annual rate of 2 in the current quarter a weakening economy can lead to a drop in hiring which has been inconsistent at small businesses while adp counted 77 000 new small business jobs in april and 20 000 in march that compared to an average 52 000 per month in 2018 although many businesses say they re unable to find skilled workers a problem zandi says is exacerbated by the administration s immigration policies some business owners have said they re cautious about taking on the added expense of new hires

new york as small business week starts today the nation s smallest companies in the aggregate are by many accounts doing fairly well they re not however thriving en masse in direct response to trump administration and republican policies small business hiring is erratic according to numbers released by payroll provider adp small businesses typically struggle to add jobs when the unemployment rate is very low as it is now at 3 8 they often can t pay as much as larger companies or offer the comparatively robust benefits that big companies do thereby leaving them at a disadvantage when workers are scarce meanwhile surveys by bank of america wells fargo capital one and the u s chamber of commerce and metlife show small business owners have been losing some of their optimism as doubts linger about the strength of the current economic expansion the new tax law has had a mixed impact on small businesses and the trade war that began with trump administration tariffs is hurting small manufacturers and retailers business is good ok but no different from how it s been throughout the bulk of this expansion said mark zandi chief economist with moody s analytics it s hard to argue that the president s policies have led to some kind of renaissance for small businesses that s going to mean great things forever the administration thinks otherwise former small business administrator linda mcmahon in an opinion piece published last week on foxbusiness com credited the administration s policies for helping the economy and in turn small companies she noted that she met with small business owners throughout her sba tenure i don t need a spreadsheet to tell me the president s america first program of tax trade regulatory and energy reform is supercharging our economy said mcmahon who resigned last month to work on president donald trump s re election campaign i saw it and continue to see it with my own eyes and through the eyes of the hundreds of business leaders i have met in a letter released last month by the sba mid atlantic regional administrator michelle christian said we see small business owners taking advantage of the tax cuts and deregulation efforts led by president trump to invest in their companies and their employees by raising wages providing bonuses increasing benefits and creating more jobs the economy is strong and small businesses are thriving economists and industry group officials see administration and gop policies as having a mixed impact on small businesses how a company is affected depends on the policy and the business s individual circumstances but even if a company has benefited from one policy it might be hurt by another it s been one step forward and one step back said david french senior vice president of government relations at the industry group national retail federation a lot of the positive gains we ve seen out of tax reform have been given back in lost sales and lost opportunities because of higher tariffs the administration s tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of chinese and european products have sent costs higher for small businesses including manufacturers and retailers it can be a mistake to generalize about the companies that will be the focus of national small business week may 5 11 the expression small business is used to describe companies with relatively few employees and small revenues compared to large companies with thousands of workers and hundreds of millions or billions of dollars coming in annually but there is no typical small business a retailer dry cleaner restaurant manufacturer dental office or auto mechanic can be a small business because these companies have vastly different structures products and services they have widely divergent needs and priorities and government policies have a varying impact on them the tax law has had an uneven impact not all sole proprietors partners and owners of what are called s corporations can take a new 20 deduction against their business income the provision excludes some industries and depends on filing status for example an owner of a small business whose spouse had high earnings from a job or other source might not qualify for the deduction nor could many people with professional practices such as doctors architects and consultants and while the law lowered the maximum corporate tax rate to 21 from 35 the rate went up for many small corporations under the previous tax law sandra payne s construction equipment manufacturer had a 15 tax rate on the first 50 000 in income under the new law that rose to 21 that was huge to us it was a big deal says payne president of denver concrete vibrator in colorado michael rogers estimates he saved about 3 100 in taxes because he was able to claim the 20 deduction for what s known as qualified business income from his cleveland tennessee real estate company chandler properties but the money won t be reinvested in his business it will go to rogers family of four children overall it appears the tax law didn t help small businesses as much as the gop predicted in a bank of america survey of 1 504 small business owners released last week 28 said the government s tax policy has been positive for their companies down from the 45 who predicted a year ago it would be positive for them half said it was neutral up from 39 and 21 said the policy was negative for their companies up from 15 meanwhile although trump contends his trade policy is helping business billions of dollars in taxes on chinese and european imports and retaliatory tariffs on u s goods have driven up prices for small companies and their customers in the federal reserve s most recent beige book its assessment of regional economies eight of the 12 regional fed banks reported businesses were affected by or concerned about tariffs that run as high as 25 on some products while the april 17 report did not identify any of the companies as small businesses it does show tariffs are an ongoing issue the tariffs are also negating some tax benefits under the new law the nrf s french says if retailers benefit by consumers having more disposable income to spend a portion of that disposable income has gone to tariffs he says in a report released by the federal reserve bank of san francisco in february researchers found that tariffs already in place on chinese imports have added 0 1 percentage point to consumer price inflation a relatively small amount and that the contribution of chinese imports to overall personal consumption and business investment are also small however the report said when faced with tariffs as high as 25 on a broad set of product categories even these small shares can lead to sizable upward pressures on prices payne s company which uses steel and other raw materials that have been hit by tariffs is paying higher prices to suppliers all of our vendors are getting ready or have already increased prices in anticipation of the tariff issues she says the u s economy grew at a solid 3 2 in the first three months of the year but economists don t expect the current april june quarter to match that performance many are looking for gross domestic product growth to slow to around an annual rate of 2 in the current quarter a weakening economy can lead to a drop in hiring which has been inconsistent at small businesses while adp counted 77 000 new small business jobs in april and 20 000 in march that compared to an average 52 000 per month in 2018 although many businesses say they re unable to find skilled workers a problem zandi says is exacerbated by the administration s immigration policies some business owners have said they re cautious about taking on the added expense of new hires

economic analysts including the white house s own economic adviser appeared baffled by president donald trump s china tariff claim sunday morning that the u s economy is doing well because china and not u s companies are paying billions in tariff costs economic analysts including the white house s own economic adviser appeared baffled by president donald trump s china tariff claim sunday morning that the u s economy is doing well because china and not u s companies are paying billions in tariff costs economic analysts including the white house s own adviser appeared baffled by president donald trump s claim sunday morning that the u s economy is doing well because of tariffs placed on chinese imports and his assertion that china and not u s companies have paid billions because of these tariffs trump tweeted that china has been paying tariffs to the usa of 25 percent on 50 billion of high tech and 10 percent on 200 billion of other traded goods he vowed to raise that percentage higher this coming friday as part of his administration s ongoing trade war with china however economists and journalists immediately pounced on the claim detailing how trump s tariffs are in fact largely paid by u s importers of those affected chinese goods in the past trump and several white house advisers had argued the tariffs are more of a negotiating tactic with china rather than as he claimed sunday a way to achieve a direct economic boost as the tax policy center points out neither china s government nor chinese companies pay on u s tariffs on chinese imports instead the u s based companies that import these goods pay the additional money and often end up passing these costs onto american consumers or be faced with lowering their own profit margins in february researchers from princeton university columbia university and the federal reserve bank of new york released a paper concluding that the cost of the trump administration tariffs have been almost entirely passed through into domestic prices similarly researchers from the federal reserve bank of san francisco in february concluded that while the contribution of chinese imports to overall personal consumption and business investment may appear small the impact of tariffs as high as 25 percent on a broad range of products can still lead to sizable upward pressures on prices if all imports from china become subject to a 25 tariff our estimates show the overall short term direct effect on consumer prices and business investment price inflation would increase 0 4 percentage point and 1 4 percentage points respectively wrote the san francisco fed researchers in their paper this research showing that americans and not china ultimately pay for tariffs appears to run counter to the president s claims from sunday morning for 10 months china has been paying tariffs to the usa of 25 on 50 billion dollars of high tech and 10 on 200 billion dollars of other goods these payments are partially responsible for our great economic results the 10 will go up to 25 on friday 325 billions dollars trump tweeted sunday for 10 months china has been paying tariffs to the usa of 25 on 50 billion dollars of high tech and 10 on 200 billion dollars of other goods these payments are partially responsible for our great economic results the 10 will go up to 25 on friday 325 billions dollars donald j trump realdonaldtrump may 5 2019 he continued of additional goods sent to us by china remain untaxed but will be shortly at a rate of 25 the tariffs paid to the usa have had little impact on product cost mostly borne by china the trade deal with china continues but too slowly as they attempt to renegotiate no on twitter several economic analysts and journalists continued calling out trump s apparent reversal of how trade tariffs work china doesn t pay the tariffs american consumers pay the tariffs wrote new york magazine s josh barro for some reason i m feeling a sudden urge to tweet this explanation of who pays tariffs spoiler alert it s not china tweeted the washington post s karen tumulty trump wasn t the only person getting fact checked sunday morning by economic analysts over his inversion of how tariffs work an adviser in his own white house director of the u s national economic council larry kudlow appeared on fox news where anchor leland vittert confronted ludlow with his own 2011 words about a chinese tariff battle vittert who the president has previously called out for being critical of him read back kudlow s previous comments which appear to contradict trump s policies if you impose chinese import tariffs your consumers are going to suffer from higher prices and lower living standards kudlow said in 2011 regarding the obama administration confronted by his own words kudlow pivoted to defending the trump tariffs as a negotiation tool uh 2011 okay i ll take your word for it kudlow began look i m a free trade guy the president s tariffs however have been extremely useful in negotating they have brought china to the table we believe china needs to deal more than we do there are always some costs with these tariffs they re very minor costs in the u s a farmers and we help them out okay ludlow continued u s trade representative robert lighthizer and treasury secretary steven mnuchin are set to travel to beijing this week in a final push for trade talks the trump administration s demand for an enforcement tool on any agreement has been a stumbling block between the two governments kudlow continued what he s suggesting here is we have these talks this week we ll see how it clarifies but the president is i think issuing a warning here we bent over backwards earlier if the talks don t work out we ve made great progress structural issues and enforcement issues remain i want to be very careful here we ve made great progress and we want to be optimistic but if it doesn t work then i think what the president is sayign in today s tweet that we will continue the tariffs we believe that s in the best interest of the united states kudlow also demanded that china end what he called an unfair non reciprocal trading system accusing the country of breaking the law last week kudlow said during an appearance on fox business that the u s economy is killing it despite the ongoing trade spat

washington u s employers added a robust 263 000 jobs in april suggesting that businesses have shrugged off earlier concerns that the economy might slow this year and now anticipate strong customer demand the unemployment rate fell to a five decade low of 3 6 from 3 8 though that drop reflected a rise in the number of people who stopped looking for work average hourly pay rose 3 2 from 12 months earlier a healthy increase that matched the increase in march friday s jobs report from the labor department showed that solid economic growth is still encouraging strong hiring nearly a decade into the economy s recovery from the great recession the economic expansion is set to become the longest in history in july advertisement the broader economy remains on solid footing meaning that coming months will see continued job gains and faster wage growth said richard moody chief economist at regions financial corp trump administration officials insisted that the job market s gains were a result of the president s tax cuts and deregulatory policies we have entered a very strong and durable prosperity cycle said larry kudlow director of the white house s national economic council president donald trump has also pressed the federal reserve to cut short term interest rates because inflation remains low but most economists said the healthy jobs picture against the backdrop of low inflation would reinforce the fed s current wait and see approach the fed raised rates four times last year but has signaled that it doesn t foresee any rate increases this year stock investors welcomed friday s jobs data the dow jones industrial average rose 135 points or 0 5 in mid day trading the brightening economic picture represents a sharp improvement from the start of the year advertisement at the time the government was enduring a partial shutdown the stock market had plunged trade tensions between the united states and china were flaring and the fed had just raised short term rates in december analysts worried that the economy might barely expand in the first three months of the year yet the outlook soon brightened chair jerome powell signaled that the fed would put rate hikes on hold trade negotiations between the u s and china made some progress the economic outlook in some other major economies improved share prices rebounded and in the end the government reported that the u s economy grew at a 3 2 annual rate in the january march period the strongest pace for a first quarter since 2015 that said the growth was led mostly by factors that could prove temporary a restocking of inventories in warehouses and on store shelves and a narrowing of the u s trade deficit by contrast consumer spending and business investment which more closely reflect the economy s underlying strength were relatively weak but american households have become more confident since the winter and are ramping up spending consumer spending surged in march by the most in nearly a decade a likely factor is that steady job growth and solid wage increases have enlarged americans paychecks businesses are also spending more freely orders to u s factories for long lasting capital goods jumped in march by the most in eight months that suggested that companies were buying more computers machinery and other equipment to keep up with growing customer demand many businesses say they re struggling to find workers yet each month they seem to add a substantial number some have taken a range of steps to fill jobs including training more entry level workers loosening educational requirements and raising pay sharply years of steady hiring have sharply lowered unemployment for a range of population groups the unemployment rate for women fell last month to 3 1 the lowest point since 1953 the rate for latinos dropped to 4 2 a record low since 1973 when the government began tracking the data for asians joblessness has matched a record low of 2 2 and the unemployment rate for veterans of the iraq and afghan wars dropped to 1 7 also a record low advertisement most of last month s job growth occurred in services which includes both higher paying jobs in information technology and lower paying temporary work manufacturers added just 4 000 jobs construction firms gained 33 000 mostly on public infrastructure projects professional and business services which include it networking jobs as well as accountants and engineers led the gains with 76 000 education and health care added 62 000 jobs while a category that mostly includes restaurants and hotels gained 34 000 retailers however continued to cut jobs shedding 12 000 in april the third straight months of cuts the sector has eliminated 49 000 jobs in the past year even as the economy has picked up retailers are suffering from broader changes in the economy as more americans are shopping online and stores close after decades of overexpansion also to blame is an aging u s population that no longer needs to buy as much clothing and other goods

people in job training and education we need to end private prisons and private detention facilities corporations should not be making money locking people up sanders also favors decriminalizing and legalizing marijuana he also claimed that about 400 000 of those locked up have done nothing we need to get rid of the cash bail system he said he told the audience he favors various immigration reforms including changing the policy for those claiming refugee status at the border and giving legal status to the so called dreamers eligible for the daca program america must never be the country that snatches babies from their mothers he said before taking questions sanders spoke out against the health insurance industry and pharmaceutical industry and assured the audience that he supports free tuition for state universities one audience member related his negative experience with the affordable care act he said that in spite of paying thousands in premiums when his wife incurred 11 000 in medical bills in one year the policy paid nothing when you run out of rich people who are you going to tax he asked sanders did not address the problems with aca instead he repeated several of his previous talking points when you get rid of the profiteering of the drug and insurance companies even if you have insurance they work overtime to deny that claim he said when you have a simple system costs go down steve bakken of blue earth minnesota has made seeing all of the candidates and getting a selfie with them a project this is my 10th one he said i ve drawn a 130 mile circle from blue earth if they sail into this vortex i drive down and meet them after sanders talk bakken found himself agreeing with him on several points but found several others impractical he s not going to make the rich pay more bakken said he s just not going to do that he also finds sanders at 77 a little old for the job he s an old man like me bakken said i just don t think he has the energy for the rigors of what it takes to be president we need a younger person for the job no matter what their views
with more rain forecast for this week over much of the wool producing areas one can only hope that we are able to get a bit of pasture growth happening before soil temperatures decline too much the bureau of meteorology is still pointing to a 70 per cent chance of another el nino event however thankfully it is also saying it will be short lived if it does occur that may well lead to a dryish spring and possibly a wet summer which will not be ideal for the rebuilding of the australian wool flock but at current returns growers are very likely to persist with even the old girls
washington a college degree has long been a ticket to the u s middle class it typically confers higher pay stronger job security greater home ownership and comparatively stable households those benefits have long been seen as worth the sacrifices often required from deferred income to student debt yet college graduates aren t as likely as they once were to feel they belong to the middle class according to a collaborative analysis of the 2018 general social survey by the associated press norc center for public affairs research and gss staff the survey found that 35 of graduates described themselves as working or lower class up from just 20 who felt that way in 1983 by contrast only 64 of college grads say they feel they belong to the middle or upper class the findings might seem surprising given that the nearly decade long u s economic expansion is on the verge of becoming the longest on record and unemployment is an ultra low 3 8 percent yet the financial insecurities that afflict many college graduates point to the widening gap between the richest americans and everyone else dan black an economist at the university of chicago suggested that the consequences of the trend could include delayed family formation lower levels of consumer spending and eventually slower economic growth concerns like this will definitely have impacts for the economy black said the survey shows that americans both college graduates and those without degrees have broadly benefited as the country healed from the great recession which ended in 2009 but across age groups a college degree has become less of an assurance of upward mobility college graduates ages 50 and over as well as those under 35 are less likely than they were in 1993 to describe themselves as middle or upper class not surprisingly americans without a college degree have long felt even less connected to the middle class last year six in 10 of them described themselves as working or lower class about the same as the proportion who said so in 1983 the survey didn t define middle class respondents replied based on their own perceptions all of which suggests that while college still offers a path upward that route has been narrowed by student debt loads an outpacing of home prices relative to wages and widening economic inequality the income disparities go well beyond the gap between the top 1 of earners and all other households disparities are widening even within many occupations including financial advisers lawyers and physicians the result is that an ostensibly middle class job title may provide a pay level more associated with a lower middle class job the survey finds that americans satisfaction with their personal finances has finally regained its pre recession levels even though this hasn t led to increased identification with the middle class both people who have graduated from college and those who haven t are now as likely as they were before the recession to say their financial situations have improved in the past year but americans are also more likely than they were before the recession to say they feel overworked college graduates are likelier than those without degrees to say they work overtime 80 to 70 and that they have more work to do than they can complete 40 to 30 among college graduates who feel untethered from the middle class is justin provo of chicago at age 28 provo says student debt has inhibited his path to the middle class he borrowed a total of 58 000 to graduate in 2017 from roosevelt university with a degree in economics and philosophy now a portfolio manager for a mortgage servicing company he says his income based loan repayment plan isn t enough to fully cover the interest on his loans so his debt load keeps rising even though provo is making his regular loan payments just last week he received a real estate license in hopes of earning extra income to reduce his debts i m chipping at marble with a spoon provo said i m making some progress but i don t feel like i m getting anywhere all told student debt totals roughly 1 5 trillion a more than five fold increase since 2004 according to the federal reserve bank of new york to help manage the burden many parents and older family members have borrowed to fund their children s educations fed researchers concluded that the increase in education debt between 2005 and 2014 has prevented home ownership for roughly 400 000 young people at the same time many surveys show that student debt has also delayed marriages and household formation the problem has emerged as an issue for the 2020 presidential election with multiple democratic candidates most prominently sen elizabeth warren calling for some form of student debt forgiveness economists have noted that rising college debt has in effect become an entry fee for the job market nearly 80 of the net 2 million job gains last year went to college graduates even though just a third of adults hold a degree but roughly 60 of college graduates in 2017 had student loans with the average borrower leaving college with about 30 000 in debt according to the college board young people are facing unprecedented challenges that are preventing them from achieving what we all consider to be the american dream said soncia coleman a senior director at young invincibles an advocacy group for millennials they need the education but the cost to get it is astronomical what s more disparities in pay have widened within individual job categories over the past decade according to an analysis by martha gimbel research director at indeed com the jobs site using data from the bureau of labor statistics gimbel studied the gap between what the top 10 of a profession earned compared with the bottom 10 gimbel found that the most unequal incomes now exist among financial services sales agents medical doctors and real estate agents education race gender and age were relatively minor factors in the worsening wage equality within occupations among the more influential factors were the likelihood that workers are paid with bonuses a concentration of high pay among superstar performers and unequal profits among employers a computer programmer at apple for example would be paid substantially more than a programmer for a much smaller or less profitable employer the top 10 of america s lawyers earned more than 208 000 last year which makes the profession look extremely lucrative but the bottom 10 earned less than 58 200 an income that could make it difficult to repay law school debt people might seek to become a lawyer doctor or financial adviser because they see big salaries gimbel said but there is a lot of range in what those workers make they need to remember that they could be one of the unsuccessful lawyers or real estate brokers
the rural data journalism project is a cooperative of journalists and data scientists focused on topics that matter to rural communities the project team includes former post standard journalists richard sullivan tom foster and lori duffy foster the ripley central school district tucked away in a quiet corner of western new york state near the banks of lake erie served more than 500 students in 1994 today only 137 students are enrolled in the district a loss of about 73 percent some of that loss was intentional ripley pays to send its 100 high schoolers elsewhere so they will have more and better opportunities it is a solution that is attracting attention in a state where enrollment in rural districts has declined steadily over the past 25 years they are still our kids so we are still invested in their successes said paul mccutcheon president of the ripley school board it works like a regional high school probably would rural migration is a disturbing trend for those concerned about equality in education in new york state economics and natural change are to blame for the decrease in rural populations nationwide according to an analysis by the u s department of agriculture but in new york s school districts where two thirds of nonfederal funding comes from local property taxes the impact is particularly intense even the brightest students in rural schools find it hard to compete for employment and college admissions with students from more populated areas where advanced classes and electives are plentiful experts say the kind of educational programming and the breadth of curriculum you get is far too dependent on what the community itself can afford said david little executive director of the rural schools association of new york state that s exactly the opposite of the way it is in virtually every other state in the union most states pay two thirds the cost of education and the one third that locality pays for is really kind of curriculum enhancement when economies decline so do property tax revenues fewer students and less local money means fewer opportunities while their peers in urban and suburban school districts can choose from full menus of advanced placement honors and college courses many rural school districts can offer only a select few foreign language courses are often limited to one or two choices classes like dance theater and photography are nearly unheard of those limited options can make students less appealing to colleges and universities little said his own son was rejected by his dream college because his high school did not offer the electives they were looking for it is kind of this downward spiral that we are only now economically starting to get out of little said and until the state recognizes that these communities have a burden that s far too dramatic for them to overcome on their own and the state agrees to alter the way that it funds public education we won t stop the spiral the state education department declined interview requests for this story instead issuing a statement that says it is committed to ensuring all students thrive and succeed the state received 1 6 billion in federal funds under the every student succeeds act to work on such strategies beginning in the spring of 2018 according to the statement of that money 80 million is earmarked for improvements and programs in the state s lowest performing districts which includes rural schools above all our essa plan emphasizes the importance of fostering equity in education for all of new york s students and one of the most important ways we do this by incentivizing districts to provide opportunities to all high school students to engage in advanced coursework that is often unavailable in smaller rural school districts according to the statement little said the state s plans for the federal grant money give him hope but he noted that new york city as a high needs district will likely get half of the 80 million designated for program improvements leaving only 40 million for the 320 rural districts that need it even if the money is well used the impact will not be great enough he said like little many experts agree that the long term solution is to change the way public schools are funded in new york state in the meantime however rural communities are getting creative they are experimenting with regional high schools community school districts and distance learning programs that offer students more options they are working with local colleges and businesses to provide more jobs and train students for existing jobs they are evolving in order to survive and ripley has taken the lead we had reached a point where we couldn t sustain what we needed to for a high school in terms of giving students educational options mccutcheon said we had the bare necessities but it was really difficult to have any kind of electives programs because we didn t have enough student body and enough tax base really to have a successful high school program in 2013 ripley eliminated its high school classes and began paying tuition for its students to attend nearby chautauqua lake central high school its students now have access to college courses electives such as mandarin chinese and television production and a variety of stem classes the two districts share administrative services as well such as a transportation supervisor and a building manager despite the enrollment loss ripley s halls are far from empty to fill the void ripley leases office space to the town at cost the district has also opened up its building to the community housing a local food pantry and maintaining a fitness center that is free to residents the usda s department of economic research studies population migration their research reveals two major forces behind population decline in rural areas the economy is one factor jobs are harder to find in rural areas making urban and suburban areas more attractive especially to recent college graduates the second reason is natural change elderly residents are dying at typical rates but young people are having fewer babies recent statistics show slight increases in natural change in the past two years offering some hope that losses overall will at least slow down little said new york s rural districts have been particularly hard hit in the past seven years he believes the state s high taxes are not only driving people out of rural areas but out of the state as a whole worsening the problem if i come out of college and i am in a rural area i not only have very few economic opportunities within a rural area to come back home to but i also have to be willing in addition to my student loans to accept higher taxes and the higher debt load that will ensure that my taxes are higher going into the future he said little s organization is lobbying for an overhaul in the state funding system but that will not help today s students so districts are exploring and implementing short term solutions mergers once a popular answer to the problem have mostly failed in recent years community schools and distance learning program are gaining popularity the concept of regional high schools has been tossed around for years but the state has done little to promote it said bob lowry deputy director of the state s council of school superintendents under a regional high school system participating districts would retain their elementary and middle schools but would pick one building to serve all the area s high school students such systems are popular in other states and have been successful in parts of long island little said it really has the opportunity to transform rural new york he said regional high schools would be supported by all involved districts the concept is similar to that of the state s board of cooperative educational services which provides shared educational services and programs to school districts mostly in special education and career and technical education each region has its own boces and each participating district has a representative on the boces school board districts decide each year what services they need and then pay for those services out of their annual budgets ripley s solution differs from the regional high school concept in that district residents have no representation on the chautauqua lake school board the district pays nearly 8 000 per student each year ripley has no official say in class offerings policy decisions or any other issues related to chautauqua lake high school the state s teachers union has traditionally opposed the creation of regional high schools lowry said teachers fear that merged high schools will lead to job losses he said we ve already had the loss of jobs lowry said now we are trying to save jobs and expand the curriculum we need every teacher we can get matthew hamilton spokesperson for new york state united teachers declined to comment specifically on the union s position on regional schools don carlisto dean of students for saranac lake s middle school sits on the nysut board of directors and is president of the saranac lake chapter he said mergers and regional schools can succeed when all parties work together to do what is best for kids teachers and residents carlisto pointed to a recent merger of the elizabethtown lewis and westport central districts as an example i think that we would be doing a disservice if we just sort of had this reflexive kind of knee jerk reaction that the teachers union are obstructionists carlisto said there are always going to be obstructionists there are plenty of examples that i can cite where teachers unions are at the table with communities sort of moving issues forward saranac lake s enrollment has dropped almost 35 percent since 1994 forcing the closing of all but one neighborhood elementary school the district is already the state s largest at more than 600 square miles some students sit on buses for more than an hour each way merging with another district would be impractical saranac lake has instead adopted the community schools concept with the support of the teachers union the superintendent and the school board carlisto said community schools attempt to stave off migration by making rural life more appealing and more feasible schools become community centers offering everything from medical services to day care to wellness centers the community schools model basically says let s make the school the hub of the community and house the services that kids need in the school building where we have them for eight hours a day instead of making them travel to glens falls for a dentist appointment because that is the only place that they ll be able to have their medicaid accepted carlisto said we are trying to bring the services that they need into the school because ultimately if you are able to provide the resources and have a student be made whole it leads to better educational outcomes the concept originated in mcdowell county west virginia ranked as one of the poorest counties in the nation in 2011 the local teachers union spearheaded the launch of reconnecting mcdowell an effort to improve educational outcomes by addressing poverty and its impact on students and families the effort has evolved into a partnership among fortune 500 corporations and labor unions national state and local nonprofits and agencies parents and pastors school personnel and students and local residents according to a press release from the american federation of teachers together the groups have created community schools that have seen graduation rates increase from 74 percent in 2010 11 to 88 percent in 2015 16 and drop out rates decrease from 4 5 percent to 1 6 percent during that same period according to the union test scores increased overall and the number of students attending college jumped from 24 6 percent to 40 3 percent carlisto gets excited when he talks about the role teachers unions can play in improving education and economies in rural areas in massena the possible closure of an alcoa plant the area s biggest employer in 2015 led to the creation of the people project an initiative of the massena federation of teachers the people project focuses on economic development health and wellness and community schools its latest effort is the creation of a regional chamber of commerce teachers unions are engaging with communities in ways that maybe we haven t before to defend the communities when their economic vitality is threatened carlisto said i think ultimately that s one of the strategies going forward to kind of start to mitigate and hopefully reverse this trend in declining involvement enrollment making sure that communities are viable and sustainable and brimming with opportunity for folks
when the commerce department reported 3 2 percent annualized u s gdp growth for the first quarter in late april it caught pundits academics and economists by surprise january s record government shutdown the fourth quarter plunge in stock prices and widely reported recession fears had dragged down consensus estimates which hovered closer to 2 2 percent mosads the report seemed to confirm the strong stock market gains of the first quarter particularly when considered against the recession fears that dominated the final months of 2018 however hiding behind that strong gdp number was the second weakest quarter for consumer spending in three and a half years a performance made worse when considering the dreadful 1 6 percent decline in december retail sales fluctuations in trade and government spending combined with a build up in business inventories accounted for 2 0 percentage points of the 3 2 percent gain given the importance of consumers to the american economy should the first quarter weakness be perceived as a sign of more troubling economic conditions ahead no not in our opinion if consumers were in poor financial shape as they usually are this deep into an economic expansion we would be much more concerned with the first quarter results however we re dealing with a new american consumer gone are the materialistic days of the 1980s the internet mania and dow 36 000 ideas of the late 1990s or even the riches through real estate philosophies of the housing bubble importantly while consumer spending slowed in the first quarter consumer income growth remained solid as a result the savings rate over the first three months of the year was a healthy 7 0 percent put differently consumers were not out of spending fuel they were simply keeping it in reserve the new american consumer slow and steady since the great recession ended in mid 2009 consumers have been more conservative in their spending behavior and finances than they have been in decades nowhere is this more evident than in looking at consumer debt relative to income historically as the economy expands so does consumer leverage debt relative to income eventually debt burdens become stretched forcing households to slow their spending businesses would react by shedding workers and pulling back on their own spending and the next recession would be born not this time around while consumer confidence has risen steadily throughout the current expansion consumer debt relative to income has not the federal reserve s financial obligations ratio for looks at required consumer monthly payments in relation to disposable income through the fourth quarter of 2018 although the ratio is off its post recession lows it remains at levels not seen since the early 1980s a time when excessively high interest rates made borrowing money akin to sticking one s hand into an open flame additionally consumer loan delinquency rates though off their record lows of a few short years ago remain well below their all time lows as seen prior to the great recession it s even become fashionable to have a high credit score as the consumer goes so goes the economy consumers account for 70 percent of u s economic activity and no sector comes close to its influence over the direction of economic activity quarterly results fluctuate but over time as the consumer goes so goes the u s economy of course consumers can be fickle or cautious as we prefer to describe their first quarter spending behavior yet sound finances provide a solid base to the economic outlook in our view we do not expect spending to surge by any means at least not on a sustained basis but neither do we see reason for consumers to materially constrain their spending any time soon slow and steady wins the race since the great recession ended in mid 2009 the u s economy has registered an average annual real growth rate of 2 3 percent which is slower than historical averages but very close to what we believe is the u s economy s current sustainable pace of between 2 0 percent and 2 5 percent as the term implies this is the rate the u s economy can theoretically sustain given its underlying demographics and assumptions about productivity the congressional budget office uses the term potential rate of growth for example over the last 10 years growth has been slower than historical averages yet strong enough to achieve a steady decline in unemployment and generally balanced inflation all the while not needing to rely on a buildup in leverage i e debt the economy s sustainable rate may ease a bit more in the years and decades ahead but longer expansions contained inflation pressures and lower interest rates than historical averages is a favorable trade off in our view the late cycle misnomer the u s economy is in its 10th year of expansion well beyond the historical average of seven to eight years as a result the term late cycle has become quite fashionable in the investment world but investors should take such terminology with a grain of salt mossecondads economic downturns do not come and go based on the calendar they come and go when imbalances build up in the economy usually in the form of too much consumer debt additionally the good news on consumers does not end with sound balance sheets as is well known the job market is stronger than it has been in decades home values are well supported by fundamentals wage growth is gaining traction albeit at a reasonable pace and true inflation problems are little more than a textbook topic to anyone born after 1980 as with nearly everything in life no one can predict the future economic or otherwise with guaranteed accuracy however in our view there is no better way to increase your odds of a positive economic outcome than to step into that future with sound consumer finances russell price is the chief economist for ameriprise financial

politicians journalists and ngos tend to believe that education can be the solution that stops armed fighting kofi annan the former secretary general of the un for example stressed that ducation is quite simply peace building by another name it is the most effective form of defence spending there is and nelson mandela put forward that o one is born hating another person because of the colour of his skin or his background or his religion people must learn to hate and if they can learn to hate they can be taught to love or in the words of the philippine s chief negotiator miriam coronel ferrer ducation is the lasting solution to mindanao war but what do the data say it turns out that there is also statistical evidence in economics that documents a series of suggestive empirical regularities between economic perspectives and political violence in particular some of the strongest predictors of conflicts are poverty and dismal economic opportunities miguel et al 2004 and human capital accumulation could be a prominent way of improving economic chances in turns perspectives of well paid jobs may result in a larger opportunity cost of leaving paid work for participating in armed violence other subtle arguments linking education to political stability are that wealth embodied in human capital can be less easily appropriated than physical capital and that education may transmit values of tolerance de la brière et al 2017 at the same time of course one could think of scenarios where high education in the presence of poorly working labour markets could lead to an explosive blend of discontent fuelling tensions directly studying the nexus between education and political violence is notoriously difficult as both variables are endogenous and causality could go both ways and be influenced by a series of confounders for example cross country correlations of education being positively associated with peace could be spurious and entirely driven by for example good governance or high gdp in a recent paper we aim to carry out an empirical investigation of the effects of education on the risk of conflict drawing on a quasi natural experiment with the help of which we strive to address a series of statistical biases pertaining to the study of the impact of education rohner and saia 2019 in particular we assess the impact of the inpres school construction programme in indonesia which took place between 1974 and 1978 and is one of the largest and fastest school construction programmes ever implemented under its aegis 61 000 new primary schools were constructed which represents more than a doubling of the stock of available schools this programme has been extensively studied by economists most prominently by duflo 2001 finding for example that it improved education levels and labour market outcomes to the best of our knowledge our paper is the first to link this school construction programme to armed conflict rohner and saia 2019 in order to be able to carry out this analysis we first had to create using newspaper data and applying techniques of web crawling web scraping and text recognition a novel dataset on conflict in indonesia at a fine grained district level over a 40 year period our main identification strategy relies on a difference in differences approach where we exploit the impact of sharp changes in education provision leading to sharp changes in fighting outcomes the baseline specification controls for district fixed effects filtering out time invariant factors province year fixed effects filtering out shocks to the 26 provinces and district specific time trends accounting for long run evolution and catching up we also control for potential drivers of school construction and carries out a vast array of sensitivity checks controlling for other government programs migration weather and natural resource shocks among others we investigate robustness using alternative conflict data and other econometric specifications and restricting the analysis to a series of subsamples we find that inpres school construction has indeed led to a statistically significant decrease in conflict this impact of inpres school construction is found to become bigger over time as one would expect i e in the years after the programme the number of cohorts leaving the new inpres schools has mechanically increased and with greater age treated cohorts have approached the critical period of the life cycle when child soldiering peaks and where education typically can make the largest difference the effect of inpres is quantitatively sizable with a one standard deviation increase in schools built resulting at the end of the sample period in a drop of three quarters from the baseline conflict risk in a following step we study the potential mechanisms at work it turns out that both the religious composition of the local population as well as the local economy affect the size of the impact of school construction as expected we find stronger effects in places where the economic returns to education are high where opportunity cost effects are plausible and in areas that are religiously polarised where open mindedness and tolerance may be particularly critical using individual level data we also document that exposure to inpres school construction increases inter religious trust and community involvement this is in line with the result that while increased schooling reduces the potential for violent rebellion it does not curb the scope for peaceful protests thus schooling can lead to a shift from violence to voice concluding remarks to sum up our results suggest that while the lack of education may not be a unique determinant of political violence an increase in schooling could well be a key public policy for reducing armed civil conflict intensity these findings are based on a large scale primary school construction programme in indonesia and a natural question that remains is to what

from birch gold group on tuesday potus took to twitter and called for the fed to cut rates by 1 pointing to 3 2 gdp growth and wonderfully low inflation china is adding great stimulus to its economy while at the same time keeping interest rates low our federal reserve has incessantly lifted interest rates even though inflation is very low and instituted a very big dose of quantitative tightening we have the potential to go donald j trump realdonaldtrump april 30 2019 up like a rocket if we did some lowering of rates like one point and some quantitative easing yes we are doing very well at 3 2 gdp but with our wonderfully low inflation we could be setting major records at the same time make our national debt start to look small donald j trump realdonaldtrump april 30 2019 however it s hard to say if inflation is as wonderfully low as potus claims after all official sources saw cpi inflation jump to 1 9 with rapidly rising food prices reported as the leading cause plus the growing economy potus alludes to appears to have topped out since january 2018 see red arrow in the chart below source additionally according to an official source a 3 2 or higher gdp growth rate has happened on 3 different occasions before potus took office the same source also reports that gdp growth rate in the united states averaged 3 22 percent from 1947 until 2019 so really current gdp growth only appears to be on par with the average white house officials including potus and top economic advisor larry kudlow have recommended the fed cut rates by half a point in the past despite all the information above cnbc reports that with his 1 cut recommendation potus has doubled down on this approach something important to note according to cnn a cut of 100 basis points in a developed world doesn t just happen that s just the point central banks in the developed world don t tend to slash interest rates by a magnitude like 100 basis points just to stimulate some additional growth it takes a crisis to perform an emergency cut of that magnitude in addition to all this potus also made a second request for more quantitative easing qe according to cnbc the fed already printed money three times during and after the financial crisis to prop up the u s economy and right now it doesn t appear like the fed will be going down that road again considering they re right in the middle of a huge balance sheet runoff on autopilot until september however that doesn t eliminate the possibility of more tinkering with the u s economy the fed holds rates steady and considering qe reinvented in their most recent fomc meeting the fed voted to hold rates steady between 2 25 2 5 chairman powell s remarks on rates were summarized at cnbc powell said wednesday that recently low inflation pressures may just be transitory hinting that a rate cut may not be on the horizon which disappoint traders powell s comments sparked a sharp sell off in the previous session with the dow closing more than 150 points lower the same cnbc piece highlighted a less than 50 chance of lowering rates in fact there is still at least one more potential rate hike left toward the end of 2019 according to s p global ratings but that s not all in an effort to find more ways to runoff their balance sheet without disrupting the market another cnbc piece revealed the fed is also discussing a new program that appears much like a reinvented form of qe federal reserve officials are considering a new program that would allow banks to exchange treasurys for reserves a move aimed at ensuring liquidity during difficult times that also would help the central bank decrease the size of its nearly 4 trillion balance sheet critics of this new idea think it in essence could be a repackaged form of quantitative easing and thus yet another iteration of the fed s decadelong tinkering in financial markets according to the same cnbc piece add a sputtering dow to a 200 point drop as of 05 02 at 1pm edt tied to both potus and the fed s announcements and it s hard to tell if the entire 10 year economic boom may be turning into a bust while the fed tinkers strengthen your portfolio between the fed tinkering

start your research here if you re thinking of moving to ireland from the us is moving to ireland your dream we all have the ideal image but in reality this is much easier said than done moving to any other country for good is going to be a big task yes for the average american moving to ireland may be hard but we ve put together this handy guide to get you through or at least help you in the attempt getting a visa to move to ireland as an american citizen this is possibly the most difficult and uncertain part of the whole moving to ireland process but checking with your nearest irish embassy is a good place to start the irish naturalisation and immigration service inis was established in 2005 in order to provide a one stop shop in relation to asylum immigration citizenship and visas you can explore the options personally available to you here or check out some faq here us citizens can travel to ireland without a visa for three months but any plan to stay longer than that and they have three main options go to ireland to work study or retire the d visa is a single entry long term visa allowing you to travel to ireland to pursue a course of study to work or settle permanently in ireland with family members who are already residents more information can be found here studying one option is to enroll in a course of study but if you plan on staying in ireland long term unfortunately years spent in the country as a student are not counted as years of residence when applying for citizenship working to be completely honest if looking for a work visa it is difficult and there are many reasons why you may not be able to acquire a permit you ll need to have a job lined up before applying for the visa and convincing a company to hire you instead of an eu citizen may be hard if you do manage to find a job the chances of you getting a work visa are higher if you earn more if you earn less than 30 000 for example it becomes much more difficult you can check out the two largest irish job sites to see what s available at irishjobs ie or try browsing linkedin retiring the third option is retirement and this also demands a lot of cash although one third of irish americans would like to retire in ireland new rules implemented in 2015 make it increasingly difficult the new rule requires that retirees have an annual income of no less than 55 138 50 000 per person 110 276 100 000 for a married couple for the remainder of their lives in ireland regardless of their existing cash on hand or lack of debt if you chose to move to a county within northern ireland this process will be different as you will need to apply for a visa to the uk and submit your application to the uk home office you can start your application for settling in the uk northern ireland indefinitely here there is also a range of work or study visas available on the uk s home office website read more how can you retire to ireland from america how to acquire irish citizenship if you re lucky enough to have a parent or a grandparent who was born in ireland you will not even need to worry about a visa but can instead apply for irish citizenship hurray we have a guide on how you can do this and all the rules that apply here taxes in ireland according to current tax agreements between ireland and the us a us citizen living and working in ireland will pay taxes to ireland on money earned while in ireland and vice versa while the more right leaning among us may already feel they re paying way too much money to the government and the state in the u s irish taxes apart from the tempting 12 5 corporation tax to entice business of course are pretty high in general less is asked of those on a low income but the increase in taxes will really be felt on middle class incomes for example according to 2017 figures tax paid on a salary of 18 000 will amount to 510 below the u s which would pay 2 387 once we get up to a salary of 75 000 however ireland would pay 26 129 while the u s would pay only 18 761 it would be important to take this into account depending on your predicted salary interestingly enough the u s still pays more taxes as a percentage of the country s g d p than ireland does again the corporation tax could have something to do with this in 2015 us taxes at all levels of government represented 26 percent of gdp compared with an average of 34 percent of gdp for the 34 member countries of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd among oecd countries only korea chile mexico and ireland collected less than the united states as a percentage of gdp where are you going to live in ireland i weirdly heard a person boasting recently that the rent in dublin is now as high if not exceeding london this is very far from a good thing as while dublin is a fantastic city with many great companies making their base there we should not quite be at london standards yet house prices not just in dublin but across the country and moving steadily upwards again although certain quieter counties and towns will of course still offer cheaper accommodation while it s a good idea to have visited the village town or city you wish to move to at least once before you move to get a feel for the neighborhood and attempt to line up accommodation temporary accommodation is an option a downside would be of course how difficult this could be to coordinate if you plan on bringing most of your us possessions with you do you want to move twice within a short space of time to save yourself money on expensive hostels hotels and short term leases and to avoid the sense of floundering on arrival we d advise that you know where you ll be living before you make the move it doesn t always happen but with websites such as daft ie and the real estate alliance offering advice on buying a property in ireland you can at least research well before taking the plunge are you an american who has moved to ireland let us know your story at editors irishcentral com originally published in march 2018 updated in june 2022

the ripley central school district tucked away in a quiet corner of western new york state near the banks of lake erie served more than 500 students in 1994 today only 137 students are enrolled in the district a loss of about 73 percent some of that loss was intentional ripley pays to send its 100 high schoolers elsewhere so they will have more and better opportunities it is a solution that is attracting attention in a state where enrollment in rural districts has declined steadily over the past 25 years they are still our kids so we are still invested in their successes said paul mccutcheon president of the ripley school board it works like a regional high school probably would rural migration is a disturbing trend for those concerned about equality in education in new york state declining enrollments have certainly affected school districts in the cayuga county area which is largely rural data from the state department of education for 1994 through 2017 show an average 30 2 enrollment drop for the nine districts that are components of the cayuga onondaga boces region the smallest decline at 19 74 belonged to the least rural district auburn enlarged city school district southern cayuga central district by contrast experienced a 48 61 decrease the largest among the nine local districts the lower student populations have driven decisions to close several school buildings locally over the years including auburn s west middle school in 2011 southern cayuga s emily howland elementary school in 2012 and union spring central school district s cayuga elementary school in 2018 new york stands out economics and natural change are to blame for the decrease in rural populations nationwide according to an analysis by the u s department of agriculture but in new york s school districts where two thirds of nonfederal funding comes from local property taxes the impact is particularly intense even the brightest students in rural schools find it hard to compete for employment and college admissions with students from more populated areas where advanced classes and electives are plentiful experts say the kind of educational programming and the breath of curriculum you get is far too dependent on what the community itself can afford said david little executive director of the rural schools association of new york state that s exactly the opposite of the way it is in virtually every other state in the union most states pay two thirds the cost of education and the one third that locality pays for is really kind of curriculum enhancement when economies decline so do property tax revenues fewer students and less local money means fewer opportunities while their peers in urban and suburban school districts can choose from full menus of advanced placement honors and college courses many rural school districts can offer only a select few foreign language courses are often limited to one or two choices classes like dance theater and photography are nearly unheard of those limited options can make students less appealing to colleges and universities little said his own son was rejected by his dream college because his high school did not offer the electives they were looking for it is kind of this downward spiral that we are only now economically starting to get out of little said and until the state recognizes that these communities have a burden that s far too dramatic for them to overcome on their own and the state agrees to alter the way that it funds public education we won t stop the spiral the state education department declined interview requests for this story instead issuing a statement that says it is committed to ensuring all students thrive and succeed the state received 1 6 billion in federal funds under the every student succeeds act to work on such strategies beginning in the spring of 2018 according to the statement of that money 80 million is earmarked for improvements and programs in the state s lowest performing districts which includes rural schools above all our essa plan emphasizes the importance of fostering equity in education for all of new york s students and one of the most important ways we do this by incentivizing districts to provide opportunities to all high school students to engage in advanced coursework that is often unavailable in smaller rural school districts according to the statement little said the state s plans for the federal grant money give him hope but he noted that new york city as a high needs district will likely get half of the 80 million designated for program improvements leaving only 40 million for the 320 rural districts that need it even if the money is well used the impact will not be great enough he said it s not a panacea little said it s an indication that they recognize the need and are willing to begin to target resources for it so we are happy about that but i hope that they don t think it fixes the problem seeking creative solutions like little many experts agree that the long term solution is to change the way public schools are funded in new york state in the meantime however rural communities are getting creative they are experimenting with regional high schools community school districts and distance learning programs that offer students more options they are working with local colleges and businesses to provide more jobs and train students for existing jobs they are evolving in order to survive and ripley has taken the lead we had reached a point where we couldn t sustain what we needed to for a high school in terms of giving students educational options mccutcheon said we had the bare necessities but it was really difficult to have any kind of electives programs because we didn t have enough student body and enough tax base really to have a successful high school program in 2013 ripley eliminated its high school classes and began paying tuition for its students to attend nearby chautauqua lake central high school its students now have access to college courses electives such as mandarin chinese and television production and a variety of stem classes the two districts share administrative services as well such as a transportation supervisor and a building manager despite the enrollment loss ripley s halls are far from empty to fill the void ripley leases office space to the town at cost the district has also opened up its building to the community housing a local food pantry and maintaining a fitness center that is free to residents we are always keeping our ear to the ground to see what is out there for opportunities mccutcheon said the usda s department of economic research studies population migration their research reveals two major forces behind population decline in rural areas the economy is one factor jobs are harder to find in rural areas making urban and suburban areas more attractive especially to recent college graduates the second reason is natural change elderly residents are dying at typical rates but young people are having fewer babies recent statistics show slight increases in natural change in the past two years offering some hope that losses overall will at least slow down little said new york s rural districts have been particularly hard hit in the past seven years he believes the state s high taxes are not only driving people out of rural areas but out of the state as a whole worsening the problem if i come out of college and i am in a rural area i not only have very few economic opportunities within a rural area to come back home to but i also have to be willing in addition to my student loans to accept higher taxes and the higher debt load that will ensure that my taxes are higher going into the future he said little s organization is lobbying for an overhaul in the state funding system but that will not help today s students so districts are exploring and implementing short term solutions attempts at consolidation mergers once a popular answer to the problem have mostly failed in recent years bob lowry deputy director of the state s council of school superintendents says higher taxes for the smaller districts in proposed mergers and loss of identity for both districts are factors while mergers are failing proposals for regional high schools community schools and distance learning program are gaining popularity the concept of regional high schools has been tossed around for years but the state has done little to promote it lowry said under a regional high school system participating districts would retain their elementary and middle schools but would pick one building to serve all the area s high school students such systems are popular in other states and have been successful in parts of long island little said it really has the opportunity to transform rural new york the ideal of regional high schools is very much the forefront of what i think needs to be done for our rural schools he said regional high schools would be supported by all involved districts the concept is similar to that of the state s board of cooperative educational services which provides shared educational services and programs to school districts mostly in special education and career and technical education each region has its own boces and each participating district has a representative on the boces school board districts decide each year what services they need and then pay for those services out of their annual budgets ripley s solution differs from the regional high school concept in that district residents have no representation on the chautauqua lake school board the district pays nearly 8 000 per student each year it pays less for students who attend boces half time and nothing for those who attend boces full time ripley has no official say in class offerings policy decisions or any other issues related to chautauqua lake high school it is not practical or economically wise for every district to tuition out all its students but the state s teachers union has traditionally opposed the creation of regional high schools lowry said teachers fear that merged high schools will lead to job losses he said we ve already had the loss of jobs lowry said now we are trying to save jobs and expand the curriculum we need every teacher we can get matthew hamilton spokesperson for new york state united teachers declined to comment specifically on the union s position on regional schools don carlisto dean of students for saranac lake s middle school sits on the nysut board of directors and is president of the saranac lake chapter he said mergers and regional schools can succeed when all parties work together to do what is best for kids teachers and residents carlisto pointed to a recent merger of the elizabethtown lewis and westport central districts as an example i think that we would be doing a disservice if we just sort of had this reflexive kind of knee jerk reaction that the teachers union are obstructionists carlisto said there are always going to be obstructionists there are plenty of examples that i can cite where teachers unions are at the table with communities sort of moving issues forward saranac lake s enrollment has dropped almost 35 percent since 1994 forcing the closing of all but one neighborhood elementary school the district is already the state s largest at more than 600 square miles some students sit on buses for more than an hour each way merging with another district would be impractical saranac lake has instead adopted the community schools concept with the support of the teachers union the superintendent and the school board carlisto said community schools attempt to stave off migration by making rural life more appealing and more feasible schools become community centers offering everything from medical services to day care to wellness centers the community schools model basically says let s make the school the hub of the community and house the services that kids need in the school building where we have them for eight hours a day instead of making them travel to glens falls for a dentist appointment because that is the only place that they ll be able to have their medicaid accepted carlisto said we are trying to bring the services that they need into the school because ultimately if you are able to provide the resources and have a student be made whole it leads to better educational outcomes the concept originated in mcdowell county west virginia ranked as one of the poorest counties in the nation in 2011 the local teachers union spearheaded the launch of reconnecting mcdowell an effort to improve educational outcomes by addressing poverty and its impact on students and families the effort has evolved into a partnership among fortune 500 corporations and labor unions national state and local nonprofits and agencies parents and pastors school personnel and students and local residents according to a press release from the american federation of teachers together the groups have created community schools that have seen graduation rates increase from 74 percent in 2010 11 to 88 percent in 2015 16 and drop out rates decrease from 4 5 percent to 1 6 percent during that same period according to the union test scores increased overall and the number of students attending college jumped from 24 6 percent to 40 3 percent this spring reconnect mcdowell will break ground on an apartment complex with amenities designed to attract new teachers and other young professionals to the area carlisto gets excited when he talks about the role teachers unions can play in improving education and economies in rural areas in massena the possible closure of an alcoa plant the area s biggest employer in 2015 led to the creation of the people project an initiative of the massena federation of teachers the people project focuses on economic development health and wellness and community schools it s latest effort is the creation of a regional chamber of commerce teachers unions are engaging with communities in ways that maybe we haven t before to defend the communities when their economic vitality is threatened carlisto said i think ultimately that s one of the strategies going forward to kind of start to mitigate and hopefully reverse this trend in declining involvement enrollment making sure that communities are viable and sustainable and brimming with opportunity for folks though some state funding is available for community school initiatives saranac lake gets none the school board carved money out of the budget to hire a coordinator in july and formed an advisory council made up of parents who are traditionally unable to become involved in school issues already the district is seeing results the parents group noted that a bus driver shortage could be rectified by offering training and licensing locally so unemployed residents can apply for the jobs the district is working to provide free eye care and to coordinate services with the united way it is just a matter of getting all of the moving parts moving in the same direction under the umbrella of the school district that is not something that has happened before and it is now starting to happen with the community schools model carlisto said like many other rural school districts saranac lake is also integrating distance learning as a way to expand its offerings for students the teachers union has been careful to ensure that computers do not replace teachers the district offers online classes only if students demand them and no current staff is qualified to teach them a teacher or a teacher s aide is always in the room to help students when they need it little said distance learning is much more appealing than it was in the past it is more interactive thanks to advances in technology that offer video conferencing 3d printing simulators and individualized learning he compares the impact of the digital technology on schools to that of the school bus when it was first introduced though school buses have been transporting children since the days of the horse and carriage they did not become widely popular until the 1940s after new manufacturing standards were developed to make them safer before the school bus we didn t teach kids in an age appropriate fashion and we didn t even really teach them sequentially for education they were in much smaller if not one room schools little said the school bus allowed us to put enough kids of a certain age at one time in one place to be able to teach them all like that well the computer has changed time and place again still little said efforts to create regional schools community schools and distance learning programs are not enough the state s funding formula is unconstitutional in that it results in less competitive diplomas in districts with low property taxes he said though education is not a fundamental right the 14th amendment requires equal access to schooling in states that provide it as important as all of those other things are and as impactful as all of those things could be actually getting an accurate and equitable state funding formula trumps them all little said it is a really simple concept
for his part chairman powell believes the fed s cautious and data dependent approach is the best road to take at this point the us economy remains one of the best performing in the world while its key trading partners china and the uk are also doing better than forecasts had suggested for the past two years however recessionary pressures in the eu currency crises in turkey and argentina along with the slowing global demand for consumer goods and commodities pose a longer term concern for us policymakers additionally while trump and his white house officials believe they would be able to strike a series of bilateral trade deals across the globe the risk of disruptions in trade with eu china and the nations of southeast asia remains quite high read more trump says cain withdraws nomination for federal reserve board meanwhile us economic growth for the first quarter of this year came in at 3 2 percent far above earlier expectations as experts believed the partial government shutdown at the beginning of the year and harsh winter conditions could have weighed on the pace of gdp expansion that didn t happen and forward looking projections suggest the us economy could accelerate to above 4 percent annual expansion in the second half of the year but some policymakers are cautious saying some underlying weakness remains while the economy is in its late cycle expansion phase meaning it would now take less to trigger an economic downturn i think it s still my view that we are running out of the capacity in the workforce dallas fed president robert kaplan said i would expect it s going to slow down but i don t think it s going to be a bad sign fed officials have reaffirmed they will watch the developments in ongoing trade talks with china as well as monitor the global economic landscape to identify and tackle risks at an early stage overall the course of monetary policy is expected to remain stable in the upcoming months
a controversial russian economist is standing by his wild theory that united states sanctions against russia will push the bitcoin price to us 2 million by the beginning of next year vladislav ginko who hit hit the headlines earlier this year with his bold predictions says the kremlin wants bitcoin to replace the us dollar as a reserve currency in a bid to mitigate the sanctions russia has already started buying bitcoin a lot mr ginko said my meter shows that it s reached 9 3 billion in usd equivalents ginko s inside knowledge mr ginko says he learned about russia s desire to invest in bitcoin while teaching corporate finance classes in moscow i speak with professional investors working for the state and in big private companies mr ginko told micky we discuss such things i ve got info from them and after i juxtapose it with other sources of info i come to some figures how united states sanctions will spark the rally mr ginko believes united state sanctions against russia will cause the enormous bull run that will send the bitcoin price towards us 2 million i believe that trump will be forced to introduce severe sanctions against russia s economy and this will bring about colossal demand for bitcoin inside russia mr ginko said i consider that trump being fearful of impeachment will kick off such measures then it ll lead immediately to a skyrocketing demand for bitcoins mr ginko who claims he doesn t own bitcoin due to the position he holds in moscow says the reason big money hasn t fully flowed into the digital currency is that most investors lack confidence in using the new technology the main obstacle is that people who sit on hundreds of millions of dollars have no clue how to buy bitcoin and are afraid that they ll lose their money if something went wrong is vladislav ginko legit when micky first interviewed vladislav ginko there were questions about his credibility however we have spoken to the economist via skype and can confirm his twitter account where he makes all kinds of extraordinary claims is not a fake in the skype call which was recorded without any payment to ginko the analyst appears to speak to micky on his way into a tv studio in a statement to micky ginko said he is a famous public figure in russia and that he doesn t answer to the trolls who doubt him on the internet similar predictions john mcafee the high profile founder of mcafee antivirus is also confident that bitcoin s price will skyrocket over the next 12 24 months anyone who can add and subtract and who has even the slightest comprehension of point set topology knows absolutely that it can t be less than one mil within two years mr mcafee tweeted does no one study math anymore wtf people bitcoin over 400 000 in two years anyone who can add and subtract and who has even the slightest comprehension of point set topology knows absolutely that it can t be less than one mil within two years does no one study math anymore wtf people john mcafee officialmcafee may 3 2019 mcafee said the resistance to his bitcoin price predictions stems from the fact that most people apply the paradigm of the traditional stock market formulas to the crypto market only an idiot could miss the fact that the crypto market is a brand new paradigm unto itself he said are we all that stupid

network of aging gas mains it is absolutely clear that the current pgw business model is not sustainable in the world mark alan hughes director of the university of pennsylvania s kleinman center for energy policy told a city council committee that is exploring the city utility s future in a world that s getting warmer the cloud over the 183 year old utility casts a shadow on nearly 1 600 workers and 1 4 billion invested in pipes and plant a potential taxpayer liability if they become stranded assets a green future could mean higher costs for its 500 000 residential and commercial customers especially for 146 000 low income customers who currently struggle to pay their bills advertisement the city is undertaking a study to explore a just transition for pgw the nation s largest municipal utility said christine knapp the city s director of sustainability the study whose budget is undetermined will be financed under an award from the bloomberg american cities climate challenge and is expected to be completed by the end of 2020 she said we already know that this utility is having basic business problems and will continue to do so especially when you think about a future where there s a carbon tax or other policies that would restrain fossil fuels she said carbon footprint pgw could continue to operate as a natural gas utility there is no shortage of low priced hydraulically fracked natural gas in pennsylvania which has become the nation s second largest gas producer in the last decade the gas boom has pushed down prices for energy including electricity but climate activists say fossil fuels are unacceptable and incompatible with the city s formal pledge to uphold the goals of the paris climate accords which call for an 80 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2050 a parade of witnesses who testified april 26 before council s committee on transportation and public utilities outlined options for pgw to reduce carbon emissions including a switchover from fossil fuels to renewable gas which would utilize the utility s existing infrastructure as well as customers existing heating systems renewable gas produced from landfill waste and livestock manure is expensive and in short supply and potential new sources of carbon neutral synthetic gas are not being produced in commercial quantities rather a more dramatic alternative that has gained traction among activists is to run everything on electricity because the electrical power grid will get cleaner over time as fossil fuel power plants are retired costly options skeptics question whether the cost of switching residential gas users to electricity will appreciably reduce greenhouse gas emissions an american gas association report last year found that even if 60 percent of the nation s residential customers switched to electricity by 2035 it would reduce carbon emissions by only 1 5 percent switching pgw s 500 000 customers would involve a massive and expensive swap of heating systems and a neighborhood by neighborhood decommissioning of the gas distribution system to avoid spending millions of dollars repairing old pipes pgw estimates that it would cost 12 billion just to replace the city s residential gas heating systems about 25 000 per household that doesn t count higher annual operating costs for electrical heating systems a switch to electricity would also require a huge expansion of the electric generation and distribution system to serve the new demand for electrical load particularly during the winter those costs would be spread among all electricity customers not just those who switched from gas fuel delivered by pgw is responsible for 22 percent of the city s carbon footprint according to the rocky mountain institute about 15 percent of pgw s volume is consumed by a single customer veolia energy s power plant on christian street which provides steam heat to about 500 buildings in and around center city including hospitals universities skyscrapers city hall and the art museum one repercussion of electrification is that the folks in the city who would be able to electrify their homes would do so and everybody else would be left with the bill for pgw s infrastructure said knapp nearly 31 percent of pgw s residential customers are low income households many of whom qualify for rates subsidized by other customers pgw already has the highest rates in the state a typical pgw residential customer pays 40 percent more than a customer of pennsylvania s nine other gas utilities according to robert w ballenger a community legal services lawyer who acts as ratepayer advocate but if pgw loses customers those who remain on the system will still have to pay the utility s fixed costs as long as pgw has customers state regulators require it to maintain and repair its system to keep it safe the utility says it supports the city s ambitious emissions reduction goals and is excited about the forthcoming study to understand future energy services that will help the utility continue to thrive in a low carbon future but the electrification scenario also poses a fundamental challenge for pgw whose business plan in recent years has focused on developing new customers and uses for natural gas to make up for the loss of sales due to population declines more efficiency and reduced demand because of warming winters some suggest that pgw could simply become an electricity provider peco energy owned by exelon corp has a state protected monopoly to provide electric distribution service in the city and would not relinquish its franchise easily without seeking compensation other experts suggest that a diminished pgw and its 1 600 employees could be refocused on providing services financing installing and maintaining new heating systems or operating community solar systems or district heating systems in this scenario the utility provides services such as comfort and heat rather than commodities like cubic feet of gas or kilowatt hours of electricity said mark silberg an associate with the rocky mountain institute a nonprofit think tank that is working with the city through the bloomberg climate challenge the institute has also been a strong advocate for electrification political pressure the issue of pgw s possible diversification is coming into focus just as council is set to consider the city s plans to partner with a developer to build a liquefied natural gas lng facility at pgw s passyunk plant under the agreement liberty energy trust would pay the costs to build the 60 million plant pgw would get at least 1 35 million a year to operate it reducing the need for rate increases lng is a liquid form of natural gas that is in demand primarily for power generation often to replace dirtier fuel oil or diesel though the lng plan involves no city investment other than the use of pgw s land and an existing lng storage tank at passyunk it has drawn sharp criticism from climate activists who have made its passage a political issue green activists are opposed to any expanded fossil fuel use pennenvironment and other environmental groups in february promised to oppose any council incumbents who voted for the lng plant council delayed a vote on the lng project until after the may 21 primary the climate activists say that pgw s status as the nation s largest municipal utility puts philadelphia in a unique position to lead the way to a response on climate change but councilman derek green who chairs the philadelphia gas commission panel that in december recommended approval of the lng plan urged caution about rushing into the wrong decision on a climate response green likened the choice the city now faces to the decision confronting television viewers during the videotape format war of the 1970s i m looking at these different technologies that us being the city of philadelphia being a public entity we have a limited amount of resources we have to decide pick vhs or pick beta but don t pick the wrong one because we only have a small amount of dollars green said that private companies with more resources and a bigger appetite for risk were in a better position to find ultimately what works best
with more rain forecast for this week over much of the wool producing areas one can only hope that we are able to get a bit of pasture growth happening before soil temperatures decline too much the bureau of meteorology is still pointing to a 70 per cent chance of another el nino event however thankfully it is also saying it will be short lived if it does occur that may well lead to a dryish spring and possibly a wet summer which will not be ideal for the rebuilding of the australian wool flock but at current returns growers are very likely to persist with even the old girls
scc insight seattle a worst case scenario for rent control to be introduced with reporting by scci insight council member kshama sawant has decided that 2019 is the year to push for rent control in seattle even though there is still a statewide ban on it she held a rally in april announcing that she would be introducing rent control legislation to become effective if and when the state lifts its ban and she invited the seattle renters commission to present in her committee video here on why they are recommending that the city implement rent control i m not an economist not a landlord nor a renter but since we re having this debate i went to the uw library and pulled the literature on rent control so i could understand the issues the studies and what the experts conclude here is what i found rent control is not a new idea particularly in europe it was introduced in some cities in the united states during world war ii as a means to prevent wartime abuses while the economy was see sawing around that first generation of rent control would freeze rents at a specific level since then there is near universal agreement that first generation rent control is a terrible idea but it led to second generation rent control policies which allowed rents to rise a certain amount each year often tied to inflation rates not all rent control policies are created equal in fact there are a variety of knobs and dials to be tuned in choosing a particular form to implement the first most basic question is whether all rental housing will be subject to controls or only a subset many cities exempt newer housing constructed after a particular date others exempt adus and rented single family homes many invoke vacancy de control wherein a rental unit becomes exempt from rent control when a tenant leaves and the landlord can reset the rent back to market prices vacancy de control is popular with landlords but problematic in that it creates perverse incentives for landlords to evict tenants however it s debatable whether it actually causes tenants to pay higher rents over the course of a tenancy in california rent control advocates are actively campaigning for the repeal of the costa hawkins act which banned vacancy control and exempts certain types of housing from rent controls oregon s new rent control law also includes vacancy de control the benefits there are two benefits of rent control that have support in the research the first is the obvious one it does in fact reduce economic displacement by allowing people to stay in their homes longer the second is that it reduces the volatility of rental prices in hot housing markets to be clear it smooths increases into a steady predictable pattern of increases instead of wildly fluctuating increases and potentially decreases when the market goes soft when all rental housing is subject to rent control studies have shown that new rental housing construction drops off some jurisdictions have learned this lesson and have created public housing or social housing programs as a government intervention to ensure that additional housing continues to be built some funded entirely by the government and some through subsidizing private development when only a portion of the housing stock is under rent control then the housing market becomes partitioned with very different dynamics between the two the rent controlled housing becomes a finite world unto itself with low tenant turnover because of the strong financial incentive for tenants to stay put the rest of the housing stock becomes a smaller pool of housing than before rent control was enacted serving the rest of the population plus all the newcomers to the area that increased competition for a smaller pool drives prices even higher in fact the economic models and the empirical studies both show that the savings that the tenants see in rent controlled housing are offset by the increased prices in the uncontrolled market people in non rent controlled housing are in effect subsidizing the rents of the people in rent controlled housing that might be a good thing if the people in rent controlled housing were the ones who can least afford market rate housing but rent control doesn t work that way initially the people in rent controlled housing are the ones who were in that housing already but over time it becomes the ones with the best connections the best ability to hunt for available units and in some cases a tolerance for working the grey market to get a unit an effect repeatedly seen in rent controlled markets is that landlords spend less on upkeep maintenance and upgrades that doesn t mean that they let the units violate building or health codes but they do let the quality of the housing degrade until it matches what they are allowed to charge for it in rent a corollary of this effect is that tenants end up doing and paying for more maintenance themselves a hidden cost of rent control that offsets some of the benefit of lower rents some studies have shown that rent control decreases tenant mobility in that if a tenant receives a better job offer she he will refuse to move and instead choose to commute further or decline the job offer altogether rather than give up a rent controlled unit the same effect means that families with kids may stay in a rent controlled unit that doesn t have enough space for their needs rather than move or an empty nester couple may remain in a unit that has much more space than they need that s bad for the tenants but it s also bad for the community in that it misallocates the housing stock the people who need particular kinds of housing often don t end up in units that match those needs put another way there is a risk of overconsumption of affordable housing by tenants in rent controlled units as mentioned earlier in many cities that have implemented rent control landlords impose rent increases every year at or near the maximum allowed rather than when their costs require it this is because they know that if they fall behind the long term inflation rate rent controls will prevent them from catching up and that s only one tricky part of tying rent control to inflation another is simply choosing what inflation metric to tie it to some cities tie it to broad based consumer inflation but in places like seattle construction and building maintenance costs have far outpaced inflation so a landlord s ongoing costs will go up faster than consumer inflation rates we also mentioned vacancy control earlier in which landlords aren t allowed to reset rental rates between tenants but studies have shown that vacancy control doesn t change the amount paid by a tenant in the long term it just shifts it from the beginning to the end of the tenancy the regulatory cluster to address many of these issues and to prevent landlords from gaming the system jurisdictions often pile additional housing regulations on top of rent control that regulatory cluster of rules may control when a landlord may evict a tenant when additional rent increases may be allowed if a landlord wants to do a major upgrade minimum maintenance standards rules for offering a rental unit and for evaluating and choosing a new tenant and other tweaks collectively they make it more difficult and more expensive to be a landlord they create investment uncertainty since landlords don t know what new regulations will be imposed in the future and they ultimately create another strong incentive for apartment owners to convert their units to condominiums and simply get out of the rental housing business the heart of the problem with rent control is that it doesn t address the underlying cause of high rents housing scarcity if anything it makes the scarcity problem worse by creating a fierce disincentive to building more rental housing in the few cities with rent control where it hasn t created havoc it s because the government intervened with a public housing program essentially taking the burden upon itself to increase the housing supply after ensuring that private developers won t take berlin for example the city used by sawant in her press conference last week she cited its introduction of rent control in 2015 and a news article showing that it had been successful she neglected to mention that the article was published later in 2015 only a few months after rent control took effect and before it could have any real effects research and press coverage in the ensuing years have painted a gloomier picture of berlin s foray into rent control with a recent article suggesting that in the end it hasn t had much of an effect at all largely because berlin s version of rent control is so complicated that it s ineffective but berlin also committed to building tens of thousands of new housing units when it introduced rent control the montreal model in the seattle renters commission presentation last month they cited montreal which they consider to be the gold standard for rent control in north america they claimed that montreal has been booming and has added 100 000 people in the last ten years all the while rent control first imposed in 1979 has kept rents very low and renters happy but a closer look at montreal reveals a different more complicated picture montreal is very different from every other major city in north america it is a beautiful city of 1 75 million people where french is the primary language for government business and the majority of residents but that language barrier creates a level of social and commercial isolation in north america that kept the city in the economic doldrums for decades and equally kept its resident population growth very low for long periods of time on top of that montreal benefitted from a huge amount of residential housing built in the late 19th century and early part of the 20th century and a long term consistent investment by the federal and provincial governments in building social housing montreal has 62 000 units of social housing by contrast all of king county has 8 000 until very recently montreal has been a city with a stable population low wages and low rents as the renters commission pointed out montreal added 100 000 to its population in the last decade but on a base of 1 65 million people seattle added 120 000 people over the same period but from a base of around 600 000 also much of montreal s growth has been since 2017 when it began a much celebrated economic revival as recently as 2014 local leaders were complaining that montreal had been in an economic slump for 15 years but the last couple of years the economy has picked up though it still lags other large canadian cities but when we look at the construction and housing numbers for montreal we see some very interesting things the value of permits for residential construction was in steady decline up to 2017 when it suddenly skyrocketed however when we look at the housing stock itself we see that the amount of rental housing available is continuing to decline and nearly all the growth is in condominiums with a small amount of growth in single family homes in fact condominiums have bucked the trend in montreal and grown steadily for years this is exactly what you would expect to see in a rent controlled city condo conversions and construction shifting from rental housing to owned homes the provincial and federal governments cut back on their funding for social housing programs in montreal several years ago and now that a new housing crisis is emerging montreal s mayor campaigned on a new push for public funding for affordable rental housing in the meantime montreal s rental housing has developed a reputation for being a collection of older though in many cases beautifully antique units that have not been maintained well again this is exactly what we would expect to see in a rent controlled city montreal is far from the rent control paradise that advocates suggest and it was saved from the worst liabilities of its rent control policy by a long term investment in housing but to the extent that montreal is now booming the problems with rent control are coming home to roost what are the lessons for seattle first we need to recognize that seattle is a worst case scenario for rent control to be introduced it already has a critical shortage of housing there is not nearly enough public and subsidized housing and the population and economy continue to grow to the extent that the housing stock is starting to catch up with the population growth we are already seeing overheated rents start to cool off but adding rent control especially without a major government investment in housing would likely cause new housing construction to dry up quickly we can demonize big developers and others at tuesday s meeting a presenter from the renters commission claimed that of the economists who oppose rent control many are venture capitalists but at the end of the day if the housing projects don t make financial sense they aren t going to get built second regardless of whether seattle enacts rent control and whether it ever takes effect the city needs to make a massive investment in public housing sawant has made this point many times and she is 100 correct we can have a robust debate about the extent to which the private market will deliver enough housing for people earning the median seattle income or higher but there is no rational argument to be made that the market will deliver housing for people with incomes below 80 of the median income it simply won t meeting that need will require government intervention it will also require a lot of money and unfortunately today it doesn t look like either the federal or state government are likely to help much to summarize the expert consensus is clear rent control is bad policy though that is least visible in places where there is ample housing supply and government commitment to build significant additional amounts of public housing however rent control is suicide in places where there is already a shortage of housing if you want to learn more about rent control

president donald trump ramped up pressure on china to finalize a trade deal during talks in washington this week by threatening to more than double tariffs on 200 billion of the asian nation s sales to the world s largest economy and impose new import taxes in an abrupt shift from the white house after both sides had indicated negotiations were going well trump issued a pair of tweets on sunday saying he s not satisfied with the pace of progress and that the duties would increase friday trump also raised the possibility of imposing a 25 percent tariff on another 325 billion in imports from china not currently covered such a move would be hugely disruptive for the u s economy as it would hit products such as smartphones and computers that have been left off lists so far despite the happy talk from trump and others in recent days the u s has become frustrated with china s backpedaling on some of its earlier commitments including on the crucial matter of technology transfer two people familiar with the situation said that s emboldened trade hawks within the trump administration to push for a harder line including the raising of tariffs the people said twice delayed trump had twice delayed increasing tariffs on 200 billion in goods to 25 percent from 10 percent after agreeing to a dec 1 truce with chinese president xi jinping to give their negotiators time to work out a comprehensive agreement the trade deal with china continues but too slowly as they attempt to renegotiate trump said in his tweet no people familiar with the talks had indicated that the administration expected to announce a deal on friday after talks this week in washington but according to the people trump and people close to him have been irritated with the pace of progress in recent days and by leaks they viewed as intended to embarrass the president although he s eager to finish a deal trump faces political pressure ahead of his 2020 re election bid to satisfy china hawks while also resolving the tensions between the world s two largest economies and ending the tit for tat tariffs that have hurt many agricultural constituencies and cast a shadow over commodity markets a warning after trump s tweets white house economic adviser larry kudlow said on fox news that the president is issuing a warning while great progress has been made in the talks structural and enforcement issues remain he said we hope they ll come around with this deal but if they don t the president is saying guess what the tariffs will remain kudlow said trump is likely frustrated and impatient but it s a risk to try and put pressure on beijing to get a better deal said scott kennedy a china expert at the center for strategic and international studies in washington his display of pique may yield a few more concessions but it could backfire with beijing digging in its heels and calling the president s bluff kennedy said buckle up it wasn t immediately clear how china would respond but sunday s developments could unleash a sharp reaction after markets were lulled to sleep on the expectation that a trade deal was imminent said chris rupkey chief financial economist at mufg union bank in new york major u s stock indices are trading at or near record highs in part on optimism that the u s and china would soon put their bruising trade war in the rear view mirror this has all the makings of a complete disaster that could lead the stock market to crater rupkey said in a note sunday to clients buckle up your seat belt investors concluding a deal will hinge on resolving the stickiest issues in their trade dispute some of the main issues remaining include an enforcement mechanism to police the agreement and a decision over whether tariffs will be removed or stay in place according to the people who spoke on the condition of anonymity needing resolution on friday white house economic adviser kevin hassett said the trump administration was heartened to see progress with china although some issues still need to be resolved trump later told reporters that the deal itself is going along pretty well i would even say very well adding that a deal with beijing could be weeks away chinese president xi jinping s top trade envoy liu he returns to washington on wednesday for what was expected to be a closing round of trade talks trump s acting chief of staff mick mulvaney and treasury secretary steven mnuchin last week began publicly ramping up pressure on china to reach a deal warning it could still walk away from the months long negotiations trump and the chinese president will decide after the negotiations this week whether they ll meet to sign off on a pact white house spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders said thursday adding that the u s sees such a meeting as likely drag on growth trump imposed duties of 25 percent on an initial 50 billion of chinese goods last year and then 10 percent on an additional 200 billion in products in september those duties were set to rise to 25 percent on jan 1 and then again on march 1 but trump delayed that as talks continued china has imposed tariffs on 110 billion of u s exports in retaliation based on calculations by bloomberg economics tariffs at the current level add up to a 0 5 percentage point drag on china s gross domestic product growth this year an increase to 25 percent tariffs on 200 billion in chinese exports from 10 percent would raise the drag to 0 9 percentage point tariffs on all of china s exports to the u s would increase the burden to 1 5 point trump also said on sunday that tariffs paid by china are partially responsible for our great economic results although economic studies have shown it s the companies that import chinese goods and u s consumers not china itself that pay the bulk of the additional costs tariffs are taxes he must understand the chinese don t pay for these u s tariffs american families workers and companies pay for tariffs gary shapiro president of the consumer technology association said in a statement tariffs are taxes the conflict has already contributed to a slump in global trade dented business confidence and forced companies to upend their supply chains the international monetary fund cut its global outlook last month to the slowest pace since the financial crisis warning that an escalation in tariffs could push growth even lower trump has repeatedly blamed what he sees as china s unfair trade practices for the hollowing out of the u s manufacturing sector over decades he has railed against america s trade deficit in goods china which swelled last year to record 419 billion and against trade deficits in general trump launched the trade war in july after an investigation by his trade officials concluded that china routinely abuses the intellectual property rights of american companies with the presidential election scheduled for november 2020 trump may now come under pressure from his democratic rivals to defend the economic damage from the conflict

sensitively to developments in the talks between the world s two largest economies trump s announcement comes ahead of another round of talks between us and chinese officials in washington scheduled for this week white house officials were unaware on sunday afternoon whether the tweet would affect those talks the chinese delegation could decide not to come because of what is likely to be seen as an escalation by the president trump s move is a reversal of his decision in february not to increase tariffs from 10 per cent to 25 per cent on 200 billion of goods thanks to progress in the trade talks that increase will now go into effect on friday trump said in a tweet the president also said he would target another 325 billion of chinese goods with 25 per cent tariffs shortly and he

by bola akinterinwa the political environment in nigeria might truly be fantastically corrupt as suggested by some foreign friends of nigeria the issue here is not simply that nigeria is corrupt but the qualifying word fantastically why fantastically one possible explanation is to espy it from the perspective of societal disorderliness that has come to characterise political governance at all levels of national life first how does the government think in nigeria what is the philosophy of governance in nigeria has the government any philosophy guiding the protection of the national interest has the government any philosophy on the protection of nigerians abroad why would a whole ministry of foreign affairs be remiss in its duties and it would require the faculty of a senior special assistant to the president abike dabiri erewa to courageously perform the duties of the foreign ministry especially as regards saving the lives of nigerians wrongly put on death row in saudi arabia we strongly believe that under the current administration of president muhammadu buhari political governance is said to be predicated on the pursuit of national security vibrant economy and corruption free society it is most unfortunate that the general public s perception is negative on all the three areas and this is simply because of untruth in political governance regarding corruption the objective of government to neutralise corruption is quite commendable but the approach is transparently dishonest self serving and embarrassing as such corruption cannot be nipped in the bud in the nigeria of today and this is why the description of nigeria as fantastically corrupt has some elements of truth in terms of the economy it has truly been witnessing growth but the growth has not been allowed to dovetail into development nigeria s potential resources have not been allowed to be made manifest in other words nigeria is wealthy potentially but not in real life in fact many businesses are on record to be leaving the country for reasons of an inclement environment especially increasing insecurity and challenges of power outage the challenges at the domestic level are such that the government has been constrained and prevented from signing the african continental free trade agreement as well as signing the european union s economic partnership agreement as for national security this should not be simply seen in the context of carrying battles to the door steps of the boko haram and other groupings such as the massob movement for the actualisation of the sovereign state of biafra and mend movement for the emancipation of the niger delta national security should a priori be explained in the context of stomach infrastructure wellness and happiness of the people the first focus of national security should be the defence and protection of the nigerian wherever he or she may be found most unfortunately the contrary is most often the case you may wish to recall the reported statement of the minister of labour and employment dr chris ngige on the platform of the channels television s sunrise daily on wednesday 24 april 2019 regarding the situation of unemployment and brain drain in nigeria the general public was showing concern about the increasing exit of medical and paramedical practitioners from the country as reported in the punch of thursday april 25 2019 dr ngige declared as follows no i am not worried about doctors leaving the country we have surplus if you have surplus you export who says we don t have more than enough we have more than enough you can quote me there is nothing wrong in them travelling out when they go abroad they earn money and send it back home here yes we have foreign exchange earnings from them and not just oil from the perspective of the nigeria medical association nma the minister does not appear to understand the requirements by the world health organisation dr francis faduyile the president of the nma has said that is an unfortunate statement which shows that he has done nothing in medical practice the who stated that for the optimal health care to be achieved we need doctor patient ratio of one to 600 in nigeria we have 40 000 doctors taking care of 200 million people it is unfortunate we do not have enough doctors two points are noteworthy here what is the place of the who in the medical calculations of the minister of health of nigeria if 40 000 doctors currently attend to 200 million people this means that the ratio is one doctor to 5000 five thousand patients whereas the prescription by the who is 1 doctor to 600 in this regard can it be rightly said that medical doctors are in excess in nigeria if a minister of the federal republic of nigeria does not have the appropriate data to work with in policy making why should anyone expect any policy objectivity of purpose in outcome the second point is how to reconcile the who s request for optimal health care and the current healthcare situation in the country is dr ngige also suggesting that the optimal level of healthcare has been attained and therefore there is no problem with brain drain this is an expression of untruth in political governance under this same administration rape extra judicial killings as well as child abuse are also on the increase the same is true of ransacking of communities and villages suicide by young people kidnappings armed robberies especially in lagos and along abuja kaduna expressway and examination malpractices to the extent that the jamb has had to cancel many results the situation of extra judicial killings has prompted the inspector general of police igp mohammed adamu to declare that he would sanction any principal officer whose subordinates abuse the use of firearms in the words of the acting igp i have already ordered that a signal be circulated to all police commands and formations warning of dire consequences against any personnel that by their incorrigible acts deviate from accepted police culture and values more important the igp has it that the line supervisors of such officer including the area commander divisional police officer or sectional head shall be held vicariously liable for lacking supervision and shall be similarly sanctioned although the acting igp has also revealed that president buhari had also directed him to immediately implement community policing strategy across the country with the objective that such a structure will enable traditional rulers to maintain an effective cultural and social control over their subjects vide it is not yet clear whether the community policing will be allowed to be driven by honesty of purpose this point is made against the background of the intention to have special constables provided for in section 50 1 of the police act cap p19 lfn 2004 in other words the special constables will be drawn from members of the community to serve as voluntary community police officers under the coordination of the nigeria police force the acting igp further said the resort to community policing is not only an admission of the deteriorating security situation in the country but also a justification and righteousness of arguments of all those that have been calling for restructuring not only of the police force in particular but that of the polity in general president buhari never saw any goodness in the various calls before now but has for reasons of force majeure now accepted to chart the path of national restructuring with his directive on community policing without any jot of doubt institutional corruption is serious business in nigeria but everybody pretends not to know about it it is useful to provide two or three illustrations at this juncture first institutional corruption thrives well at the domestic airport it is coupled with disorderliness i asked my staff to buy me a ticket on sunday april 28 2019 to travel with arik airline lagos abuja the ticket was booked by maverick travel agency at the domestic wing of the airport the amount of the ticket was n58 000 fifty eight thousand naira only it was an economy ticket not a business or first class ticket i queried my staff why such an amount since the maximum cost of any economy class is by rule not more than n46 000 forty six thousand naira only why didn t you buy directly from the arik i asked my officer he responded that arik claimed that there was no more place for 6am flight on monday april 29 but the maverick travel agency guaranteed him a booking i took the complaint to the office of arik in abuja on my arrival there and was told that the office knew nothing about the travel agency one truth here is that the travel agency booked the ticket using the arik platform the travel agency deleted the correct amount of n45888 00 and issued a separate receipt for the payment without doubt what prevents the arik from operating very professionally by particularly compelling whoever wants to represent it to have a code of conduct i called the travel agency to inform of my intention to get the matter prosecuted because i was not prepared to pay n12 000 as service charge for simply booking an airline ticket no airport reception no lounge no tea or coffee service no security escort absolutely no other benefit than just reserving a place the travel agency did not want any police matter and offered to refund part of the money with much begging i accepted a n5000 refund this is stealing by a corrupt method the intention is ab initio to steal one interesting argument of the travel agency is that arik does not pay it any commission why enjoy services of a travel agency and refuse to appreciate this is another expression of corruption in fact at the checking in counter it is also disorderliness galore touts are allowed in through business passengers corridor affinity wings clientèle cannot lay claim to any privilege rowdiness and struggles between those who would want to go by 6am but scheduled for 7am flight turned the area into another roaring market unfortunately arik flight hardly leaves at 6 am on this very day it taxied off at 6 27 am i took time to monitor various acts of indiscipline and refused to beg anyone for help but it dawned on one staff who noticed that i was asking for names of some of them to attend to me true genuine people on the queue were unnecessarily ridiculed how do we explain this type of assault on the integrity of honest people does the minister of aviation want to claim not to know about all these indecent activities in the airport national image is tainted this is a manifestation of institutional corruption and societal indiscipline to which we all acquiesce foreigners see all these and laugh write reports back home but deal decisively with erring nigerians back home what about violations of simple traffic code let us begin with the case of lagos state for example the state of most spectacular societal indiscipline and disorderliness in nigeria is lagos state it is a state that prides itself state of excellence the question to ask however is simple in which areas should we be talking about situations of excellence show me your friend and i will tell you whom you are is a common saying it simply means let first appearance suggest further details about you visible societal indiscipline in lagos state begins with the lawlessness of the commercial vehicles popularly referred to as danfo they do not have any respect for any traffic rule they operate with impunity and are always in a haste to make money and therefore strongly believe that any road traffic offence could be settled by money giving and true enough whoever wants to verify this observation should go to ikorodu road and see how danfos ply the reserved brt way in the glare of law enforcement agents meant to arrest them why is government unable to discipline danfo the yellow commercial vehicle drivers the answer is well known corruption dishonesty untruth at the level of government and true enough road traffic wardens in lagos state set traps for motorists in many parts of lagos state there are no road signs especially for one way but the traffic officers hide in a corner and arrest unsuspecting drivers i was arrested in one area of mushin by oshodi apapa expressway and i refused to settle anyone because there was no road sign indicating the street was one way only i not only went with the officers to their office to invite their superior officers to come and show me where there was a prohibiting road sign we went to the street to discover that the road sign had fallen down long time and that the writings on the very rusted metal any sign post has faded perhaps more interestingly i noted that the traffic warden who took me to his area office also took the same one way for which he arrested me i told the head of the office that if i was guilty of taking one way what makes it legal for you as road traffic wardens to also take the same way and you would not be guilty this scenario clearly shows how political governance is carried out in the whole of nigeria government agents can do anything and they are protected if the abiding citizens do the same the story is different even though i was allowed to go free without penalty i offered to give them n15 000 fifteen thousand naira for the acquisition of signposts to be put in transparent areas of the street as a special contribution to community development to guide other motorists the truth is that after i left a receipt was said to have been issued to me not for buying a new sign post but for traffic rule violation i made efforts to take the matter to court but my family vehemently prevailed on me i was not happy that i was prevented from fighting societal ills this is why corruption thrives on fertile ground and this is the nature of political governance in nigeria but who wants to bother for any right thinking person acts of indiscipline and particularly violations of traffic rules can be made a good source of revenue for the government and at the same time build a new society that will be completely free from societal ills as well as create thousands of employment opportunities for instance the government can recruit about three thousand fresh graduates give them training on traffic code and station them on all lagos roads the house of assembly should be required to pass a special new bill on violations of road traffic rules especially on driving against traffic or on the pavement meant for pedestrians making it a more serious offence and punishable by at least one year imprisonment without any option of fine for minor offences of beating the traffic light let people pay nothing less than n25 000 twenty five thousand naira at the time of arrest every day thereafter should attract one thousand naira daily with this type of draconian approach it is not only the danfo drivers that will first learn to quickly adjust private motorists will also quickly begin to comply with the rules and by so doing discipline will gradually be instilled government will generate revenues from traffic lawlessness accidents on the roads will be reduced without doing this lagos cannot rightly claim to be a state of excellence lagos state is currently a state of lawlessness where government agents take the law into their hands to terrorise the law abiding residents excellence of a state should not be simply defined by provision of road repairs it is dignity of the people compliance with the rule of law decency and quality of government agents as well as extent of the people in political governance that should be required to do so this has not been so because political governance is largely predicated on untruth dishonesty of purpose and this brings us to the controversy over inec s alleged replacement of election servers and its linkages to the mueller s report in the united states pdp inec and us mueller s report mr robert mueller was the special investigation counsel charged with the responsibility of investigating the alleged russian intervention or intrusion into the 2016 us presidential election the investigation which began in 2017 and was concluded in march 2019 was variously referred to as the mueller investigation the mueller probe the russian investigation etc mueller submitted a report of 448 four hundred and forty eight pages but which the us attorney general william barr summarised into only four pages and then submitted to some political leaders and the heads of various committees in the us congress many observers found that there were inconsistencies between the summarised and the original report which prompted the democrats to want to find out the exact truth about what was truly stated in the original report for this purpose the house judiciary chairman jerry nadler organised a hearing and asked the attorney general to come and testify there for various reasons especially that the attorney general was also interviewed for more than five hours the day before by the senate judicial committee the attorney general refused to attend and to reveal the vital information required by the congress this has compelled mr jerry nadler to request for the unedited full report given by robert mueller without which mr william barr would be held in contempt of the congress which is regarded as a crime the time limit given the attorney general was may 1 2019 in the words of the house judiciary chairman the committee is prepared to make every realistic effort to reach an accommodation with the department but if the department persists in its baseless refusal to comply with a validly issued subpoena the committee will move to contempt proceedings and seek further legal recourse what is important about this point is the aspect of untruth and dishonesty in the us presidential system of government there is freedom to do anything including to tell lies and especially for government agents to deceive the people the truth is that the special investigation counsel wrote a report the summary of which the us attorney general consciously distorted and presented to the congress for information but because the us institutions has several levels of checks and balances it has not been easy for the attorney general to falsify information and escape this is precisely the linkage between the mueller report and its distorted presentation to the congress of the united states on the one hand and the case between the people s democratic party pdp and the independent national electoral commission inec on the other the pdp alleged last week that the inec was replacing all the servers used for the collation of the presidential election results at the state and abuja headquarters of the inec why the pdp is insinuating that the electoral body might be doing so to quickly cover up the alleged election rigging by the incumbent ruling party and government the alert raised by the pdp is apt because the pdp has already referred the matter to the election tribunal to determine whether or not the apc candidate muhammadu buhari really won the presidential election there is no disputing the fact that the february 23rd elections were fraught with violence logistics problems and rigging all of which were a resultant of political dishonesty and chicanery if it is true that the inec is replacing the servers it can only suggest one thing inec is precisely trying to obstruct justice in the very manner president donald trump is currently trying to prevent the truth from being told to the american public the inec is also by so doing making nonsense of its independence the independent character of the inec is called to question the international responsibility of the government of nigeria is also at stake in both the contexts of the united states it is difficult for public officials to tell lies and go scot free but the contrary is the case in nigeria nigeria has now become a new terra cognita for untruth dishonesty and political chicanery and this is why the government cannot successfully cope with the spate of ongoing violent killings in virtually all the nooks and crannies of nigeria the time for unconditional restructuring in order to preserve national unity has indeed come and president buhari s approval of community policing is the first pointer to this it is not known in political history where battles fought against the truth have ever been won truth is indestructible no matter for how long the truth is kept under the cooler sooner or later archival records cannot but be released to the public after all the records of many centuries are now in the public domain the

file photo the federal reserve building is pictured in washington dc u s august 22 2018 reuters chris wattie file photo by ann saphir and howard schneider palo alto calif reuters federal reserve policymakers fear they are ill equipped to battle the next recession under their current inflation targeting approach and this year are well into an effort to vet new strategies for managing interest rates in a world of muted inflation and low borrowing costs but for the u s central bankers and monetary policy experts who converged in palo alto friday to discuss available options the challenge was clear not only will it be difficult to settle on a better framework before the next recession hits figuring out how to explain it to the public so that it actually works will be a major challenge indeed just to explain their ideas to each other fed policymakers and academics at the hoover institution s annual conference displayed slide after slide crammed with equations lengthy bullet points and nearly indecipherable charts and while most of the phd economists in the audience presumably understood the theories i think where people disagree is do the assumptions of the model really play out in real life cleveland fed bank president loretta mester said in an interview on the sidelines of the conference in other words what will really work when central bankers around the world reached for unconventional tools like bond buying and forward guidance to fight the 2007 2009 financial crisis they thought they were facing once in a lifetime conditions but a decade on from the end of the great recession it s clear the fed is dealing with a new economic norm neither inflation nor interest rates are expected to rise much even with u s unemployment at a near 50 year low that leaves the central bank with much less leeway to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy than it historically has had so this year with the u s economy on an even keel interest rate policy on pause and an expansion set to reach record length this summer fed policymakers figure they have a bit of breathing room to figure out how to make policy more effective when the next recession or shock comes along among the ideas commit to making up for bouts of low inflation with periods of above target inflation rely on simple policy rules to take the guesswork out of rate decisions and use negative interest rates to force businesses to invest and banks to lend during downturns shock absorbers for a new world all would their advocates say act as shock absorbers to cushion economic weakness and shorten recessions each would differ to greater or lesser degrees from the fed s current approach by which it aims for 2 percent inflation and a loosely defined ideal of full employment and all would depend critically on households businesses and financial markets understanding the framework and reacting accordingly average inflation targeting is the framework option that has attracted the most support so far the idea new york fed president john williams explained is to aim for inflation to average out at 2 percent over a given period say a year and a half when inflation falls during periods of economic stress the central bank would respond by keeping easy policy in place until inflation rises above 2 percent and stays there for a time if households and businesses know they can count on higher inflation in the future they will borrow and spend more during recessions which would theoretically speed the economy s return to health but for the plan to work spenders will have to believe the fed really will drive inflation higher in the future negative rates would stimulate the economy by punishing businesses for not putting money to work in the economy if they just keep their money at the bank they ll end up paying for the privilege for such a regime to be accepted however ordinary people would need to feel sure they wouldn t be punished as well policy rules boost fed credibility by laying out a clear path for rates based on the economy cleveland fed s mester said but if those rules are applied too rigidly they won t deliver the outcomes the fed wants not everyone at the conference was sold on the benefits of a new framework not even the fed policymakers who were presenting some of the ideas the bar for change is high san francisco fed chief mary daly said it can be costly to make mistakes in this space st louis fed chief james bullard went further experimenting with the way the world s biggest central bank does business would unleash chaos in global financial markets still the group seemed keen on exploring new ideas and the fed has half a dozen more events around the framework review planned for the rest of the year most in the audience gave the fed credit for tackling the issue said dartmouth college economics professor andy levin the fed needs to find something new reporting by ann saphir and howard schneider editing by andrea ricci
like many countries india s largest cities are congested but congestion pricing won t work here because mobility is affected by other factors besides vehicle traffic urban economic development indicators such as higher income levels and higher motorization rates are generally associated with better overall mobility chiefly because people can spend their time more productively than idling away in traffic snarls among the tools urban planners typically use to increase mobility is congestion pricing such as new york city s recent decision to impose tolls on vehicles entering its busiest areas however such mechanisms will not work in urban india where planners must focus more on so called uncongested mobility than on reducing actual congestion caused by vehicular traffic uncongested mobility essentially refers to the speeds vehicles can reach after navigating everyday obstructions such as pedestrians hawkers stray dogs and cattle that is the central finding of a research paper titled mobility and congestion in urban india one thing that surprised us the most is that on average across urban india there is not actually that much congestion said the paper s co author wharton real estate professor gilles duranton traffic flows are slow but they are slow all the time the paper s other co authors are prottoy a akbar from the university of pittsburgh victor couture of the university of california berkeley ejaz ghani lead economist at the world bank and adam storeygard of tufts university notably they found that urbanization and rapid growth don t have to lead to gridlock indeed economic development can bring better infrastructure and also improve mobility and while india does have a big mobility problem in nearly all cases the authors said it is not congestion but other hurdles bad roads bad design and potholes that slow people down as such vehicle speeds within the cities showed little variation at different hours of the day rush hour or not fast and slow cities differences in urban mobility or traffic speeds also vary widely across large cities indeed a factor of nearly two separates the fastest and slowest cities chandigarh a planned city that is the joint capital of the northwestern punjab and haryana states is a particularly fast city while kolkata formerly calcutta capital of west bengal state in the east is a particularly slow city another interesting finding was that mobility is better in cities with a more grid like network such as in chandigarh we were the first to provide the result that the shape of the road network determines how fast you can move said duranton that s what the authors call uncongested mobility the study also noted that travel is generally slow in indian cities even outside peak hours even the central part of chicago considered a slow city and one of the most congested locations in the us is generally faster than one of the fastest indian cities chandigarh the paper stated moreover the researchers found that traffic is slower in denser or more populated indian cities such cities display a hill shaped relationship between city per capita income and mobility which means that even as per capital income rises mobility tends to rise up to a point after which it declines that means a city s mobility is related to characteristics of its road network and not income levels the paper said when congestion pricing doesn t work the study noticed that wide variations in mobility across indian cities were primarily due to uncongested mobility not congestion as such congestion pricing would have little impact that s why a 10 improvement in uncongested mobility for instance could bring more gains than implementing congestion pricing in urban india here s another case due to slow uncongested mobility a very poor city like varanasi benares is slower than average at all times even at night in the absence of traffic the paper said duranton said it was not entirely clear to him why urban india has slow mobility in the middle of the day or later in the day in most parts of the world when traffic is slow it is because there are lots of vehicles he said in india you have many users on the roads not just vehicles but those that use them for parking for selling and consuming stuff children playing and animals which is a nontrivial issue the study s findings are based on data culled from more than 22 million trips in 154 large indian cities over two months in 2016 the paper s findings challenge conventional wisdom that traffic congestion is the main reason why some cities are slow and some are fast in fact kolkata showed up as the least congested of the four big metros the others are mumbai new delhi and chennai but it was also the slowest because of low uncongested mobility this distinction has important policy implications because uncongested speed cannot be improved by congestion pricing ride sharing promotion or restriction or other policies often proposed to combat congestion the study said duranton added kolkata is extremely slow even at 3 am in the morning there is no way you can go more than 25 km an hour even when there is nobody on the roads however congestion alleviating policies do work in some cases duranton said they could be useful in some of the most congested cities such as bangalore and mumbai but they are unlikely to make much of a difference in cities where traffic is chronically slow such as varanasi uncongested speed in the slowest cities cannot be improved by ride sharing congestion pricing or other restrictions and it may be more beneficial to invest in infrastructure he said while the study did not isolate the exact causes of slow traffic it pointed to poor infrastructure as the likely culprit cities with more primary roads and those laid out in a more regular grid are faster he added improving urban mobility duranton examined some ways in which urban mobility could be improved in india first there is a case to be made for improving roads in urban india improving mobility irrespective of congestion he said the low hanging fruits are probably better management of roads better traffic management and making sure people are not blocking intersections subways and rail will bring higher carrying capacity duranton said however subways are expensive to build ambitious subway projects called the metro are underway in new delhi and mumbai but there is no guarantee that they will decongest the roads by any meaningful degree the problem is as soon as you free up space on the roads there are 20 cars waiting to use it he said increased transit options such as subways and rail don t necessarily reduce congestion because if you improve travel conditions more people will travel he noted building new roads is a costly proposition so a far cheaper option might be fixing potholes and preventing people from parking everywhere duranton added however the economic gains from those measures are probably limited he said for example traffic in new delhi moves at 15 km an hour but reduced congestion will not increase speeds to more than 18 km or 20 km an hour as evidenced by speeds even in the middle of the night he added it is not a huge gain by contrast traffic speeds in the center of chicago average 30 km an hour the researchers believe their new approach to studying traffic conditions may be useful throughout the developing world where there has been a lack of comprehensive data about urban transportation urban planners would find useful pointers in the study often we find large shopping malls or industrial parks coming up with scant regard to the traffic density their locations could take creating congestion said duranton other options such as dedicated lanes for freight traffic bike trails pedestrian sidewalks and well planned traffic signals could also help however some of those solutions also bring challenges better traffic management is a no brainer duranton said however reserving roadways for different uses have pros and cons he noted having dedicated bus lanes and bike lanes for example has drawbacks as well because of enforcement issues people are likely to use them as temporary parking spots so it needs to be enforced and that needs to be designed duranton said bus lanes could increase the carrying capacity of the roads but if you keep one lane free for one bus to go every 30 minutes i am not going to be convinced that that is a solution in order to be used efficiently you need 2 000 travelers per hour unless you are able to do that your bus lane is not potentially efficient the same challenge applies to dedicated bike lanes if you kill one traffic lane so you can have 20 bicycles an hour i am not sure it is a good idea duranton said bike lanes should be on smaller streets it will also be safer for them a big challenge in india and across the developing world in latin america and asia is the increased use of motorcycles which chinese manufacturers have made more affordable but he said the bikes also cause pollution and accidents for instance in bogota their number has shot up from zero to a third or half the number of all vehicles over the past decade he noted significance of the study the study s findings are based on data culled from more than 22 million trips in 154 large indian cities over two months in 2016 the authors say their research provides the first systematic investigation of urban mobility across cities in a developing country in a first the study s researchers used a novel data infrastructure to obtain systematic views of the actual mobility of people which google maps provided at a low cost the study is important for three reasons first there is an extreme paucity of useful knowledge about urban transportation especially in developing countries the authors said as a first building block towards a more serious knowledge base on urban transportation some stylized facts are needed they noted for instance there is a need to know how slow is travel in developing cities beyond anecdotal evidence offered by travelers policymakers also need a clear understanding of the differences between cities between different parts of the same city and across times of day within the same city they hope their results methodology and data sources can help guide policy and future research on urban transportation in developing countries the study s findings challenge the popular view that urbanization and economic development lead to ever larger cities and increased rates of motorization which eventually lead to complete gridlock to be sure it found evidence of congestion in the largest indian cities and a strong association between congestion and household access to motorized vehicles however economic development also brings about better travel infrastructure which facilitates uncongested mobility it stated another takeaway for policymakers from the study is that better mobility is associated with a more regular grid network and more primary roads that clarity helps because providing an assessment of the determinants of mobility to guide policy is fundamental especially when urban transportation in developing countries is prioritized for massive investments the paper said indeed transportation is the largest sector of lending by the world bank and represents more than 20 of its net commitments as of 2016 the authors pointed out the lack of sufficient urban land for building roadways is widely perceived to be the chief cause behind slow mobility and urban congestion and much of the investments try to address that they stated future research the study raises three challenges the authors said one there is a need for a new methodology or a new approach to measure various forms of mobility from trip information and to decompose them into uncongested mobility and delays caused by congestion second they highlight the unavailability of a comprehensive source of data about urban transportation in indian cities for their study they designed a trove of trips and sampled each trip at different times on different days or what they call counterfactual trips those were not actual trips but they mimic some characteristics of trips taken by households in other countries as it happens they found that their city mobility indices showed little variance from those they mimicked another challenge was in consistently defining and measuring the cities they tracked for trips their solution was to rely on a wide variety of sources including the census of india the free openstreetmap and satellite imagery however a shortcoming of their methodology was its inability to capture the richness in the data they would have gained through a survey duranton said the views expressed in this article are the author s own and do not necessarily reflect fair observer s editorial policy

in 2018 i voted to re elect fred keller to represent the 85th legislative district in the pennsylvania general assembly because i believed his experience knowledge and eight years of seniority would benefit his constituents i have mixed feelings about him seeking to replace tom marino in washington in the special election why i do not support the agenda of president donald trump that caters to the corporations and the wealthy by increasing the national debt at the expense of the disappearing middle class i also believe a mexican wall is an insane waste of dollars instead of pesos as a state representative mr keller supported tom corbett s budget cuts that burdened the smaller poorer rural school districts by cutting programs and teachers by closing neighborhood schools and by increasing local school taxes especially property taxes fred keller also supported the increase in the pennsylvania gas tax that is now the highest in the nation and that is also being used to pay the pennsylvania state police at the expense of fixing our deteriorating bridges and roadways mr keller will be elected easily because the 12th congressional district is heavily gerrymandered for a republican and the big money interests are supporting his election in spite of my concerns i believe that fred keller will be an honest hard working republican representative for his constituents david l faust selinsgrove

pushing back persuading companies to look beyond academic credentials and to instead hire people based on their skills a growing number of businesses are listening in the past few years apple google ibm and other high profile companies have stripped the bachelor s degree requirement from many of their positions if this movement continues to gather steam researchers say it could aid not only individual job seekers but also the u s economy by helping businesses hold onto workers and by boosting the middle class degree inflation in 2014 the labor market analysis firm burning glass technologies tried to capture the extent of degree inflation the firm compared the percentage of people in a given occupation say executive assistant who have a bachelor s degree with the percentage of job listings for that occupation requiring a bachelor s degree who you have working for you and who you want to have working for you in the future aren t always the same said burning glass ceo matthew sigelman sigelman found that 19 percent of current executive assistants had a bachelor s degree but that 65 percent of job listings for the position asked for one a credentials gap of 46 percent in surveying broader groups of occupations burning glass found a credentials gap of 26 percent for management jobs 21 percent for computer and math jobs and 13 percent for sales jobs in late 2017 a research project led by the harvard business school a workforce organization called grads of life and the consulting firm accenture concluded in a report dismissed by degrees that employers appear to be closing off their access to the two thirds of the u s workforce that does not have a four year college degree the researchers estimated that 6 2 million jobs were at risk of degree inflation they cited research showing that the proportion of job listings requiring a four year degree increased by more than 10 percentage points from 2007 to 2010 that timespan should look familiar the great recession lasted from december 2007 to june 2009 unemployment spiked and employers stocked up on college graduates without having to pay a premium in wages some of that is legitimate where the job is getting more technical said dismissed by degrees co author joe fuller a harvard business school professor but employers want more than technical skills they want characteristics like attention to detail problem solving working with a team one of the major reasons degree inflation is so common is because employers use it as proxy for those kinds of soft skills fuller said using a four year degree as a proxy for employability shuts out the most economically vulnerable job seekers it hurts employers too fuller and his harvard colleague researcher manjari raman found in their report degree holders command an 11 to 30 percent wage premium yet fail to justify that premium in productivity and other outcomes it takes longer to fill jobs when filtering for four year degrees and degree holders change jobs more quickly nonetheless according to harvard s survey of 600 business and human resource leaders 61 percent of respondents reported tossing resumes without four year degrees even if the applicant was qualified that survey also revealed that 63 percent of respondents had trouble filling middle skills jobs andy van kleunen ceo of the national skills coalition attributed that trouble to public policies that push bachelor s degrees as a one size fits all solution rather than training workers for specific middle skill positions the national skills coalition which lobbies policymakers and employers to invest in workers skills wants federal pell grants to be available not just for students seeking degrees but also for workers who want to take short term courses that they could apply on the job immediately but part of employers inability to fill middle skills jobs can be attributed to degree inflation fuller s report encouraged employers to push back against the trend once the logic of resisting degree inflation takes root in an organization it soon permeates different aspects of the organization s culture and eventually embeds itself at the heart of its strategy the report states a 1 percent market after years of being criticized for a lack of diversity companies especially in the technology world are looking for ways to make their workplaces more inclusive and a tight labor market there were more than 7 million job openings in the u s as of february has employers in many sectors scrambling for talent for decades at many companies that i worked for i wasn t allowed to hire unless somebody had a four year degree said trish torizzo the chief information officer for houghton mifflin harcourt but today she said supply is so low that people are almost being forced to think more creatively about how they operate houghton mifflin harcourt stripped the four year degree requirement from information technology positions including web developer last summer and the number of applications that made it through their initial screening doubled to screen candidates the company looks for a tech stack a list of programming languages and tools a candidate knows houghton mifflin harcourt then revisited hiring practices for sales positions which are heavy on soft skills at the urging of roberta rainville the vice president for talent acquisitions rainville knew it was time for a change when the company found itself unable to hire a great candidate for a sales position they interviewed splendidly she said and then it was well i want to hire them and i was like yeah you can t and they re like why not and i m like because your job description says bachelor s degree required i said that s got togo rainville had to persuade 10 people from the sales leadership team before she could make the change some folks were like we can t take the bachelor s degree off we re sending the wrong message to our teacher population that we re selling to she said ultimately everyone signed off and in september the company stripped the four year degree requirement from some of its sales jobs and three months later did the same for software engineering jobs now 11 percent of applicants who make it through the interview process for an entry level sales position have no credential beyond a high school diploma another 11 percent have an associate degree previously all had bachelor s degrees as the company retools its pipeline it is working with organizations in boston communities hoping to attract job applicants it had previously failed to reach so far houghton mifflin s relationship with resilient coders has resulted in the company hiring tillman french and another web developer resilient coders founder david delmar has offered to tailor part of the organization s curriculum to houghton mifflin harcourt s needs resilient coders has already built a curriculum for wayfair a rapidly growing home furnishings company that generated 6 8 billion in revenue last year a goal that we ve set something we think it s reasonable to achieve in the next couple of seasons is to have potentially as much as half of entry level software developers come from boot camps whereas historically it s been 100 percent out of universities said deborah poole wayfair s global head of talent acquisition in late march wayfair hosted researchers employers and representatives of boston s economic development office at an event called untapped to release a research report on redefining hiring in the area the report is part of a regional effort to bring economic opportunity to bostonians who lack a four year degree more than 50 percent of adults in the city there is a huge amount of talent in this market that we are not talking to poole said when the time came for audience questions the first to speak up was delmar from resilient coders he asked a panel including city leaders researchers and executives a question that was met with silence followed by nervous laughter is it time will it ever be time to ban the b a requirement from coding jobs closing the gap with more than 20 four year colleges and universities boston is known as a college town but only 25 percent of the city s black and latino adults have a bachelor s degree and the boston metro area ranks sixth in the nation for income inequality the regional economy might be thriving but many of its jobs are taken by people who come from outside massachusetts when it comes to the labor market said marybeth campbell executive director of skillworks a workforce group dedicated to low income low skilled bostonians our two year community colleges are competing with our four year schools and those four year schools are competing with three or four schools here harvard mit the staff at resilient coders sees this racial and economic inequality up close if you re looking for someone you re going to use your networks said rouguiatou diallo chief of staff at resilient coders in a segregated america your networks are going to be looking the same as you most of the time the four year degree requirement is a habit diallo said but habits change so what if it becomes a habit that one of your pipelines is a boot camp program faisal africawala 29 a cambridge resident who emigrated from india in 2010 worked for years at 7 eleven convenience stores and a whole foods market making 8 50 to 11 per hour in 2018 he entered a free nine month program at a workforce organization called just a start training for the biomedical industry halfway through the program a pharmaceutical manufacturer in the boston suburbs hired him as a manufacturing technician on the second shift he wears protective gowns and fills vials with medicine in sterile rooms and is checked for microbes every time he goes through the door africawala said he earns 19 26 per hour and gets health insurance life insurance and a retirement plan i m already looking to buy a house which i never thought i would even have said africawala who takes what overtime he can get it s only been six months but i ve managed to save ten thousand bucks in a survey of its alumni dating to 2004 just a start said the 143 respondents indicated that they have seen an average salary increase of 14 778 per year compared to their previous jobs the program reaches out to employers and encourages them to consider candidates who don t have four year degrees said gina plata just a start s director of education and training newer programs have harnessed technology to draw employers attention to job candidates skills rather than their degrees after coming across eye tracking research showing that recruiters spend an average of just seven seconds skimming a resume grads of life developed the 7 second resume a video in which job seekers highlight one skill they can bring to a job the developers of the job listing portal skillist encourage users to highlight their skills rather than degrees and they persuade employers to shape their listings around skills wayfair and about 10 other employers have signed on new research shows that employers are recognizing that degree inflation can work against their interests preventing them from finding the workers they need economist alicia sasser modestino an associate professor at northeastern university and two colleagues found that employers loosened educational requirements when the economy recovered following the great recession from 2010 to 2014 the proportion of listings asking for a four year degree dipped a quarter of a percentage point for every 1 percent drop in a region s unemployment rate that raises a troubling question if employers turn to skill based hiring during a tight labor market will they start hiring based on four year degrees again during the next economic downturn that s the question that keeps me up at night grads of life principal elyse rosenblum said with a chuckle and why we are working so hard and so fast to try to instill these practices the other lingering question is whether nondegree hires will stay and advance at their workplaces that is absolutely critical rosenblum said the future is always on ryan tillman french s mind both his own future and that of the community that raised him he s collecting backpacks to give out to children in his old detroit neighborhood and eventually he wants to buy a house there even if he doesn t move back right away one day he d like to run his own company in the meantime tillman french believes there s a path for advancement at houghton mifflin harcourt he already makes 65 000 a year a rebuke to a culture and an economy that exalts a bachelor s degree as the gold standard for upward mobility while young adults stagger under the weight ofthe nation s record 1 5 trillion in outstanding student loan debt my success is truly determined by me tillman french said how much work i put into this is how much success i m going to get

watch alert korea the north tests missiles again oil saudis to increase production gold firms up on trade concerns trade it appears the trade truce between china and the us is coming to a close as

talks and china s attempts to renegotiate talks resume in washington dc on wednesday when china s top negotiator liu he meets lighthizer and mnuchin for what is hoped to be the last round of talks before a final meeting between xi and trump markets have heavily priced in a trade deal and trump s increased tariff threat may be unsettling for risk appetite for the start of the trading week if talks completely fall off a cliff we could see major pressure for us stocks who are just a stone s throw from record highs rba rbnz commodity currencies are trading sharply lower following trump s tariff threat and growing bets that the we could see a fresh round of rate cuts from the rba and rbnz both central banks are having live meetings while expectations are slightly higher for the rbnz to

denuclearization talks between the us and north korea us secretary of state mike pompeo stated there is still a path forward for negotiations and that the tests this week did not pose a threat to the us or south korea oil saudi arabia is expected to deliver an increase in production to makeup for the iran disruptions saudi aramco has raised their prices to asia and europe while cutting prices to the us crude prices for arab light are at the highest premium since july and current demand seems to be strong enough to handle the increase in europe and asia the focus has now shifted back to what will opec and allies do regarding their production cut agreement opec not only needs to worry about a major reversal with oil prices but they need to make sure they stay relevant and do not see members abandon the cartel crude prices may only stabilize on the announcement of a production cut extension by opec improving demand globally will prevent any major selloff but it appears bullish bet on crude may be over positioned and we could see an easier path lower for prices production is expected to increase from the big three american saudis and russians an environment that will be difficult for crude trade much higher despite a slowly developing rebound in global demand on the venezuelan front opposition leader juan guadio noted he will not rule the option of working with us military a move that would be frowned by most of the nation s neighbors last week s failed attempt by guaido to overthrow maduro was a major blow the talk of working with the us may just be political
