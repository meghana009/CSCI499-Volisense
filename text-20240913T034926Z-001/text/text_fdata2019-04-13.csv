mmt is a spectacularly dem idea economists are good for one thing and that is creating theories the trouble is those theories are often wrong this is why economics is often called the dismal science such is the case with the latest economic soup de jour modern monetary theory or mmt for short in this article we take a deep dive into mmt what is it who s behind it or against it whether it could work and what it would mean for gold what is mmt modern monetary theory is a new way of approaching the us federal budget that is both unconventional and absurd it posits that rather than obsessing about how large the debt has grown over 2 trillion and the ongoing annual deficits that fuel debt we should focus on spending specifically how the government can target certain spending programs that will cause minimal inflation fiscal policy on steroids is according to its proponents to be the new engine of us growth and prosperity government is therefore given a free pass on spending because the only thing that we have to worry about with the national debt is inflation curb inflation and the debt can keep growing with no consequences this is because the us government can never run out of money it just keeps printing money because dollars are always in demand with the dollar being the reserve currency and commodities are traded in dollars one of mmt s main proponents is stephanie kelton an economics professor who advised bernie sanders 2016 presidential campaign among the statements she makes in a video explaining mmt kelton says the us dollar is a simple public monopoly in other words the united states currency comes from the united states government that means the federal government doesn t need to come up with the money in order to be able to spend it just prints money and spends it from this follows the logical conclusion that deficits don t really matter the only thing that matters is inflation according to kelton the only potential risk with the national debt increasing over time is inflation to the extent that you don t believe the us has a long term inflation problem then you shouldn t believe the us has a long term national debt problem it is no surprise that this economic theory is gaining traction now given that the trump administration has been hacking away at social programs while heaping on national debt even more than trump s predecessor president obama at the same time many americans are feeling left behind in an economy that has done quite well while trump promised better times for the average citizen through his campaign and the 1 5 trillion tax cut at the end of 2017 in fact only the richest americans have seen the benefits through the stock market rally that lasted three quarters of 2018 and massive share buybacks in september 2018 another 3 8 trillion in cuts was passed the top 20 of earners got 40 of the tax cuts and jobs act and the top 1 received 34 the banks made record profits of 28 8 billion in 2018 the financial pages and websites are predicting a recession within the next year to two years if a recession occurs and trump is dumped from office many will blame his demise on making inequality in america worse modern monetary theory is seen as a way of redressing such vast disparities between wealth and poverty writes brian maher the managing editor of the daily reckoning has enriched the 1 for these many years while every man jack has scratched by on the leavings we will be instructed in the need for an economic system that meets the needs of real americans an economy of the people by the people and for the people there is certainly a touch of justice in this view the existing arrangement leans heavily toward wall street and the rich meantime real wages for most americans have scarcely improved for decades if not actually fallen is it coincidence that modern monetary theory mmt is receiving a hearing these days in democratic circles it pledges to fund medicare for all free college tuition guaranteed employment at a 15 per hour minimum no less and a green new deal to rescue earth from man something for everyone or rather everything for everyone and do not worry about paying for it others say mmt is the left s answer to supply side economics a theory picked up by american conservatives most recently trump supply side theory says that tax cuts will invigorate the economy by trickling down to the masses encouraging them to spend thereby reducing or eliminating deficits even if spending went up we can see that hasn t gone so well for trump the 45th president s budget deficits as a percentage of gdp are likely to exceed any other president s during an economic expansion forbes reported last year mmt believers think that taxes aren t even needed to fund the government all the treasury department needs to do is print more money aoc inspired modern monetary theory and the ideas of the democratic party s far left fit like hand and glove pleas for universal medical coverage free college tuition and a minimum 15 per hour wage can all be paid for by setting the money presses free the theory has become a vehicle for far left spokesperson alexandria ocasio cortez aoc to pay for her new green deal a 14 page manifesto of climate change related spending costed at up to 1 trillion mmt is clearly a democratic driven initiative with apparently few if any adherents on the republican side in contrast the gop is favoring a return to the gold standard since president nixon removed the link between the us dollar and gold in 1971 the idea of reviving the gold standard has been kicked around in response to the humungous pile of debt the us has accumulated particularly after quantitative easing qe shifted hundreds of billions worth of us treasury bills and mortgage backed securities onto the federal reserve s books president ronald reagan established a gold commission in 1981 with the aim of studying a return to a dollar backed by gold in 2012 the republican party mused about setting up a commission to re establish the link between the greenback and bullion before its party convention in tampa bay florida and trump is quietly a big supporter of gold reportedly saying during the 2016 presidential campaign bringing back the gold standard would be very hard to do but boy would it be wonderful we d have a standard on which to base our money some of trump s rivals on the republican ticket in 2016 were also bullion bulls ted cruz mike huckabee and ben carson have all implied some degree of support for the gold standard states a motley fool article the idea was even given a thumbs up in a 2015 gallup poll says fool contributor sean williams thirty nine percent of respondents said they approved of the gold standard versus 15 who disapproved although that leaves 46 undecided people who probably were either born after 1971 or have little to no knowledge of it i just mention that because it s interesting to see such a stark division of views lining up between democrats and republicans over economics trump recently said he wants to fill two open seats on the federal reserve board of governors with two gold bugs stephen moore and hermain cain have both said they support a return to a us dollar backed by gold on the other side of the political spectrum though it appears that mmt is gaining credibility trump lately has been pressuring the fed to do an interest rate cut maybe another round of quantitative easing q4 despite the lack of urgency the financial crisis that precipitated the first qe zero hedge reports that trump s exhortation that the federal reserve usher in qe4 by cutting interest rates stoked a frenzy of speculation that the world s most powerful central bank might be closer to outright debt monetization aka helicopter money than mainstream economists had realized of course debt monetization is a central plank of the mmt program the term helicopter money was popularized by former fed chairman ben bernanke it refers to the government supplying large amounts of money directly to the public as though scattered from a helicopter versus quantitative easing whereby the central bank prints money and then purchases assets bonds or securities with that money one more point here while republicans favor fiscal austerity something that would be demanded of the treasury under a gold standard and the democrats at least the most left leaning want the opposite complete freedom to run deficits it s also fascinating to see that both parties have added spectacularly to the debt trump and obama have both budgeted more for defense than any adminstration since world war ii and according to a marketwatch graphic of which presidents added most to the federal debt numbers 44 and number 45 are among the six biggest debt accumulators obama is first at 8 59 trillion how to a recent hoisington investment management co report imagines how mmt might work in practice first the federal reserve act would have to be rewritten to allow the us central bank to directly fund government expenditure second the us treasury then issues zero maturity some proponents are calling for a trillion dollar hundred year bond and zero interest rate debt to the federal reserve third the fed then credits the proper government accounts would it work that s the two trillion dollar question the answer after conducting a web search of the chances of mmt s success of course is no below is a smattering of criticisms pulled from a number of news sites blog posts etc the commonly agreed upon tenet that a functional financial system depends on an independent central bank to set monetary policy free of political influence is one reason why economists have been aghast at president trump for publicly demanding that the fed lower interest rates to think that if there s massive inflation that congress and the president will be able to act is completely whacko says marc goldwein policy director at the committee for a responsible federal budget which advocates for lowering the national debt the hill mmt is a revival of an early 1900s idea called chartalism now it is influencing the thinking of new socialist like movements in the us and other places and cited by politicians the federal reserve even if a new president could pack the board with members philosophically attuned to a new president s desire to increase public spending through monetary creation does not have the legal authority to directly create money that is a right reserved strictly for the federal government and specifically the us treasury for the federal reserve to create money as mmt advocates want you would have to amend the federal reserve act certainly a possibility but not easy goldcore imagine mmt assumes force of law imagine further that it yields a vast inflation with no corresponding growth is it your belief that congress would raise taxes on the suffering classes in such a season of need the economy would be already at a stall a tax increase would only sink it into recession or worse is not the entire point of mmt to stimulate the economy but assume the tax hikes go through the economy goes upon the skids but the government must keep the printing press whirring to service the expanding deficit that is the presses run reveille to taps seven days of the week a dreadful stagflation is the result bullion vault simply put there is an old economic adage there s no such thing as a free lunch that expression doesn t come with an asterisk next to it that says of course unless you have a printing press and you can print money printing money doesn t give you a free lunch you cannot print wealth schiffgold com doug casey inflation isn t caused by greedy butchers bakers and gasoline makers it s caused by an excess of purchasing media mmt will give the state total control of its quantity and quality if the government increases the money supply by say 10 times general prices will go up by 10 times the value of your dollar savings will drop 90 perhaps most americans won t care because they have no savings just debt bonner partners top imf economist says no free lunch from modern monetary theory the upside down world of mmt mmt and gold the link between inflation and gold is well known and can be historically traced from all the above mentioned analysis it seems clear that despite what mmt s advocates say there is no getting around the fact continual spending without matching taxation must create inflation and inflation is always good for gold another central tenet of mmt is salient here the theory says that a deficit is actually just unspent money suppose the government puts 100 into the economy but only gets back 90 in taxes the result is a 10 deficit mmt argues that deficit is actually asurplus belonging to the economy at large but this argument doesn t hold water because unless a good or service is created from that 10 the 10 er is inflationary it seems extremely unlikely that some kind of debt monetization the likes of mmt could occur but if it did chances are we would have hyperinflation no different than venezuela is currently suffering or post world war one weimar germany even without a sudden shock to the economy like mmt we know that fiat currencies are subject to inflationary pressures and over time lose their value between 1860 and 2015 the dollar experienced 2 6 inflation every year meaning that us 1 in 1860 was equivalent to 27 80 in 2015 this also means that prices in 2015 were 2 828 higher than they were in 1860 when the dollar falls investors flock to gold hence the inverse relationship between the two when the dollar slumped between 1998 and 2008 gold prices nearly tripled reaching 1 000 an ounce in early 2008 and nearly doubling between 2008 and november 2011 when gold hit 1 903 on the risk of the us defaulting on its debt gold is seen as a hedge against inflation because its price generally rises as the cost of living increases as investopedia points out over the past 50 years investors have seen gold prices soar and the stock market plunge during high inflation years imagine what hyperinflation would do to gold the stock market and the us dollar gold investors would see a dramatic spike in the price of bullion as frightened citizens seeing the value of their savings and stocks being eroded flock to a hard asset safe haven read our sprout less gold now tier 1 capital conclusion it s hard to guess what the us federal reserve will do especially during this era of unusual interference by the trump administration but one strains to imagine under what set of circumstances the central bank would adopt something as radical as mmt now we have an economy running at near full employment unemployment just 4 inflation is well within an acceptable range at 2 and the us dollar is holding steady neither sinking nor rising sure we have inequalities and a trade war that isn t doing the economies of china nor the us any favors the us continues to run a trade deficit with china but there is nothing in the us economy that would justify opening up the floodgates to government spending and piling on more debt in any case the next few months look good for gold an interest rate hike appears very unlikely in fact a rate cut appears to be among the options which would be bullish for the precious metal if the fed wants to take it a step further and monetize debt through mmt gold is going to become very expensive indeed by richard rick mills www aheadoftheherd

special envoy to libya ghassan salame to describe this rampant financial corruption in libya and confirm its existence there is a new millionaire every day in libya and the middle class is shrinking day by day salame noted on march 27 the political class he added is shamefully corrupt and fortunes collected from political ranks are being invested abroad politicians in libya seize public money and invest it overseas salame didn t only describe the situation but also threatened in an implicit diplomatic way political figures and others who have been looting libya s money time has come for all parties to stop holding on to a position that will enable them to acquire wealth he said before salame s diplomatic rhetoric former finance minister hassan ziglam warned in february 2012 of this situation the ban on the frozen funds has been lifted he said in a televised interview these funds were brought to libya and smuggled overseas through all land sea and airports he threatened back then to resign and he addressed libyans with much regret to make things clear the total amount of frozen libyan assets smuggled abroad amounted to more than 100 billion these funds were supposed to be primarily allocated to the reconstruction program and contracting with a number of companies as such the funds would go towards the maintenance and rebuilding of schools hospitals universities police headquarters departments and state institutions which were vandalized and destroyed during the revolution in addition to completing some projects especially airports ziglam explained adding that they were however smuggled out through airports seaports and land ports libyan people s money is being smuggled abroad and libyans should demand freezing them again he concluded ziglam s disappointing

past 42 years he said in an appearance on one of the tv channels former minister of health fatima hamroush for her part told irish times newspaper she has documents that prove 1 5 billion have been embezzled out of the country at the international level there is a significant increase in the level of corruption in libya which was ranked 172 among the 177 most corrupt countries said a report issued by transparency international late march 2013 at the local level however head of the libyan audit bureau khalid shakshak affirmed in a voice recording from late 2014 that libya has gone beyond the corruption phase and is now underestimating allocation of public money the budget for 2013 amounted to more than 70 billion yet there was no remarkable improvement in the country sick libyans receive treatments abroad despite the seven billion dollars spent on the health sector and the state is unable to protect its borders and facilities despite spending seven billion dollars on the ministry of defense explained shakshak in humble attempts to reduce corruption and tampering with libyan millions shakshak issued urgent decisions to prevent officials from pursuing their work in certain banks and ordered concerned authorities not to assign them any future leadership work among these officials are the general manager of the republic bank and director of credit risk management department at the same bank he also fired deputy director of the republic bank s branch in al fallah along with director of the north africa bank at zliten s branch shakshak later issued an urgent decision to freeze the bank account s of 38 companies and 62 individuals for being involved in the smuggling of foreign exchange currencies and falsification of official documents the first chapters of smuggling of libyan funds began outside its borders in the early 1980s when the libyan government establishing the libyan arab foreign investment company lafico lafco served as the regime s powerful arm after an economic and air blockade were imposed on it and its funds were frozen following a decision by the security council which accused it of being involved in a number of international terrorist acts other companies and economic entities were established after lafco and became a parallel financial system substituting the central bank of libya this parallel system included billions of dollars invested by libyans in more than 45 countries in europe africa and the rest of the world it put funds in foreign banks either publically or secretly the regime sold oil bought arms invested its money and smuggled it overseas through this virtual system without being exposed because these operations weren t part of the recognized official framework after bitter patience on a nearly 10 year economic siege former muammar gaddafi s regime succeeded in resolving many of the outstanding issues between it and the west the latter of which had imposed an air embargo economic sanctions on the former the west had also frozen libyan funds in foreign banks and stressed a ban on exporting libyan oil in march 2003 the libyan government embarked on real and serious steps to achieve comprehensive economic reforms in the country this started with the appointment of dr shukri mohammed ghanem as prime minister to lead and oversee the implementation of these reforms to some extent he did succeed in said tasks before the end of 2003 the libyan regime fully implemented the west s demands and seemed to be on a path of renewed relations with the international community during that short period of time libya had paid the compensation demanded gave up its nuclear program and promised political and economic reforms previous conditions in libya helped it establish the libyan sovereign investment fund in the same year at a rate of 60 billion dollars with the purpose of moving libya from its bitter reality to a better one sources pointed out that at the beginning of 2010 the libyan government issued more than 20 new laws bringing about comprehensive changes in trade customs income taxes stock exchange labor communications and real estate documentation being politically and economically competent ghanem led the regime s reforms as premier from 2003 to 2005 and as chairman of libya s national oil corporation noc from 2005 to 2011 after the 2011 uprising he fled to italy and then to austria where the police found his corpse floating in the danube river in vienna on april 30 2012 in january 2005 us companies returned to invest in libyan oil after a 20 year ban in may 2006 the us administration announced fully restoring diplomatic relations with libya libya its oil and its openness to the world turned it into an investment haven for many european countries following the lifting of earlier united nations un sanctions in 2003economic activity increased steadily for seven years said a report by the international monetary fund imf early 2012 pointing out that during 2004 10 average real gdp growth was approximately five percent annual consumer price inflation averaged less than four percent and official foreign assets increased from 20 billion at the end of 2003 to 170 billion at the end at 2010 the report added all in all libyans conditions began to change internally and they started dreaming of a different libya this dream would never come into fruition as 2011 arrived and with it came the arab spring revolutions libyans would revolt against the regime and the west would support the revolt which ultimately led to the collapse of gaddafi s rule prior to the 2011 uprising gaddafi denied having a single dollar to his name outside libya which was not true before allowing nato forces to intervene militarily and end gaddafi s rule the security council issued in february 28 2011 resolution 1970 in which article 17 stipulates that all member states shall freeze without delay all funds other financial assets and economic resources which are on their territories which owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the individuals or entities listed in annex ii of this resolution or designated by the committee established pursuant to paragraph 24 below or by individuals or entities acting on their behalf or at their direction or by entities owned or controlled by them and decides further that all in other words any foreign assets belonging to people listed in annex ii should be frozen by the respective member states should any of said assets exist within their jurisdictions the people listed in annex ii included ayesha gaddafi hannibal muammar gaddafi khamis gaddafi muammar gaddafi mutassim gaddafi and saif al islam gaddafi in march 2011 resolution 1973 was issued to affirm all that was stipulated in resolution 1970 adding an article through which assets of gaddafi s sons mohammed and saadi gaddafi shall be frozen in addition to assets belonging to colonel abdullah al senussi abu bakr yunis jabir abu zayd umar dorda and matuq mohammed matuq it also stipulated freezing assets of five libyan institutions and financial entities which are central bank of libya libyan investment authority libyan foreign bank libyan africa investment portfolio and libyan national oil corporation in response to these harsh measures gaddafi told a french journalist in his tent in tripoli on march 5 2011 he doesn t have money abroad and challenged the world to prove the opposite when the regime was overthrown and before gaddafi s death the national transitional council and the executive council governed libya temporarily until democratic elections were held and a new libyan government was formed before holding the elections and forming the awaited government both bodies main concern was restoring libya s frozen funds and assets that were owned by gaddafi both councils were persistent and urgently demanded that the security council release these funds to ensure payment of libyan worker salaries and to activate basic services in the country they requested the release of five billion dinars but the security council released only lyd1 5 billion in exchange for a promise of democratic transition the security council released 15 billion in early september 2011 this amount is small compared to libya s frozen billions that are officially registered to libya s central bank and its investment corporation it should also be noted that the fictitious accounts registered to gaddafi s family and those close to his tent and are still unknown farhat bengdara was the first libyan leader to explain to libyans about the amount and reality of frozen and smuggled funds outside libya being the last governor of its central bank during muammar gaddafi s rule from 2006 to march 12 2011 libyan assets are estimated at 168 425 billion of which about 104 billion are to the central bank these 104 billion are distributed as following about 40 billion in cash about 30 billion as us treasury bonds and bonds in european governments and the rest are distributed on loans given to foreign countries and some investment portfolios managed by others serving the interest of the central bank in addition about 64 billion are given to the libyan investment corporation explained bengdara in an interview with a tv station reuters news agency for its part published on august 31 2011 a detailed report on bengdara s remarks it showed that a number of foreign governments have frozen libyan sovereign funds which is estimated to be at 150 billion and 144 tons of gold as well as 1 2 billion euros deposited in austrian banks and 12 billion pounds in britain of said funds saif al islam gaddafi owns 10 billion alone banks in canada have 2 3 billion worth in libyan funds while those in france have 6 7 billion euros and more than seven billion euros are in germany according to the reuters report the report also added that italy has eight billion dollars while switzerland has 827 million and the united states has about 34 billion worth in frozen funds in its banks after the fall of muammar gaddafi s regime these funds and assets were requested by libya s officials throughout the country s successive governments they tried all possible legal and illegal means to recover these funds and unfreeze them attempts started with the two councils which repeatedly appealed to the security council and requested the release of these funds followed by secret visits to some countries having billions of dollars in frozen in their banks additionally a large number of committees have been established since the transitional council took over all intended to retrieve frozen funds from banks abroad president of the general national congress gnc mohamed al magariaf established one of the more farfetched means for fund recovery he called for the forming of technical committees which would search for these smuggled funds abroad any individual within the committee that recovered the funds would be awarded 10 percent of the retrieved assets for instance if a person within the committee or the entire committee would recover 10 billion dollars worth of funds he or the committee would be rewarded 10 percent of those 10 billion dollars which would equate to a billion dollars the policy was met with some criticism as many observers of libyan affairs considered this decision a means of legalizing corruption by the country s top legislative authority reporting on the libyan assets smuggled into south african provinces is quite complex since there is a lot of conflicting information on the exact amount of funds hidden within libya s continental neighbor however most experts agree that bashir saleh bashir is the key to finding these hidden funds since he owns a large share of the assets after gaddafi s death his secret keeper bashir was arrested but those who wanted the recovery of the funds knew that bashir would only give information if he was freed for this reason he was released from the elysee palace and from there he was meant to head directly to tripoli however after spending two nights at the finest champs elysées hotel he traveled to johannesburg and settled there with his smuggled money he was subjected to an assassination attempt which was thwarted as his death meant the evaporation of libya s billions in south africa bashir was gaddafi s secret keeper and director of his office since the late 1990s he then became head of africa s libyan investment fund until 2011 despite all this speculation the only person who could confirm the true figure of the embezzled funds in south africa was their former president jacob zuma responding to questions by members of his government s parliament about gaddafi s hidden funds zuma told the whole world on july 8 2013 that none of the libyan officials has provided south africa with evidence on the transfer of these assets and funds to south africa those who have evidence should hand them over to the relevant libyan authorities or the united nations we have not found any funds and if any of those libyan funds or assets were found in south africa we will immediately inform the united nations through the department of international relations and cooperation he said zuma s message was over and libya s billions are still buried in his country which is a clear sign that they may not return to the central bank of libya any time soon or ever for that matter the media largely ignored the issue of libyan money in south africa for a while however a recent article in the sunday times revealed that before his death gaddafi smuggled 30 million us dollars to former president jacob zuma s bunker at his home nkandla the funds were discovered recently as the president was moving them out of south africa to estwani jacob zuma had previously denied the existence of embezzled libyan money in south africa but it appears now that the disgraced former president will have another scandal to answer for as much as he tried to hide the assets many in the international community had known about his possession of libyan funds for years for instance the guardian reported that since 2011 former us secretary of state hilary clinton had known about gaddafi and zuma s plans to smuggle the former s funds out of libya clearly the issue of embezzled funds from libya is a complex one that will only be resolved with a coordinated effort from the international community but as it stands the libyan government will have to find ways to improvise the reconstruction process

the orthodox view of trade all nations win as markets spread tranquilly across borders in reality trade can often produce just the opposite fierce market competition and worsening income inequality touted as a great employment generator trade in fact cost a million factory jobs in four industrial u s states where angry voters cast ballots for president donald trump according to a study by david autor of the massachusetts institute of technology and several co authors now his trade war with china threatens to cut off business supply chains and spill into military rivalry in the developing world meanwhile trade has helped many poorer nations tap into world demand for exports but there too it has caused harm even after mexico s lost decade in the 1980s only 2 million mexicans had crossed the u s border by 1990 seeking better lives as undocumented residents but after the 1994 north american free trade agreement nafta the numbers surged by 2000 4 8 million undocumented mexicans despairing of their future at home were in the united states orthodox thinking it seems has a problem on its website the world trade organization wto still has emblazoned the original win win model published by the british economist david ricardo in 1817 if britain uses less labor to make a yard of textiles than to make a gallon of wine and portugal uses less labor to make the wine than the textiles ricardo argued they can each produce the good they make most efficiently trade some of it for the other country s good and obtain more of both protectionist barriers are akin to throwing rocks in one s own harbor the ricardian model captures important insights but its benefits are only fully realized if all its assumptions are met ricardo point blank assumed away today s fear that free trade allows factories to move abroad investors he maintained were generally satisfied with a low rate of profits in their own country rather than seek a more advantageous employment for their wealth in foreign nations he wrote because they feared locating under a strange government and new laws his model as well as modern variants of it also assume that trade is balanced both nations enjoy full employment each nation has a single wage income inequality is literally zero and trade doesn t affect the course of industrial development all wild stretches of course other models have delved into the issues the ricardian model assumes away but none has been so enshrined in contemporary thought in fact ricardo himself cared deeply about two of the issues his model writes off income inequality and industrial development the aristocracy was his particular bugbear the idle rich monopolized agricultural land and drove up the price of wheat the staple food of the working class he argued he fought against laws blocking grain imports in the hopes of reducing food prices easing pressure on workers and still leaving industrialists with higher profits since profits were nearly all invested banking was still rudimentary if they increased ricardo argued they would spur development beyond using it as an example in his model ricardo seems to have thought little about portugal itself but its unhappy situation also highlights development concerns that his schema can t deal with in 1703 the royal navy had sailed into lisbon and forced portugal to sign a now famous treaty to trade its wine for british textiles portugal never exported enough wine to balance this trade the brits it seems were insufficient lushes in real life to finance the textile trade portugal forced slaves to dig gold in brazil and shipped perhaps 50 000 pounds worth every week on packet boats to england demand for britain s textiles overseas key to the early industrial revolution supported its development demand for portuguese gold supported well slaves digging gold and britain was not shy about passing acts requiring its colonies to buy more of its wares a great empire has been established adam smith complained for the sole purpose of raising up a nation of customers who should be obliged to buy from the shops of our different producers u s treasury secretary alexander hamilton having learned from that empire s evident success called for industrial policies a national bank and infrastructure construction and tariffs to shield american industry from foreign competition presidents george washington and john adams implemented some of these policies the slaveholding presidents thomas jefferson and andrew jackson undermined them what need have slaveholders for industry and then ex business lawyer abraham lincoln championed them from the civil war to world war i as the united states advanced from peripheral nation to global power it maintained average tariffs of 40 to 50 percent ha joon chang of cambridge university documents in kicking away the ladder development strategy in historical perspective the smoot hawley tariffs that were levied during the depression the ones economists never tire of lambasting were only a bump up to the higher end of the range essentially all of the countries that we now think of as developed used domestic policies to promote industry and trade protection to shield it chang concludes modern china s approach to export promotion and trade protection is just a free variation on hamilton s policies and britain s before them chinese government banks including the four largest banks in the world lend to support national manufacturing and booming infrastructure investment often via state owned firms china manipulates its currency to make exports cheaper and imports more expensive demands that government agencies at all levels buy local and requires foreign investors to share intellectual property or just outright appropriates it not unlike the united states in the 19th century wall street financier steven rattner has written gung ho chinese growth policies and lax law enforcement have an unsavory wild west flavor another issue ricardo s model assumes away trade s effect on employment did not concern politicians until workers gained voting strength after world war i in a 1937 essay beggar my neighbour remedies for unemployment the cambridge university economist joan robinson presented win lose models showing how a nation can use protectionism to run a trade surplus sustain demand for its goods and create jobs all while pushing deficits and unemployment onto its trading partners modern economists rail against beggar thy neighbor protectionism but rarely acknowledged her point why a nation might use protectionism to support its economy to begin with robinson s concerns loomed large for the negotiators from the 44 allied nations who met in bretton woods in 1944 to negotiate the post world war ii economic order john maynard keynes leader of the british delegation had solicited robinson s ongoing advice in writing his own economic theory harry dexter white the u s leader hewed to keynes ideas as did the overwhelming majority of other delegates but they all understood ricardo too believing that trade war had contributed to the depression and fascism in the 1930s keynes called for a global framework that would manage tensions allow nations to trade peacefully and sustain full employment but he and his contemporaries at bretton woods did not seek to micromanage gazillions of individual trade rules unlike trump today who believes he can use protectionism to decrease the u s trade deficit the fact is that protectionism rarely affects overall trade deficits or surpluses for example throughout the post world war ii decades latin american nations such as mexico brazil and argentina wielded high tariffs often exceeding 50 percent as well as setting fixed quotas on some imports and still often racked up large trade deficits how can a nation with high tariffs run trade deficits tariffs regulate what is imported rather than how much postwar latin american regimes would allow in industrial goods they couldn t produce themselves but block consumer imports a common development strategy overall they still imported as much as they could borrow from abroad to pay for foreign goods the united states did something similar after trump s tax cuts americans had more money in their pocket but u s production couldn t leap to match the demand so goods poured in from abroad the trade deficit swelled to prevent such outcomes when the bretton woods negotiators set out to support trade but avoid large imbalances they focused on financial flows across borders ious nations accumulate in exchange for exports when they run trade surpluses or incur when the run trade deficits the international monetary fund would monitor and control these flows the imf would lend to deficit nations but if they began borrowing too much the fund would require them to cut government expenditures to reduce demand or otherwise slow imports on the flip side if a nation s surplus began to rise the imf would start requiring measures to correct the problem before too long the imf would authorize deficit nations to completely halt exchange of the surplus nation s currency blocking its exports had the imf operated as planned china would have never had a chance to rack up its recent trade surpluses but the imf faced immediate problems after world war ii the administration of president harry truman more economically conservative than the administration of president franklin d roosevelt that had negotiated bretton woods did not want to let any international agency interfere with u s trade surpluses it starved the imf of capital personnel and authority quashing it for a decade when the fund finally stirred back to life in the mid 1950s it set about imposing harsh conditions on deficit nations in exchange for bridge loans it hardly touched surplus nations by the 1960s as some u s sectors went into trade deficit imf managing director pierre paul schweitzer u s representatives to a fund meeting in 1967 in rio de janeiro and other officials pushed to revive something like the original bretton woods system but france believing it would abet u s hegemony opposed the idea and japan and germany having emerged as major surplus nations dragged their feet germany now learned to measure economic success not by domestic well being the economist adam tooze has lamented but by the scale of its trade surplus though it escapes notice germany often runs surpluses in goods and services larger than china s indeed the financial ious southern european nations signed over to german banks to cover their trade deficits set up the euro crisis all along politicians never really seemed to believe ricardo even u s president bill clinton the consummate globalist promoted nafta by promising that it would create a million jobs in the first five years and well paid jobs at that not only did they not materialize the ricardian model does not even promise them but just assumes full employment from the start as the touchstone of trade orthodoxy a position the pragmatic ricardo himself would hardly have given it the ricardian model itself causes harm by shoving the very idea of trade tensions under the table it undermines coherent discussion of how to handle them at best the result is endless squabbling about dirty exceptions to an imagined world of perfect markets at worst the result is trade war sometimes spilling into real war a contemporary revision of the imf to handle trade tensions might be technically possible it would first focus on correcting large currency undervaluations or overvaluations causing sustained surpluses or deficits but nations won t agree to it any time soon in its absence they will keep squabbling over trade at best erupting in trade wars at worst global markets spreading unregulated across national polities will let capital apply pressure by seeking out cheaper locations to operate nafta helped mexico attract investment for a few years but soon saw much of it flee for lower wage china threatening an equitable income distribution and on and off undermining full employment
as prepared for delivery a dynamic and inclusive global economy is central to achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs it is critical to address not only short term risks financial stress and volatility high debt levels escalating trade disputes and geopolitical tensions but also longer term sustainable development challenges including tackling inequalities and climate change we still have a global financial and economic system that is not responding to the needs for the scale and type of finance that is required for sustainable development decisive policy action is needed to mobilize sufficient finance including climate finance and to align incentives with the imperative of advancing sustainable development including by enabling a shift towards longer term investment horizons in order to give visibility to these challenges and the collective action required to address them the united nations will seize the opportunity of a series of high level events in september including the sdg summit the high level dialogue on finance as well as the climate action summit and looks forward to collaborating with the imf global economic growth prospect according to the united nations world economic situation and prospects 2019 global economic growth is expected to remain steady at 3 percent in 2019 and 2020 after expanding at 3 1 percent in 2018 whereas economic growth accelerated in more than half the world s economies in 2017 18 it has been uneven across regions and countries economic activity continues to expand rapidly in most parts of east and south asia while in africa latin america and the caribbean and western asia home to half of the people living in extreme poverty per capita gdp growth is on average significantly below 1 5 percent while a modest recovery is projected in 2019 per capita incomes are still likely to remain stagnant or grow only marginally impeding efforts to advance sustainable development in particular in the majority of least developed countries ldcs per capita gdp growth is significantly below levels needed to eradicate extreme poverty there are also increasing signs that global growth may have peaked since the beginning of 2018 the growth in global industrial production and merchandise trade volumes has been slowing growth forecasts have been revised downward due in part to the negative effects of trade uncertainty and weakening financial market sentiment at the same time policy uncertainty persists on multiple fronts downside risks to growth forecasts remain high and surveys show an overall weakening in business and consumer confidence increased risks and vulnerabilities increasing downside risks and vulnerabilities threaten the sustainability of economic growth and the achievement of the sdgs public debt has risen in many countries some middle income countries are experiencing debt levels last seen during the debt crises of the 1980s 40 percent of ldcs and other low income countries are either in or at high risk of debt distress debt vulnerabilities in developing countries exist not only because of higher levels of debt but also increased risks from a shift in debt composition including variable interest rates and greater reliance on commercial debt a more prominent role of non traditional creditors and market based financing also presents new challenges for debt crisis resolution the rise in public debt has been accompanied by an increase in corporate debt particularly in middle income countries further increases in global interest rates could create concerns for financial stability and in many cases for public debt sustainability as private liabilities often become public during crises while debt levels in the majority of developing countries remain sustainable the rise in the number of countries in or at high risk of debt distress demands the attention of global policy makers developing countries as a group have become more exposed to global finance while this has provided much needed access to finance it has also left them more vulnerable and susceptible to contagion the protracted period of abundant global liquidity and low interest rates in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis has fueled a potential build up of financial fragilities across both the developed and developing economies despite the financial market corrections seen in 2018 and early 2019 high risk behaviour remains a concern in global financial markets heightened trade tensions also pose a significant risk to the global growth outlook through several channels including a slowdown in investment higher consumer prices and a decline in business confidence as fiscal and monetary policy space has narrowed considerably across the world any crisis or external shock could have severe and long lasting implications for growth and socioeconomic conditions countries with large macroeconomic imbalances and high levels of external debt are particularly vulnerable opportunities for financing sustainable development mobilizing sufficient financing remains a major challenge in implementing the 2030 agenda for sustainable development investments that are critical to achieving the sdgs remain

revisiting national and global approaches to sustainable finance five key messages emerge from our joint analysis first the multilateral system is under strain in a rapidly changing global environment this is forcing the global community to revisit existing multilateral arrangements as we address the challenges we open the door to making multilateral institutions fit for purpose for sustainable development for example the crisis of the multilateral trading system is also an opportunity to revamp and make it fit for purpose for sustainable development challenges in sovereign debt restructuring in part due to new instruments and non traditional creditors have sensitized the international community to gaps in the existing architecture increasing vulnerabilities have underscored the importance of strengthening the global financial safety net the digitalisation of the economy has fuelled the debate about the design of the international tax system that could help address inequities growing market concentration including in the digital economy has underscored the need to better monitor this trend and manage its socio economic implications second and in response rather than retreating from multilateralism the international community must strengthen collective action to address global challenges third global approaches need to be complemented by national actions member states can operationalize integrated national financing frameworks to support national development strategies these frameworks should respond to the realities of a changing global landscape for example digitalization and falling wage share fourth achieving sustainable development and combatting climate change requires a long term perspective yet both public and private incentives are short term oriented fifth we must harness the potential of financial innovations to strengthen development finance however as such innovations do not eliminate financial and sustainability risks policymakers and regulators need to strike a balance between managing emerging risks and enabling experimentation and innovation this is why policy and regulation is a key focus area for the work of the un secretary general s task force on digital financing the task force which brings together policymakers regulators entrepreneurs and other experts is exploring how to harness the power of new financial technologies for the achievement of the sdgs importance of tackling inequalities despite the enormous potential of globalization and technological progress far too many people have not shared the gains and are being left behind income inequality has increased in about half of the countries around the world over the last three decades wealth is also becoming more concentrated meanwhile global growth in real wages is only 1 8 per cent the lowest since 2008 inequalities are prevalent in access to quality education health and technologies as well as vulnerability to shocks among other areas we also see persistent gender disparities across the world inequality limits people s choices and opportunities and engenders political and social tensions and global inefficiencies this year undp s flagship human development report will focus on the critical issue of inequality in human development the imperative of reducing inequalities is enshrined in the 2030 agenda and its central pledge of leaving no one behind achieving the sdgs for all requires a systems approach to sustainable development and coalitions of actors that co create and jointly apply integrated solutions tackling inequality requires partnership governments the private sector and civil society working together national policies will need to address the falling wage share and growing vulnerabilities these policies include designing the right labour market reforms as well as investments in human capital and social protection systems while many policies can be implemented at the national level e g fiscal policies or regulatory frameworks others require international efforts such as in tax cooperation and monitoring trends in market concentration in our pledge to leave no one behind sdg 16 highlights the importance of strengthening institutions and governance with the imf s new framework for enhanced engagement on governance we see stronger synergies for partnerships at the global regional and country levels the four elements of the imf s framework link strongly with the un system s work in the fight against corruption fighting corruption requires concrete actions through a concerted effort of all sections of society in this regard the un system would like to highlight the importance of further strengthening of collaboration with the imf to accelerate the anti corruption agenda globally the urgency of climate action the urgency of climate action cannot be overemphasized we have a rapidly shrinking window of time to accelerate action or we risk our planet into catastrophic consequences we need to cut emissions in half by 2030 and reach zero emissions by 2050 while significantly increasing adaptation and strengthening resilience to the already changing climate the paris agreement put the world on a pathway for ambitious collective action nationally determined contributions ndcs are an unprecedented opportunity to transform our development pathways at an unparalleled scale and pace across all societies it requires scaling up usage of a wide range of innovative technologies massive shift in behavioral change and importantly in investment patterns across all sectors between now and 2050 achieving ndcs and financing the global transition to a low carbon and climate resilient economy will require an investment of at least us 60 trillion it is clear that public finance is not sufficient and must be used strategically to mobilise increased volumes of private finance the leadership of finance ministers is critical to guide fiscal policy decisions and investments into the right trajectory this includes fostering an enabling environment to unlock much needed private capital at scale and a people centred approach to support just transition and equitable share from the proceeds of green growth climate action it is encouraging to see increasing leadership on this particularly for developing countries the role of development finance institutions in support of this effort is also essential especially in contributing to provide stable and predictable climate finance flows to developing countries it is key to ensure that support to access blend and catalyse finance while also ensuring that the modalities selected to deliver this finance are in line with existing development effectiveness principles and do not divert funds away from the countries and societies most in need going forward we need to continue to place high priority on policy packages that support the implementation of ambitious ndcs such as carbon pricing reform of energy subsidies mandatory disclosure of climate related financial risks accelerated investment in sustainable infrastructure and supply chain transparency these policy packages must consider poverty reduction as well as gender equality and social inclusion as key criteria at the united nations we are committed to work closely with the bretton woods institutions to strengthen our support to ministries of finance to create enabling environment for investment mainstream climate action across relevant national financial planning and integrate market based instruments to sustainably scale up private sector investment we firmly support the new coalition of finance ministers for climate action and the helsinki principles launched this week this important initiative demonstrates a stronger commitment and leadership of finance ministers to address climate challenges in particular in mobilizing a whole of government approach to raise ambitions and accelerate the implementations of the national climate targets defined in the ndcs to support efforts to implement the paris agreement and to increase ambition and climate action the united nations secretary general will bring world leaders from government finance business and civil society to the climate action summit on 23 september 2019 the summit will be a critical opportunity to accelerate climate action and raise ambitions to meet the ultimate goal of the paris agreement to keep the global temperature below 1 5 degrees celsius united nations collaboration with the imf the un appreciates its continuing

at the same time mainland china is facing further economic slowdown amid trade tensions with the us while japan is struggling to support domestic inflation and consumer demand despite the ultra accommodative monetary policies the uk russia and the us have posted moderate expansion over the past year despite the mounting economic gloom but those economies are facing downside factors as well amid the heightened speculation of a global recession the us federal reserve took a more dovish stance on policy saying it would likely abstain from raising rates this year however the fed has the room to cut rates in case of a downturn as after its modest tightening cycle of 2015 2018 us base borrowing costs stand at 2 5 percent read more sounding the alarm us 2018 gdp report highlights trend in economic slowdown while the same applies to the bank of england boe and the russian central bank as another example other major regulators such as the ecb and the bank of japan boj would have to go deeper into the negative rates territory which is seen as quite a risky strategy market pricing is expressing more anxiety that the ecb is either too slow to use whatever is left in its policy toolbox or worse that it thinks the tools won t do much anyway laurence mutkin of the french bank bnp paribas said

throughout the years equity research has always had the defining feature of the price target that has more recently been morphed into a target range which gave the authors of the research more room for variation and a smaller probability of being incorrect everyone who has made incorrect price target calls will tell you that it is difficult to do given that the time frames that they chose were insufficient to have their thesis play out and their price target reached in crypto i think it gets even a bit more complex in 2018 alone there were all sorts of price target predictions that were supposed to play out by year s end just about all of these predictions ended up being incorrect often by a very wide margin given that the year ended at 3 750 usd btc these price predictions were often made on very public media channels by leaders in the crypto markets for whom i have tremendous respect and admiration for when confronted in 2019 some of the people explained why they believed that their predictions did not play out and adjusted their targets and time tables while others said that bitcoin price is difficult to predict for a myriad of reasons and vowed to not make further price predictions in my decade of experience in the markets i have yet to make a public price prediction on anything but i think that this would be a great time for a first go at it although i am not intending to say that i expect bitcoin to be worth x usd by date y i plan for this to be a series of articles that touch on several macro themes that i believe have a good probability of occurrence during the next 2 4 years in this series i will provide a range of bitcoin prices that i think are reasonable to expect if said macro theme occurs in isolation the series will mostly focus on several assumptions that are related to bitcoin specifically as a store of value after these assumptions are made clear i will show how potential macro events will trigger cash inflows into bitcoin which will result in a subsequent expansion of the market capitalization through a resulting demand for bitcoin which will ultimately affect its price a primary assumption here is that 2 of the cash flows during a devaluation that would normally flow to gold will move from risk assets to bitcoin instead this will be because as investors gain confidence that bitcoin is a secure less volatile and more accepted throughout the institutional investment space it will make more sense to diversify from precious metals as the only safe haven assets second in order to make a meaningful impact on the price of bitcoin institutional investors only have to make a very small percentage of the total amount that they diversify away from precious metals into bitcoin as the total market capitalization of bitcoin 91 6bn usd as of this writing is miniscule in comparison to the flows that will result as a consequence of adverse macro moves that will be triggered by the events that i will describe below in this article we will look at what would happen if a country within the eurozone would experience a debt crisis if we look at recent history of macro tremors in the eurozone that were caused by geopolitical events combined with high sovereign debt loads the most prevalent was the greek debt crisis in 2009 and 2010 while most people remember the riots the imf and eu bailouts and the very public desire of greek citizens to leave the eu and go back to the drachma let us take a step back and look at the dynamics of being a nation within the eu that uses the euro as the primary currency the events that happened during this timeframe and also the price action of the eur usd pair as well as the price of gold denominated in usd the dichotomy of being a sovereign nation that is part of a greater alliance that shares a currency with the other member nations has incentives that are very misaligned between net saver nations and those of net debtor nations a basic way to think about it is that when one nation s debt grows as a percentage of its gdp to a level that is unsustainable the government of that nation is unable to print more money and therefore the burden of that debt directly and indirectly falls on the other nations of the alliance particularly on those nations who are net savers this not only creates an international intra alliance fiscal imbalance but also social issues in which citizens of saver countries develop hostile feelings toward the citizens of indebted countries as a heavy debt load typically depicts a situation where a country is fiscally irresponsible due to spending above their means and not managing their affairs in an efficient manner on a fundamental level why would a german citizen see his euro savings be diluted because greece needs a bailout one of the root causes of the greek debt crisis can be attributed to the global financial crisis spurned by the collapse of the mortgage market in the united states as borrowing costs skyrocketed and financing dried up greece got to a point where it was no longer able to meet payments on its debt the chart below shows how the greek debt to gdp ratio was much higher than that of its eu counterparts eurostat ec euroa eu eurostat on october 4 2009 george papandreou of the greek socialist party becomes the greek prime minister shortly after the papandreou government reveals that the greek budget deficit will exceed 12 a figure that is later revised to 15 4 the economist this causes credit rating agencies to downgrade the greek sovereign debt ratings to junk status in early 2010 looking at the usd eur pair the october 1 2009 level of 1 4537 usd eur compared with the june 1 2010 rate of 1 2214 usd eur during the events described earlier was a 16 0 eur depreciation if we compare the dollar price of gold during the same period we saw a 22 2 price appreciation from 1 004 8 usd to 1 227 8 usd based on this rotation into gold during a period of severe stress on the euro i will attempt to extrapolate how a similar rotation during the next euro crisis will affect bitcoin given the assumption that 2 of the total rotation to gold will instead go into bitcoin the euro started rebounding in may of 2010 after the imf and the eu agreed to provide 110 billion eur in loans in exchange for commitments of austerity and tax increases in addition the ecb launched the securities market program www ecb europa eu which allowed the central bank to purchase government bonds of struggling countries on the secondary market although there are many estimates some of which vary as much as 20 the world gold council estimates that all the gold ever mined totals 187 200 metric tons as of 2017 taking today s price of 1 291 5 usd per troy ounce the total value of all gold is 7 77 trillion usd to keep this exercise on the conservative side we will not take into account proven but not yet extracted gold looking at the chart below although greece is still the runaway champion here italy is not too far behind with 132 1 and france and spain hovering just below the 1 1 mark as we recall from the eurostat chart earlier in this paper greece hit 130 right around the beginning of 2009 which made it very fragile to any broader macro shocks i think that it is also interesting to note that the maastricht treaty which led to the creation of the euro provides guidance that no eurozone member nation limit their debt to 60 of gdp and annual deficits no greater than 3 of gdp rules that are more or less ignored by member nations france is projected to have a budget deficit of 3 4 in 2019 reuters tradingeconomics com if we assume that there is a debt crisis in italy spain or france it can be expected to produce a 16 slide in the euro just like during the greek crisis back in 2009 2010 again sticking to the conservatism principle we will not adjust for the fact that the 2018 usd measures of gdp of france italy and spain 2 79tn 2 09tn and 1 44tn respectively dwarf the greek 0 25tn usd gdp the bigger economies would theoretically cause a much larger depreciation in the eur considering that all else would remain the same however given a different monetary policy environment the fact that it would be bold to assume that the eur usd pair would fall by 50 as well as other macro based reasoning it is difficult to say how much the currency would depreciate with any precision so we will stick with mirroring the 16 drop during the greek crisis which we also assume will yield the same 22 upward response from the price of gold given the above assumptions a 22 increase in the price of gold given a 7 77tn usd market cap at current prices would imply that 1 72tn usd inflow into gold if 2 of money out of the total rotation into gold would instead be allocated to bitcoin since these assumptions are difficult to get with certain degree of accuracy i thought that a good way to look at this would be through a sensitivity table that takes a range of gold price appreciation against a range of the of money inflow intended for gold that would instead come to bitcoin the base case of 22 price appreciation in gold with 2 of gold inflows instead going to bitcoin shows that a price of 7 138 usd per bitcoin a 38 increase from current april 7 2019 pricing in the next paper in this series we will look at the corporate debt bubble that i believe is developing in the debt and leveraged loan markets and what btc price appreciation we can derive from a bearish event in that space
middle east and central asia department speakers jihad azour director middle east and central asia department wafa amr senior communications officer communications department ms amr welcome to the press briefing on the middle east and central asia economic outlook i d like to introduce jihad azour director of the middle east and central asia department he will make a few opening remarks and then we will take your questions i d also like to invite journalists online to start sending their questions thank you mr azour thank you wafa good morning everyone let me start by welcoming you all to the imf s 2019 spring meetings the forecasts for our region were included in the world economic outlook for countries in the middle east north africa afghanistan and pakistan region and the caucasus and central asia the main takeaway is this global economic headwinds are making policy efforts more urgent and more challenging let me begin by focusing on the menap region where slowing global growth and trade as well as geopolitical tensions and other potential external shocks will pose economic challenges these trends heighten the urgency of implementing reforms that bolster economic resilience and secure inclusive growth in the region s oil exporters economic growth is projected to remain subdued this year at 0 4 percent a modest decline from 2018 s 0 6 percent that s largely driven by a sharp contraction in economic activity in iran following the renewal of sanctions in gcc countries growth is expected to remain mostly unchanged going from 2 percent in 2018 to a projected 2 1 percent this year for oil exporting countries lower and more volatile oil prices are also weighing on fiscal and external balances with a stalled near term recovery countries should pursue deeper reforms to spur inclusive growth this includes resuming growth friendly fiscal consolidation efforts which slowed last year following the surge in oil prices at the same time countries should work to achieve sustainable spending levels that would help insulate their economies from oil price swings further efforts are also needed to develop small and medium sized enterprises a critical source of jobs for a region where unemployment remains far too high finally social spending and measures to protect the poor remain urgent needs for oil importers growth is expected to slow from 4 2 percent in 2018 to a projected 3 6 percent this year a result in part of the weaker global economic environment there is variation across countries however with egypt s growth expected to continue its rise and pakistan s economy projected to slow significantly and weigh on the region s aggregate growth rate overall growth remains insufficient to reduce unemployment especially among young people in many oil importing countries rising debt levels are becoming a more urgent challenge for their macroeconomic stability high debt is also limiting fiscal space for critical investments in health education infrastructure and social programs these budget pressures underscore the urgency of lifting medium term growth with structural reforms such as measures to improve the business environment and governance enhance labor market flexibility and strengthen market competition turning to the cca growth in the region has stabilized since the shocks of 2014 16 in large part a result of strengthened policy frameworks such as reforms to the tax code in countries like armenia georgia and uzbekistan and greater exchange rate flexibility we project growth to be 4 1 percent in 2019 and 2020 little changed from 4 2 percent growth in 2018 and generally in line with our october projections however growth remains well below its long run potential and too low to meaningfully raise living standards this is a concern particularly in view of a number of risks to the regional outlook including lower growth among key trading partners and oil price swings a top policy priority is the need to address banking system issues including for many countries the prevalence of problem assets while some reforms have been undertaken further action is needed to improve financial soundness and to ensure that banks lending abilities are not inhibited additional structural reforms are also needed to complete transitions to fully credible monetary policy frameworks promote private sector development and diversification and improve governance before we move to questions let me state that the imf remains committed to helping countries in both regions in their reform programs currently there are nine ongoing lending arrangements with countries in the two regions with our arrangement with egypt the largest a staff level agreement was also recently reached with armenia that will aim to support their economic program to achieve inclusive growth capacity development and technical assistance are also critical imf priorities somalia for instance is one of the largest beneficiaries of fund provided ta we look forward to continued engagement in the years ahead with countries throughout both regions we ll have detailed presentations on the menap region at a launch in dubai on april 29 on that same day we ll launch our outlook for the caucasus and central asia region we are also pleased that our managing director christine lagarde will be visiting the cca region in may with that i d like to field your questions ms amr thank you jihad we will take your questions now please identify yourself and the media organization you work for please the mic questioner i have two questions for mr jihad we have an economic reform program that is being finalized in egypt how do you assess the macroeconomic indicators for egypt when it comes to inflation the restructuring of subsidies and exchange rate of the guinea and if the slowdown is only temporary or if it will continue i mean you do support stable exchange rate on the long range and second the last part of the program when will it be disbursed mr azour well in the first part of your question the economic indicators for the egyptian economy these indicators improved the larger in the last two years the program that was set by the government was supported by the imf and it contributed in improving the economic stability in egypt for example growth increased to 5 5 percent in the last two years and we expect it to remain as is while inflation after reaching more than 30 percent in 2007 is lower at nearly 14 percent also unemployment moved from 12 percent to 9 percent and other economic indicators like the improved exports and tourism have been improving as well so first we have reached in first phase of economic stability which is of essence for the structural reforms we need to allow for growth to create jobs for the new youth who enter the work markets 700 000 to 1 million every year this will allow for the economy to adapt with international changes and to provide a bigger role to the private sector and this also will allow to improve the level of social protection which was an important part of the first program now moving to inflation as i said it s been improving as for the measures concerning subsidies subsidies now are being targeted for specific social classes as for the exchange rate the market sets the exchange rate and we follow on the development of the exchange rate as for the last phase of the program as you know the program is about to be completed we still have one last review which should be in june we had another review that was published in the report and in the report we have the main access about the last phase and we had meetings with officials in egypt from the government and central bank and they said they are committed to the reforms and we expect also to have detailed discussions by the missions in june and the program as you know ends in november and the imf as always is willing to cooperate with the government at any level mr azour the mission will be in egypt in the next few weeks in order to complete the review successfully but it s too early to talk about it we will wait for the mission to be in egypt and then we will see how the work is moving forward the program so far was very well implemented and we do hope that the discussions and the review will keep going on as they did previously questioner my first question is what are the points which are still pending in the discussions between the imf and tunisia my second question when do you think that you will conclude an agreement and what would be the dates when the last tranche would be set mr azour thank you for your question as you know the imf has supported tunisia for several years with the extended fund facility arrangement a mission went to tunis last week and it met with authorities from the finance ministry and the central bank and discussions are ongoing in order to look into the details of all the issues which have been discussed during the last review as you know the purpose of the program at present is to achieve three goals first of all stability in order to build confidence and this is very important for the tunisian economy which is beginning to see some modest but important recovery so the first goal is stability in order to build confidence the second goal is to make it possible through the program to have the utmost support for tunisia and the tunisian economy and it is important to ensure in terms of monetary policy and also budgetary policy and in particular the deficit levels in the budget the impact of monetary policy on capacity and inflation those are technical points which are important and the third goal is to see how the support for the more vulnerable social groups can be assured by redistributing the limited budgetary resources and thus the importance of the reform of the subsidies and during this press conference discussions are ongoing between the imf and the authorities and in the next few days we ll be able to clarify issues further so these are still in growth or well i don t want to go into more technical details which are still under discussion generally speaking when there is a negotiation ongoing at the end until the end of the negotiations we don t go into those detailed discussions our teams are working to resolve the last issues as for the tranche our goal is to make as much progress as possible we are very aware of the importance of economic and social stability in tunisia the fund has always been committed to tunisia in all of its transition periods and will remain so thank you questioner i would like to know what are your focus regarding economic growth in morocco for 2019 since the central bank s initial projects were revised downwards so what is your overall assessment of morocco s economy since it s heavily agriculture based and my second question concerns the exchange rate and making the exchange rate flexible the dirham rate flexible and do you think that they should move to the second stage and make the fluctuation range broader mr azour thank you for your question for 2019 for morocco the growth is at 3 2 percent that s the projection agriculture is an important sector and so climate developments have an impact on growth if we look in detail economic growth outside of agriculture is higher than overall growth morocco in recent years has managed to carry out some significant reforms reforms aimed at stabilizing its economy and improving the macroeconomic framework and this is very important for both growth and investment and for making it possible for the country to invest in the future in education and in social sectors so several reforms have been successful and the fund has been one of morocco s very strong partners a program a new program was recently signed as you may know and there we have been emphasizing reforms to help the country make progress in the business climate in stability and that brings me to my second point the private sector also succeeded in transforming itself to cover new markets such as in africa and to engage in investments that are high value added and so morocco is more exposed to commerce and the global economy and therefore needs to create a more strategic situation in a stable economy with regard to your second question morocco has succeeded in putting in place a flexible exchange rate but managing a flexible exchange rate requires having a stable economy as well as a macroeconomic policy that strengthens investor confidence by reducing inflation and by reducing into internal and external inequalities and inaudible and by boosting growth in the economy and we believe morocco is moving in that direction use the mic questioner my second question on the broadening of the fluctuation band is morocco ready to go to the second stage mr azour well there s not one stage or another its market forces that in fact determine the current exchange rates because the exchange rate has become flexible and so it s the macroeconomic situation that determines what happens so this change to a new exchange rate regime was done under good conditions and it s not our role to determine whether the exchange is adequate or not questioner jordan has introduced a lot of financial reforms at the last year do you think this is a financial reform is enough for jordan to improve growth and do you think jordan needs to extend its program with the imf at my last question is there any new reviews for jordan for the economic performance mr azour thank you let me first remind you that the imf is committed to supporting jordan and the jordanian economy which is facing a set of challenges party due to the economic and political developments and new political external factors the imf on several occasions contributed to supporting jordan by supporting reform programs undertaken by the government the last contribution was the fact that mme lagarde attended a conference in london where the imf participated significantly in urging the donor countries to provide the maximum magnitude of aid in support of jordan the weakening of the economic growth in jordan requires a number of structural reforms that would strengthen inclusive growth and create jobs jordan suffers from an 18 percent unemployment mostly among the youth for this reason one of the goals of the program is to accelerate the structural reforms in sectors such as energy tax reforms so that there is a wider participation by all segments of the society particularly the high income sectors and to reduce the costs of energy and labor to accelerate employment because of the growing debt in jordan it is important to maintain financial stability this requires prudent financial and fiscal policies to reduce deficit this is the main key to allow jordan to maintain stability and attract additional investments at present there are positive external developments such as open trade with iraq and the growing volume of trade with iraq also reactivating the gas deal with egypt all these are additional factors it is important to maintain a set of reforms as regards the second review the review is underway and part of it is on two tracks the reforms and the subsidies along these two tracks discussion is underway this week actually with the jordanian authorities towards that end as regards the future stage we are in a review mode as the imf stated before the imf is willing to support jordan because of the social economic challenges and if jordan requests additional support we are ready to help in addition to the financial support the imf for jordan and other countries provides important support through technical assistance and training provided by an institute in kuwait and technical assistance center in beirut questioner so in armenia where was a revolution last year declared fight against corruption so what s your evaluation of armenian government s actions new government s actions and what would be your advice to them maybe and what are your expectations for armenia this year and do you plan to extend the cooperation with armenia thank you ms amr thank you very much the fund has reached a staff level agreement with the armenian s authorities on a new program and the objective of this new program is to raise the level of growth as well as also to tackle issues of inclusion and it s based on certain number of structural reforms that big part of those reforms are in fact to expand the role of the private sector by improving the investment environment and during our meetings with the authorities we were told that they are preparing five year strategy in this direction there is another pillar of reform which is reforming the tax system in order to make it more transparent and also conducive for investment and this is goes in the right direction the imf provided technical assistance in the design of this reform that is important pillar both for the adjustment and stability at the fiscal level as well as also to improve growth potential for armenia of course armenia is very much attached to the fiscal rule and the fiscal rule is anchoring the debt dynamic and this is something that will help armenia by reducing the level of debt increase its macroeconomic stability and hence increase capital flows that will go into the private sector of course armenia like any other country in this part of the world is also affected by the regional and international development and it s very important for armenia to keep on the reform journey increase governance address some of the bottlenecks and the cost of doing business maintain strong macroeconomic stability and we expect growth for armenia this year to be at 4 6 percent 4 5 for 2020 which is i would say slightly lower than in 2018 but i think it s still fairly good level questioner i have a question regarding the in the last review for the imf they said that egypt needs more taxation reforms to complete the program and it is committed to the program already so in your opinion what are new taxes needed some like capital taxes other taxes to promote the economy achieve growth and to achieve also social protection thank you mr azour thank you very much this next review will not have any request or issues related to taxation in it the main objective of this review is to strengthen some of the structural reforms that will help the economy to grow faster and to be led by the private sector for example the key reform area as in fact it was published in the last review document will be on how to improve business environment passing the law on public procurement in order to allow additional transparency on the process of procurement and attract additional fdi s and also the land reform that the government is committed to in addition to a certain number of other structural reforms like finishing the well started job on subsidy reform therefore for the next review it is going to be more on those issues as well as also anchoring the macrocosmic stability with the next budget with an objective of achieving a level of primary surplus the balance between government revenues and government expenditure outside the debt servers to a surplus of two percent which will help egypt achieve in the medium term a debt trend that will help lower the debt which is one of the main objectives of the program therefore those are in fact the key issues that or the key pillars of the last review of the program as i said they are more targeted toward growth attracting by improving certain number of legislations fdi addressing some of the issues related to social protection and maintain the consistent trend since the last two years in terms of deficit and debt on downward dynamic questioner when will the egyptian people feel the benefits of the program with the imf second question about madame lagarde s statement yesterday that egypt in terms of entrepreneurship and supporting the private sector needs to work more given that the state is intervening in certain sectors thank you mr azour thank you this was an important question the reform track is a long track the first phase is to let the egyptians feel stability the aim of the first program or the first phase of the pogrom was to reduce the economic risks particularly in terms of the imbalance in the fiscal and external balances which impacted egypt s trade significantly and this was achieved the second is the financial stability with the growth in reserves which allow the egyptian economy to attract billions of investment though the part of the investments went into fiscal or securities but we have seen direct investment rise and we hope the rise in direct investment will further enhance the ability to create jobs we have seen in the past two years also a decrease in unemployment of course the ambitions are greater but from 12 percent to 9 percent at a time when the region is seeing a rise in unemployment this is a good sign to get into more details we want to separate among the sectors the vulnerable sectors benefitted from that takafol and karameh program which made up for some of the negative impacts of reforms there were also other programs that provided subsidies in my last meeting with a group of officials in february in egypt i noticed how much these programs provided more protection particularly for the women in rural areas 70 percent of the beneficiaries were women who had no skills were illiterate these programs provided a minimum level of dignity for the people continuing these programs is important and the people will feel that reforming part of the subsidy regime is now paying off the second part that needs to be focused on is the middle class the private sector is the main engine of growth now because of its dynamism and because the public sector cannot handle greater numbers and because of the dynamism of the egyptian youth which also during my visit to egypt it was opportunity for me to interact with egyptian youth there is huge potential in the youth very promising so strengthening investment in the economic infrastructure digital economy education enhancing the role of the private sector and the market giving a greater sense that stability in the economy will continue into the next phase this is very important also giving a greater space and flexibility to the fiscal policy meaning allowing more money from the budget to be used in offering more social protection this is key these are the one this is one of the pillars of the programs that the imf supported with egypt questioner i would like to ask you about statements by madame lagarde during the press conference when she said that there will be assistance to egypt after the end of the program in the field of entrepreneurship how are you going to assist egypt in this regard this is a very important topic the second question is what is your assessment about the level of debt in egypt public debt particularly after the shift in numbers lately and what are your expectations of the final review thank you very much mr azour thank you for the first question which is very important one of the main issues that we work on in the region is how to support medium and small enterprises in the economy we identified the importance of funding and financing medium and startups enterprises and startups because egypt is important we launched the report in egypt madame lagarde stressed the importance of this issue there will be a meeting in less than 15 minutes with governors of the central bank on this particular issue there will be a study to be published at the end of the month at the meeting of the arab finance ministers in kuwait on this issue there will be also another meeting in september with governors of the central bank and arab financial institutions on this vital and key and important topic that the imf is working on as you know the imf does not provide project loans but macroeconomic loans but we are ready to support this endeavor the second question is also important about public debt the importance of the drop in public debt is that it allows the economy to grow and to remove some of the burdens on the public sector the purpose of the last or final review is to make sure there is an initial surplus in the budget to reduce the debt gradually raising growth is important in 2019 we expect the growth in egypt to be 5 1 percent and we hope this level of growth will continue and even reach 6 percent this is very important through the imf program public debt in egypt has dropped from 103 percent in 2016 17 to 86 percent of gdp in 2018 19 fiscal year it is projected to decline further to 80 percent in 2020 because of this working on continuing the prudent financial management to reduce debt is extremely important for the egyptian economy i expect the final review to be concluded in june in cairo ms amr thank you jihad thank you everybody this ends the press conference on the middle east and central asia
ruth sunderland fears for return of italian debt doom mount amid international monetary fund comments has the eurozone crisis of 2012 ever really gone away in its global financial stability report the international monetary fund this week gave voice to concerns about the situation in italy where there are new fears of a debt doom loop the populist coalition in rome an unlikely pairing of the anti establishment five star movement and the right wing league came into confrontation with the european commission last year over its urge to escape the straitjacket brussels imposed on spending the fracas pushed up the yield on italian sovereign bonds which is jargon for saying investors lost faith in the country s financial stability in a big way the italian government backed off and investors calmed down somewhat but the fear remains a report from the oecd earlier this month found the italian economy has stagnated since 2000 the country is carrying a huge burden of debt 2 4 trillion or around 138 per cent of national output unemployment is running at a rate of nearly 11 per cent and shockingly at just under 33 per cent for under 25s there is unsurprisingly an exodus of young italians seeking their fortune elsewhere the situation has not improved since then in its world economic outlook the imf forecasts growth of just 0 1 per cent this year and 0 9 per cent in 2020 the human costs will continue to mount the concern at the imf is that the situation in italy has rekindled worries about the sovereign financial sector nexus in plain terms they are scared there might be a crisis in italian state bonds that will spill over into its banking system and from there into the wider economy and perhaps to other countries the idea of a sovereign debt doom loop is a frightening one the country s banks are not in great shape and they are holding around 360bn of italian government bonds the contagion would also threaten the insurance sector after the 2012 eurozone sovereign debt crisis the european regulators forced banks to hold more capital and to take other safety measures and the eu did of course bail out countries such as greece and ireland in the crisis seven years ago the difference is that italy is a much larger economy it is too important to fail but too big to save trumped running the world bank is as the name suggests one of the most important jobs on the planet given its role in reducing extreme poverty and combating climate change which is why there is such intense interest in the new president david malpass who is widely feared to be a cat s paw for donald trump first daughter ivanka who had been rumoured as a contender for the post herself even played a role in his selection attracting attention david malpass is widely feared to be a cat s paw for donald trump china is a big issue both malpass and christine lagarde the imf managing director made clear that they want beijing to be more transparent about it lending to emerging markets or risk swamping some of the world s poorest countries under a pile of debt they cannot repay that is sensible as is a change in the world bank s relationship with china now that it is a major world economic power it needs to shift from being a borrower to a donor and stakeholder in the bank development officials fear malpass will use the bank as a vehicle to pursue the trumpian america first approach but so far he seems very much on message uber and out some phenomenal figures from the uber float which could value the company at as much as 100bn boss travis kalanick could find his stake valued at 6 6billion not bad going for a business that made a multi billion dollar loss in 2018 having used the uber app for the first time this week in washington dc i have to say the idea and the service are brilliant being able to zip around cities quickly and safely without having to scrabble for cash anywhere in the world is an amazing innovation uber s outlook the technology is great but investors should expect a bumpy ride but there are plenty of possible downsides investors have been prepared to back companies like uber with big ideas even though these come with big losses partly in the hope of huge eventual gains but also because interest rates are so low and the opportunity cost of investing is not too heavy as rates begin to change they may be less willing to support serial loss makers there is also the threat of competition from the likes of lyft and of large costs if drivers have to be classed as employees not self employed the technology is great but investors should expect a bumpy ride

saddled with the responsibility of securing financial stability and sustainable economic growth the international monetary fund imf and world bank has warned that by 2030 nine in ten extremely poor people in the world will be africans the international development agencies raised concerns over the impending growth forecast in poverty at the ongoing 2019 spring meeting in washington d c newly appointed world bank president david malpass and imf s managing director christine lagarde both agreed that the economic crisis is attributable to some financial stress in large emerging markets also contributing to the malaise is corruption and mismanagement of public funds lack of transparency and accountability as well as a constant incurring of debts by african countries consequently several factors and solutions were discussed to help revive african economies warning against chinese loans imf recommends that nigeria and other developing countries should shun loans from china this is because the loans do not align with the paris club arrangements and sometimes may not be beneficial to the borrowers speaking on this financial counsellor and director of the imf s monetary and capital market department tobias adrian urged countries to make sure that when they borrow from abroad the terms are favourable for them in particular we tend to recommend that loans to countries should be conforming to paris club arrangements and that is not always the case in the case of loans from china adrian said not only are these loans unfavourable sometimes but most developing countries also lack proper management and good governance to channel these funds into the right sectors for instance countries like zambia have had to give up its state owned kannet kaunda airport national broadcasting corporation and zesco power plant as a resultant effect of its default on the loan from the asian country while nigeria was in total indebtedness of 3 22 billion to china as at the end of 2017 according to the debt management office dbo adrian called on emerging markets making volatile capital flows to limit their dependence on short term overseas debt as well as policymakers to develop tools that can help sustain the financial system ending fuel subsidy the imf also advised against the continual subsidies placed on fuel by nigeria and other developing countries alike the fund said the removal of fuel subsidy will help boost revenue and improve local infrastructure and other social services as observed by lagarde nigeria ranks amongst countries with the lowest tax to gdp ratio which signifies low revenue mobilization for the government and the only way to fill in the gap is to remove subsidy rightly so fuel subsidy in nigeria cost about 5 2 trillion between 2015 till date thus its removal will free up funds to provide other basic amenities like hospitals schools and other infrastructure needed to move the nation forward tax incentives hurting the economy in line with the issue of revenue mobilization the imf has told nigeria to adopt a tax reform that cuts down on incentives and exemptions removing tax exemptions would increase the country s capacity to generate internal revenue thereby reducing its total dependence on oil for income this recommendation comes a few days after the nigerian government announced its decision to increase value added tax vat from 5 percent more aggressive tax reforms will also help to sustain and increase nigeria s revenue base tightened fiscal policy gita gopinath chief economist at the imf recommended that a more rigid fiscal policy will be good for nigeria fiscal policy needs to tighten further for which mobilizing more non oil revenue is very important the economist said some of the benefits of a tight monetary system include the monitoring of cash flows alongside lower credit rates with the growth projections earlier released by the imf and world bank african countries are in need of a detailed structural reform that will cause growth both in the private and public sector
news national by bloomberg for autocratic leaders seeking lessons from the toppling of sudanese president omar al bashir avoiding a currency crisis may be the key to survival it s the same problem that did for long standing rulers from angola to zimbabwe and may yet claim venezuela s nicolas maduro al bashir who the military ousted on thursday to end 30 years of rule faced months of protests against the government s economic mismanagement repression and corruption one of the root causes of the 75 year old s downfall was his inability to manage a shortage of foreign exchange that sent inflation soaring and hammered living standards sudan s woes can be traced back to the secession of south sudan in 2011 which saw it lose almost all its oil fields and 60 percent of fiscal revenue according to the institute of international finance but the government s decision to ramp up spending while pegging its currency only exacerbated the situation with the loss of oil revenue the government monetised the deficit causing inflation to spiral and reserves to dwindle as the central bank maintained an overvalued exchange rate jonah rosenthal and garbis iradian economists at the washington based iif said in a note thursday the central bank devalued the pound almost 40 percent to 47 5 per dollar in october but it was too little too late the currency s black market rate tumbled again and now stands at around 75 against the greenback inflation is almost 120 percent according to steve hanke a professor of applied economics at johns hopkins university in baltimore al bashir is far from the only strongman to come unstuck in recent years thanks to a balance of payments crisis robert mugabe was pushed out by zimbabwe s army in 2017 as a dollar squeeze caused havoc in the southern african nation while the ruling party in angola pressured president jose eduardo dos santos to resign earlier than he wanted in the same year tellingly one of the first things his successor joao lourenco did was devalue the kwanza to try and end a dire scarcity of hard currency and algeria s abdelaziz bouteflika who was forced out of power this month faced his own currency problems the 2014 crash in oil and gas prices crimped the arab nation s dollar earnings while it avoided the kind of economic pain seen in sudan it spent more than 100 billion of reserves to prop up the dinar and avoid tough measures such as a major devaluation or turning to the international monetary fund for a bailout in venezuela where inflation is more than one million percent making the bolivar all but worthless maduro has managed to hold on thanks to continued support from the military and outside powers such as russia but if sudan and zimbabwe are a guide he ll also need to solve the currency chaos nobody survives hyperinflation daniel osorio president of new york based andean capital advisors which advises money managers on latin america said thursday at a debt conference in washington sooner or later it pushes you out
everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by trevor hunnicutt washington reuters swiss monetary policy is appropriate for now but policymakers still have room to lower already negative interest rates further or use other policies if necessary swiss national bank chairman thomas jordan said on saturday there is no reason to change monetary policy given the bank s dropping inflation forecasts and no risk of the country s economy overheating jordan told a news conference on saturday on the sidelines of the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings in washington related stories but jordan said the central bank still has more it can do if conditions warrant intervention we always stress the point that we have still room to lower interest rates further and we have also room to use the balance sheet if necessary for interventions in foreign exchange markets both instruments are here to use depending on the situation central banks have been cautiously awaiting a resolution of a host of potential threats to growth including the u s china trade negotiations and a global economic slowdown that has been felt in europe the imf said earlier this month that switzerland s economic growth is expected to slow to 1 1 percent in 2019 before a moderate recovery in 2020 citing those risks the swiss central bank has kept policy particularly loose using negative interest rates of 0 75 percent that means it charges commercial banks for cash they hold over a certain limit and is one of the central bank s tools to combat the rise of the swiss franc and maintain price stability in the country it has also intervened in the currency markets to stem the rise in the safe haven franc which hit its highest level in 20 months in recent weeks against the euro creating a headache for the export reliant economy the currency has since given back some recent gains but jordan on saturday described the franc as still highly valued negative interest rates meanwhile have come under fire from banks for reducing their returns jordan said the swiss central bank took effects of negative rates on banks into account in designing its policy he said the profits of the banking system have been relatively stable the system was built in a way that alleviated the pressure on banks from the beginning by exempting some bank reserves from charges for keeping their money with the central bank but jordan said it was important to keep an eye on risks unique to a world where many central banks set low or negative interest rates european central bank president mario draghi said this week that his central bank will consider whether preserving its own negative interest rate regime is causing possible side effects on bank s willingness and ability to lend that need to be mitigated further reporting by trevor hunnicutt editing by paul simao and andrea ricci

behind the rally in global debt markets lurks a disaster just waiting to happen at least that s what some long time market watchers are warning while dovish comments by the federal reserve and other central banks have prompted investors to pile back into bonds two troubling developments could make buyers uniquely vulnerable to deep and painful losses they say one is the sheer amount of ultra low yielding debt which means investors have almost no buffer in the event prices drop that s compounded by the worry liquidity will suddenly evaporate in a selloff and leave holders stuck with losses on positions they can t get out of quickly granted nobody is actually predicting when things will turn ugly in the bond market and history hasn t been particularly kind to the doomsayers still the risk is real they say and caution is more than justified by one measure the amount of investment grade bonds has doubled to 52 trillion since the financial crisis and yields have on average fallen to roughly 1 8 percent less than half the level in 2007 if they were to rise by a mere half percentage point investors could be looking at almost 2 trillion in losses this is an element of hidden leverage that is not appreciated says jeffrey snider global head of research at alhambra investments we are eventually going to have a shock the current situation is a legacy of the easy money polices enacted by central banks following the financial crisis with interest rates at or near zero governments and corporations went on a historic borrowing binge and investors gorged on debt that yielded little in return what s more rules to strengthen financial firms and curb their risk taking meant the big banks now played a much smaller role as intermediaries transferring more of the risk of getting in and out of trades onto investors these worries aren t new of course but they ve attracted fresh attention as the amount of negative yielding debt has climbed past 10 trillion to some it s a sign investors have gotten a little too complacent and could easily get blindsided once growth and inflation start to pick up on friday yields on benchmark 10 year treasuries rose to 2 55 percent the highest in nearly a month after chinese data bolstered optimism in the global economy one way to assess just how much risk has been built into the bond market is by looking at something called duration simply put it measures how much the price of a bond moves relative to a move in its yield currently the duration of 52 trillion of investment grade bonds tracked by bloomberg globally stands at about 7 close to a record high bonds with low yields and long maturity dates tend to have the highest duration that means if yields rose a full percentage point the bonds would lose 7 percent of their market value for a half percentage point jump that works out to 3 5 percent or a 1 8 trillion loss the debt load in the world is so high now that it can t withstand any historically normal size of interest rate increases anymore says stephen jen chief executive officer of eurizon slj capital the risk of getting left behind when everyone heads for the exits is something elaine stokes takes to heart the loomis sayles money manager says when she screens for securities to buy the ability to get out of the trade is a key factor that concern was underscored by jpmorgan chase s jamie dimon who wrote in his annual shareholder letter that investors face a new normal of reduced liquidity and heightened volatility because of tighter regulations there are fewer market makers out there and way more investment grade and sovereign bonds stokes says even in treasuries the most liquid market in times of heightened volatility she says the ability to transact without moving prices has declined to be sure you could make the case that dealers were never in the business of taking losses for their clients and that you d rather have investors take it on the chin than have banks freewheeling in the markets which almost brought down the entire financial system in 2008 or that reduced liquidity is a feature rather than a bug plus you rarely hear investors complaining that people aren t willing to part with their bonds when prices are rising only that they can t unload their positions when they re falling there s evidence market depth predictably drops during bouts of high volatility but the question rests on whether the situation is materially worse than it s been in the past an analysis by jpmorgan suggests that while liquidity in the treasury market has actually improved from its lows it s still well below pre crisis levels in december when investors sought out haven assets as equities sank the bank s analysis showed end of year market depth for treasuries fell twice as much as the average in the previous five years that doesn t bode well for less liquid risk assets the issue is whether there will be enough liquidity in asset markets when everybody wants to redeem funds at the same time says nellie liang a former fed staff economist who s now a researcher at the brookings institution she sees the biggest risks in funds and etfs for less liquid assets like certain corporate bonds leveraged loans and emerging market debt concerns about liquidity aren t confined to debt even in the 5 1 trillion a day market for foreign exchange illiquidity has manifested itself in a series of mini flash crashes most recently traders were blindsided by a seven minute surge in the yen versus the dollar which took place during the witching hour a period between new york s market close and the opening of trading in tokyo when volumes tend to thin out andrew maack head of foreign exchange trading at vanguard says flash events have become more common as algorithmic trading programs begin to outnumber humans according to jpmorgan s annual survey currency traders said liquidity will be the biggest daily challenge of 2019 to jpmorgan s chinedum nzelu concerns about liquidity really come down to being able to get in and out of trades when it counts bianco research s jim bianco says extraordinarily loose monetary policies have buoyed financial markets for so long that investors might be lulled into a false sense of security right now there s a lot of support for these debt markets from the central banks he said but what happens when economies get stronger and the central banks want to get out and so does everybody else then you really will have a problem on your hands

singapore s central bank left its monetary policy unchanged on friday broadly expected by economists as it observes of a slower economy that is likely to expand at a moderate pace in the coming quarters due to the slower growth weaker global oil prices and a stronger impact from the liberalisation of the retail electricity market the monetary authority of singapore mas downgraded its forecast range for core inflation this year to 1 2 from the previous 1 5 2 5 against an expected slowdown in global growth the central bank forecasts singapore s economy to expand by 1 5 3 5 this year mas will therefore maintain the current rate of appreciation of the singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate s neer policy band there will be no change to its width and the level at which it is centred this policy stance is consistent with a modest and gradual appreciation path of the s neer policy band that will ensure medium term price stability it said singapore s economic growth to expand at a moderate pace in the bi annual monetary policy statement the mas said singapore s economic growth has slowed and is likely to expand at a modest pace in the coming quarters advance estimates from the ministry of trade and industry showed the country s first quarter growth at 1 3 lower than the fourth quarter s 1 9 increase and economists expectations of a 1 5 gain the mas said the contribution from the manufacturing sector has waned over the last six months reflecting the maturing of the global electronics cycle and the economic slowdown in china meanwhile activity in the services sectors stayed firm supported mainly by financial and business services as well as information and communications services the mas said the construction sector has also recovered from a protracted period of weakness despite some pickup in labour costs inflationary pressures are mild and should remain contained it added global growth expected to slow the growth momentum of the global economy has moderated by more than expected at the turn of the year alongside sluggish trade the mas said cautioning that significant uncertainty remains over the short term outlook however the central bank noted that policy stances in china and the united states have become more accommodative while global financial conditions have eased all in global growth for 2019 is forecast to slow following the strong expansions in the last two years it said

interesting things product some of the most fascinating topics covered this week are trashonomics living off zuckerberg s waste bin psychology why the brain hates slowpokes society caste aesthetics science promise and perils of synthetic biology entertainment inside the making of three identical strangers politics millennials don t have a taste for politics and economics should the world brace for china s minsky moment here are the ten most interesting pieces that we read this week ended april 12 2019 source nautilus in this fast paced world we are always in a hurry slow drivers slow internet slow grocery lines they all drive us crazy earlier when watching a video on youtube most of the time would go watching the video buffer but now even if the video stops for buffering for even a second we get impatient things that our great great grandparents would have found miraculously efficient now drive us around the bend patience is a virtue that s been vanquished in the twitter age why are we impatient it s a heritage from our evolution says marc wittmann a psychologist at the institute for frontier areas of psychology and mental health in freiburg germany impatience made sure we didn t die from spending too long on a single unrewarding activity it gave us the impulse to act society continues to pick up speed like a racer on bonneville speedway in his book social acceleration a new theory of modernity hartmut rosa informs us that the speed of human movement from pre modern times to now has increased by a factor of 100 the speed of communications has skyrocketed by a factor of 10 million in the 20th century and data transmission has soared by a factor of around 10 billion the pace of our lives is linked to culture researchers have shown society s accelerating pace is shredding our patience in tests psychologists and economists have asked subjects if they would prefer a little bit of something now or a lot of it later say 10 today versus 100 in a year or two pieces of food now versus six pieces in 10 seconds subjects both human and other animals often go for the now even when it s not optimal the rush of society may affect our sense of timing and emotions in another way neuroscientists like moore have shown that time seems to pass faster when we have a direct connection to a subsequent event when we feel we ve caused a particular outcome they call the experience temporal binding conversely says moore when we have or feel we have no control over events the opposite happens the internal clock speeds up meaning we experience intervals as longer can we stave off the slowness rage and revive patience it s possible but we need to find a way to reset our internal timers and unwarp time we can try willpower to push back our feelings but that only goes so far also research has shown meditation and mindfulness a practice of focusing on the present helps with impatience although it s not entirely clear why source times of india the us government revised its 2018 growth estimate down below 3 as economists were revising their 2019 forecasts down towards 2 triggering another wave of disappointed commentary about doggedly slow growth in the united states but it s not just an american story and it s not just president trump who won t deliver on promises of 3 4 or even 5 growth across the world economists have had to downgrade growth forecasts in most years since the global financial crisis of 2008 economists keep basing forecasts on trends established during the postwar miracle years when growth was boosted by expanding populations rising productivity and exploding debt but population and productivity growth had stagnated by 2008 and the financial crisis put an end to the debt binge the miracle is over even during the industrial revolution in the 19th century the world economy rarely grew faster than 2 5 a year until the post world war ii baby boom began to rapidly expand the labour force after 1950 the combination of more workers and more output per worker lifted the pace of global growth to 4 roughly economists should have expected that united states economic growth would slow to 2 from 3 and it has stimulus measures like the trump tax cuts can lift growth above this path but temporarily and at the risk of higher deficits and debt political leaders should not be trying to reverse the new age of slow growth they should be trying to explain to the public why it s not so bad slower growth in the working age population also means less competition for jobs which helps explain why unemployment is now at record lows not only in the united states but also in germany and japan not a bad thing economists on the right and left are now calling for lower interest rates or higher government spending to boost growth even if that risks reigniting inflation at the federal reserve there is an emerging view that letting inflation rise above 2 long considered a red line may not be unwise instead of trying to bring back the miracle years economists need to adjust their forecasts and politicians need to rethink their policies to the new era of slower growth because trying to recreate a bygone golden age is a shaky way to build the future source ours is a caste based society caste hierarchies create dominance and inequalities in the second half of the colonial period the hierarchies that solely existed on the fundamentals on caste for centuries began to break down the flourishing democracy changed everything after the 1990s globalization and the rise of the marginalized sped up the process of collapse the dominant communities would not part with the power that came along with caste for centuries whenever possible they sought to assert their caste dominance and hierarchy the marginalized continued to identify their rights by way of democracy and sought to establish their role in the bureaucracy the clash between the two entities constitutes the politics till date it is the duty of democratic politics to break the philosophy of caste power and work towards social equality but in recent history the political forces that were at least slowly accelerating this process have been pushed back and they have lost their power we have been experiencing the domination of forces that have successfully been able to give shape to such hegemonic philosophies the castes started to believe that it would be possible to retrieve the power that they lost to democracy hence caste organisations converted into political parties now the caste organisations are forming their political parties to perpetuate their power structures people organized by caste identify their leaders the leaders express the aspects that add pride to their caste they oppose any challenge to their caste this is the truth of the day when caste takes an upper hand freedom of expression and democracy take a backseat caste has no space for dialogue it has trained people to not question those in power the truth that caste pronounces loudly is that neither of freedom of expression nor democracy has space in our scheme of things source new york times jake orta is a trash collector who lives in a small single window studio apartment filled with trash just 3 blocks away from mark zuckerberg s 10 million tudor home in san francisco from mr zuckerberg s bin mr orta dug out a vacuum cleaner a hair dryer a coffee machine all in working condition and a pile of clothes that he carried home in a whole foods paper bag for years san francisco has been a global beacon of recycling attracting a stream of government ministers journalists and students from across the globe to study the sorting facilities of recology the company contracted to collect san francisco s garbage but the city is also full of young affluent people preoccupied with demanding jobs and long commutes for whom the garbage can is a tempting way to get rid of that extra pair of jeans or old electronics cluttering their closet trash pickers fall into several broad categories for decades elderly women and men have collected cardboard paper cans or bottles lugging impossibly large bags around the city and bringing them to recycling centers for cash trash pickers like mr orta are in yet another category targeting items in the black landfill garbage bins whose contents would otherwise go to what s known as the pit a hole in the ground on the outskirts of the city that resembles a giant swimming pool where non recyclable trash is crushed and compacted by a huge bulldozer and then carried by a fleet of trucks to a dump an hour and a half away the city exports about 50 large truckloads a day mr orta sells what he retrieves at impromptu markets on mission street or at a more formal market on saturdays on julian avenue children s toys sell very rarely because parents don t like the idea that they have come from the trash women s clothing is iffy but men don t seem to care as much where the clothing came from and jeans are easy to hawk for 5 or 10 a pair mr orta s favourite item retrieved from the trash is one that he will not sell a collection of newspapers from around the world documenting the course of

revelations in synthetic biology recently now genes can be written from scratch and edited repeatedly like text in a word processor it permits the manufacture of all manner of things which used to be hard even impossible to make pharmaceuticals fuels fabrics foods and fragrances can all be built molecule by molecule what cells do and what they can become is engineerable too progress may be slow but with the help of new tools and a big dollop of machine learning biological manufacturing could eventually yield truly cornucopian technologies use of synthetic biology can be seen in our daily lives burger king recently introduced into some of its restaurants a beefless whopper that gets its meatiness from an engineered plant protein such innovations could greatly ease a shift to less environmentally taxing diets they could also be used to do more with less the earliest biological transformation domestication produced what was hitherto the biggest change in how humans lived their lives haphazardly then purposefully humans bred cereals to be more bountiful livestock to be more docile dogs more obedient and cats more companionable the last a partial success at best this allowed new densities of settlement and new forms of social organisation the market the city the state humans domesticated themselves as well as their crops and animals creating space for the drudgery of subsistence agriculture and oppressive political hierarchies synthetic biology will have a similar cascading effect transforming humans relationships with each other and potentially their own biological nature the ability to reprogram the embryo is rightly the site of most of today s ethical concerns in future they may extend further what should one make of people with the upper body strength of gorillas or minds impervious to sorrow how humans may choose to change themselves biologically is hard to say that some choices will be controversial is not synthetic biology will challenge the human capacity for wisdom and foresight it might defeat it but carefully nurtured it might also help expand it source cnn entertainment in this interview tim wardle director of three identical strangers documentary talk about how they made this happen mr wardle and his team had spent four years working on their stranger than fiction documentary about triplets separated at birth and reunited 19 years later and they were finally ready to start shooting the film released in select us theaters last summer to critical acclaim and picked up plenty of buzz as it became one of the top grossing documentaries of 2018 the producer of this film grace hughes hallett says that s a crazy enough story to have about yourself as it is that you were separated at birth from a twin or a triplet the boys story had a whole other level of craziness on top of that in the way that they found each other and then the awful things that began to unravel as they discovered what really happened to them it took two years for the director and producer to flesh out the story and try to get funding for this project but the most important part was earning the trust of the three brothers mr wardle said when you think about the extent of what they ve been through and what s happened in their lives you understand why they might find it hard to trust people robert shafran one of the three brothers said that they were reluctant for this project due to various reasons the most obvious being the typical american s perspective on british sensationalistic newspapers they could sensationalize the crap out of this the brothers born in new york in 1961 were separated by adoption agency louise wise services their adoptive families had no clue that each son they brought home had been born as a triplet the brothers along with other multiples who were separated and sent home with different families were then secretly included in a years long study by child psychiatrist dr peter neubauer the results of neubauer s study were never published and the study s materials are being kept under seal at yale university in the end three identical strangers covers a lot of themes medical ethics mental health and the question of nature vs nurture among them but for some it really boils down to family lastly mr wardle says i think it s the toughest thing i ve done the thing i m proudest of is that three identical strangers has had a real world impact we managed to get the brothers access to files and videos that have been kept secret from them for six decades we know of at least one twin pair who have reunited after seeing the film and it has brought the triplets and their families much closer together source livemint in the coming elections youths have the power to make or break the government a recent report in the indian express observed that 81 million young indians will vote for the first time in the 2019 general elections and could decisively influence electoral outcomes in 282 parliamentary constituencies the report also said there will be an estimated average of 14 9 million first time eligible voters in each lok sabha constituency and this figure is larger than the winning margin in 297 seats in 2014 reports like these tacitly suggest that the first time voters unlike the older ones are impressionable and lacking in evolved political attitudes speculations about the political inclinations of the millennials will need to confront the stark sobering fact of high political indifference among the indian youth according to a 2016 report anxieties and aspirations of india s youth changing patterns by centre for the study of developing societies csds konrad adenauer stiftung kas which surveyed over 6 000 respondents aged between 15 and 34 years in 19 states 46 of indian youth have no interest at all in politics and 18 only have little interest the influence of gender on youth attitudes is strong and clear fewer women for instance are interested in politics than men in a graphic illustration of the power of patriarchy large numbers of male and female youth concur that wives should remain obedient to their husbands and not work outside the house also class and caste inequalities have major consequences for the social experience of youth the millennials among religious and ethnic minorities and lower castes experience higher job insecurity and workplace discrimination regional cultures offer a space of belonging in the lives of youth while many millennials strongly identify as indians regional identities also have a strong appeal to them it appears that the millennials share more with the older generations inside their states than with their peers elsewhere in india the urban and rural locations of the millennials therefore translate into a marked difference in their political values also the role of digital and social media plays an important role in shaping the views of the youth as they are literally always online the millennials in contemporary india inhabit very differing cultural predicaments any claims about them being a distinct political community therefore ought to seem shaky source quartz the trend of listening to music through vinyl records has almost vanished digital streaming of music has taken over now rarely will you find people listening to vinyl records now the price of a phonograph cylinder in its peak year of production in 1907 would be an estimated 13 88 10 58 in today s money compared to 10 89 for a shellac disc in its peak year of 1947 a vinyl album in its peak year of 1977 when the sex pistols never mind the bollocks came out cost 28 55 in today s money against 16 66 for a cassette tape in 1988 21 59 for a cd in 2000 and 11 11 for a digital album download in 2013 yet if consumers are paying an ever lower price for their music the picture looks very different when you start to look at environmental costs intuitively you might think that less physical product means far lower carbon emissions in 1977 for instance the industry used 58 million kilograms of plastic in the us by 1988 the peak year for cassettes this had dipped slightly to 56m kg when cds peaked in 2000 it was up to 61m kg of plastic then came the big digital dividend as downloading and streaming took over the amount of plastics used by the us recording industry dropped dramatically down to just 8m kg by 2016 but if these figures seem to confirm the notion that music digitalized is music dematerialized and therefore more environmentally friendly there s still the question of the energy used to power online music listening storing and processing music in the cloud depends on vast data centers that use a tremendous amount of resources and energy it is possible to demonstrate this by translating plastic production and the electricity used to store and transmit digital audio files into greenhouse gas equivalents ghgs this shows that ghgs from recorded music were 140m kg in 1977 in the us 136m kg in 1988 and 157m kg in 2000 by 2016 it is estimated to have been between 200m kg and over 350m kg and remember that this is only in the us are streaming platforms the right business model to facilitate that exchange is streaming music remotely from the cloud the most appropriate way to listen to music from the perspective of environmental sustainability there are no easy solutions but taking a moment to reflect on the costs of music and how they have changed over history is a step in the right direction source asia nikkei com housing prices all around the world are soaring and it s the same with china even in a so called second tier city like jinan a 100 square meter apartment would cost about 2 million yuan 297 000 china s once sizzling property market is showing signs of a slump adding to a growing list of warning signs about the chinese economy a massive building boom across china including in tier two cities like jinan has left as many as 65 million empty apartments across the country according to estimates by gan li a professor at southwestern university of finance and economics in chengdu sales volumes in 24 cities tracked by china real estate index system fell by 44 in the first week of 2019 compared with a year earlier though the four largest cities shanghai shenzhen guangzhou and beijing still saw a 12 increase the property slump has also triggered several episodes of social unrest which beijing seeks to avoid at all costs in october shanghai homebuyers came out in droves to protest a developer s decision to cut prices in an apartment complex the angry residents screamed slogans denouncing the developer and carried placards saying give us our hard earned blood and sweat money back even while the chinese government has stopped short of officially speaking out on the risks facing the property industry a top economist from a state controlled university recently sounded the alarm xiang songzuo a professor at the prestigious renmin university in beijing warned in a speech in shanghai on jan 20 that real estate is one of a few serious gray rhinos a potential risk that is obvious but ignored facing the economy this year according to his estimates about 80 of chinese people s wealth is in the form of real estate totaling over 65 trillion in value almost twice the size of all g 7 economies combined a significant slowdown could therefore have a substantial impact on citizens financial health to him chinese people have played around with leverage debts and finance and eventually created a mirage in a desert that will soon entirely collapse in response to the property slowdown some local governments have been quietly removing some restrictions on home purchases including by scrapping price caps for new units and relaxing the requirements for non local buyers in early january china s central bank also moved to lower the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves by 100 basis points freeing up a net of 800 billion yuan or 117 billion for new lending the pause in the upward property cycle has dashed the hopes of making quick profits in the housing market as a result homebuyers

right the u s economy continues to enjoy its goldilocks moment at least with respect to inflation consumer prices rose 1 9 year on year in march up from 1 5 in february largely driven by increases in energy prices chart 1 core inflation came in at 2 0 and while not the fed s preferred metric is consistent with price pressures running neither too high nor too low several months of muted inflation readings have strengthened the fed s decision to keep rates where they are minutes of the march meeting showed that board members saw little in the data to prompt a shift in policy this rhetoric is expected to continue through the end of 2019 with signs of an improving labor market balanced against risks to growth from a struggling global economy the fed s european counterpart the ecb on the other hand while leaving rates unchanged this week signaled that there could be substantive changes to monetary policy at their next meeting in june with anemic growth among member countries and lingering policy uncertainty it signalled a willingness to act to ensure a return of inflation to target and bolster the region s faltering growth on the trade front relations with china seem to have taken a turn for the better with talks between high level officials ongoing as cooler heads prevail in one trade negotiation however disputes are heating up in another the u s is threatening to impose tariffs on approximately 11 billion of eu imports the threat comes after 14 years of litigation at the wto over subsidies for european aircraft manufacturer airbus which america argues puts u s based boeing at a disadvantage the u s emphasizes that this move is independent of current ongoing trade talks with the bloc but the timing could be seen as an attempt to gain leverage in those negotiations boeing for its part continues to deal with fallout from the grounding of its 737 max airliners there were no commercial orders for the product in march the first time this has occurred since may 2012 boeing will reduce production of the jet starting mid april while it works to fix flaws with the model which resulted in two fatal crashes if the production cut lasts to the end of the quarter they

end of may or risk exiting without a deal on june 1st given these and other uncertainties the imf downgraded projections for global growth in 2019 to 3 3 citing ongoing trade tensions and declining confidence chart 2 this brings their forecast in line with our own view published in march growth in 2020 is expected to rebound to 3 6 slightly above our expectation for 3 5 growth canada a quiet week puts all eyes on ontario it was a relatively quiet week the most notable event in markets was the canadian government 10 year bond yield rising back above the overnight rate for the first time in a month ending the recent episode of yield curve inversion crude oil prices saw some volatility through the week but look set to end it a bit higher than where they began the economic calendar was thin with only a few bits of new housing data to slake analysts thirst perhaps the biggest event was the first budget from ontario s pc party the ontario budget was bound to be more closely watched than normal given the challenging fiscal position notably a 2018 2019 budget deficit not too different from the federal gap and a commitment to returning to balance the plan to meet that promise is set to take five years and as discussed in our commentary rests largely on spending restraint program spending growth will be held to roughly 1 per year while revenue growth is forecast to average around 3 running revenue growth above spending should gradually shrink the deficit with a small surplus predicted for 2023 24 net debt to gdp is forecast to rise a bit further in the near term before bending lower hitting 38 6 in the final year of the plan versus 40 2 today on the revenue side the major near term change is the introduction of a refundable childcare tax credit the corporate tax rate was left untouched with the previously announced accelerated capital cost allowance standing in its place a cut to the middle income tax rate is still planned but is forecast for year three of the mandate expenditure controls are notable in the education and post secondary spending categories with several zero growth years forecast for the former and an outright decline this fiscal year for the latter healthcare spending is to be held to a sub inflation pace of 1 6 per year less than half its recent trend all told the budget provides restraint but with an approach that should have only a modest negative impact on the province s economic growth outlook on the data front housing was in the spotlight first up were housing starts these rebounded to 192 5k annualized units in march after a downwardly revised 166k february report the rebound was welcome and was enough to keep the trend north of 200k still the first quarter as a whole marked a very soft start to the year starts were down 14 compared with the final quarter of 2018 chart 1 this was the worst quarterly performance since 2009 with activity in the single family home segment leading the way the softness in february was confirmed by statistics canada s release of building permits data chart 2 the value of permits issued fell roughly 6 month on month for a second month taking the series back to early 2017 levels the main culprit was residential multis i e condos although permits for non residential construction were down for a second month the permits data can be pretty noisy but when taken together with soft

as the weather warms up in the northern hemisphere from a bitter winter there is concern that the world is moving towards a synchronised global slowdown this is a massive contrast to only a year ago when the consensus was optimistic of a synchronised global recovery this slowdown is mostly man made the biggest dampener being the us china trade tensions which aggravated the cyclical chinese slowdown last year on the back of reforms aimed at getting a grip on the debt overhang as brexit moved from tragedy to farce europe also slowed when populist unrests sparked off a huge internal debate on how to deal with the new unknowns

morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chase s first quarter 2019 earnings call this call is being recorded at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chase s chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer marianne lake advertisement advertisement ms lake please go ahead marianne lake chief financial officer thank you operator good morning everybody i m going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation starting on page 1 the firm reported record net income of 9 2 billion and eps of 2 65 on record revenue of nearly 30 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 19 the results this quarter were strong and broad based highlights include core loan growth ex cib of 5 with loan trends continuing to progress as expected advertisement advertisement more from the motley fool credit performance remained strong across businesses we saw record client investment assets in consumer of over 300 billion and record new money flows this quarter and double digit growth in both card sales and merchant processing volumes up 10 and 13 respectively we ranked no 1 in global ib fees and gained meaningful share with share well above 9 this quarter in the commercial bank we had record growth ib revenue in asset wealth management record aum and client assets and the firm delivered another quarter of strong positive operating leverage turning to page 2 and talking into more detail about the first quarter revenue of 29 9 billion was up 1 3 million or 5 year on year driven by net interest income which was up 1 1 million or 8 on higher rates as well as balance sheet growth and mix noninterest revenue was up slightly as reported but excluding fair value gains on the implementation of a new accounting standard last year nir would have been up 5 reflecting auto lease growth and strong investment banking fees and while markets revenue was lower there were other items more than offsetting advertisement advertisement expense of 16 4 billion was up 2 relating to continued investments we re making in technology real estate marketing and front office partially offset by a reduction in fdic charges of a little over 200 million credit remained favorable across both consumer and wholesale credit costs of 1 5 billion were up 330 million year on year driven by changes in wholesale reserves in consumer charge offs were in line with expectations and there were no changes to reserve this quarter in wholesale we had about 180 million of credit costs driven by reserve build on select c i client downgrades and recall that there was a net release last year related to energy once again these downgrades were idiosyncratic it was a handful of names and across sectors net reserve builds of this order of magnitude are extremely modest given the size of our portfolios and we are not seeing signs of deterioration moving on to page 3 and balance sheet and capital we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of 12 1 up modestly from last quarter with the benefit of strong earnings and aoci gains given rallying rates being partially offset by slightly higher risk weighted assets rwa is up primarily due to higher counterparty credit on trading activity but notably this quarter being offset by lower loans across businesses on a spot basis quarter on quarter loans were down in home lending as a result of a loan sale transaction in the cib and the result of a large syndication and in card and asset wealth management seasoning also in the page total assets are up over 100 billion quarter on quarter principally driven by higher cib trading assets in part a normalization from lower levels at the end of the year given market conditions lower end of period loans are partially offset by treasury balances including higher securities in the quarter the firm distributed 7 4 billion of capital to shareholders including 4 7 billion of share repurchases as pre submitted our 2019 ccar capital plan for the federal reserve moving to consumer community banking on page 4 advertisement advertisement ccb generated net income of 4 billion and an roe of 30 with consumers remaining strong and confident core loans were up 4 here year on year driven by home lending and cards both up 6 and business banking up 3 deposits grew 3 in line with our expectations and we believe we continue to outperform client investment assets were up 13 driven by record new money flows reflecting growth across physical and digital channels including you invest we also announced plans to open 90 branches this year in new markets revenue of 13 8 billion was up 9 consumer business banking revenue up 15 on higher deposit nii driven by continued margin expansion home lending revenue was down 11 driven by net servicing revenue on both lower operating revenue and msr but notably while volumes are down production revenue is up nicely year on year on disciplined pricing and cards merchant services auto revenues was up 9 driven by higher card nii on loan growth and margin expansion and higher auto lease volumes expense of 7 2 billion was up 4 driven by investments in the business and auto lease depreciation partially offset by expense efficiencies and lower fdic charges on credit net charge offs were flat as lower charge offs in home lending and auto were offset by higher charge offs in card on loan growth charge off rates were down year on year across lending portfolios now turning to page 5 and the corporate investment bank cib reported net income of 3 3 billion and an roe of 16 on strong revenue performance of nearly 10 billion for the quarter ib revenue of 1 7 billion was up 10 year on year advertisement advertisement and outside of an accounting nuance all of advisory dcm and total ib fees would have been records for a first quarter advisory fees were up 12 in a market that was down benefiting from a number of large deals closing this quarter we ranked no 1 in announced dollar volumes and gained nearly 100 basis points of volume share debt underwriting fees were up 21 also outperforming a market that was down driven by large acquisition financing deals and our continued strong lead left positions in leveraged finance we maintained our no 1 rank and gained well over 100 basis points of share and equity underwriting fees were down 23 but in a market down more as the combination of the government shutdown uncertainty around brexit and residual impacts from december volatility weighed on issuance activity across the regions in the first quarter but already in the second quarter we ve seen a major recovery in u s ipo volumes back to normalized levels and we are benefiting from our leadership in the technology and healthcare sectors which again dominate the calendar moving to markets total revenue was 5 5 billion down 17 reported or down 10 adjusted for the impact of the accounting standard last year that i referred to big picture on a year on year basis we are challenged by a tough comparison the backdrop in the first quarter of 18 was supportive clients were active and we saw broad based strength in performance with a clear record in equities last year in contrast this quarter started relatively slowly and overhanging uncertainties kept clients on the sidelines despite a recovered and more favorable environment so with that in mind i would categorize results as solid and a little better than we thought at investor day just a few weeks ago largely due to a better second half of march advertisement advertisement and for all it s worth so far environment in april feels generally constructive but it s too early to draw any conclusions in terms of p l fixed income markets revenue was down 8 adjusted driven by lower activity particularly in rates and in currencies emerging markets which normalized following a strong prior year however we did see relative strength in credit trading on strong flow as well as in commodities equities revenue was down 13 adjusted speaking more to the record prior year quarter than this quarter s performance which was still generally strong across products although derivatives got off to a somewhat slower start cash in particular nearly matched last year s exceptional result treasury services revenue was 1 1 billion up 3 year on year benefiting from higher balances and payments volume being partially offset by deposit margin compression securities services revenue was 1 billion down 4 as organic growth was more than offset by fee and deposit margin compression lower market levels and the impact of a business exit of note deposit margin in both treasury services and securities services is impacted by funding basis compression rather than client basis and at the firmwide level was an offset finally expense of 5 5 billion was down 4 driven by lower performance based compensation and lower fdic charges partially offset by continued investments in the business the cost of revenue ratio for the quarter was 30 moving to commercial banking on page 6 a strong quarter for the commercial bank with net income of 1 1 billion and an roe of 19 revenue of 2 3 billion was up 8 year on year on strong investment banking performance and higher deposit nii record gross ib revenue of over 800 million was up more than 40 year on year due to several large transactions and the pipeline continues to feel robust and active deposit balances were down 5 year on year and 1 sequentially as migration of nonoperating deposits to higher yielding alternatives have decelerated and we believe is largely behind us from here we expect deposits to stabilize given the benign rate outlook advertisement advertisement expense of 873 million was up 3 year on year as we continue to invest in the business in banker coverage and technology loans were up 2 year on year and flat sequentially c i loans were up 2 or up 5 adjusted for the conceded runoff in our tax exempt portfolio we continue to see solid growth across expansion market and specialized industries cre loans were up 1 as competition remains elevated and we continue to maintain discipline given where we are in the cycle finally credit costs of 90 million were predominantly driven by higher reserves from select client downgrades and net charge offs were only two basis points on strong underlying performance before we move on i want to address the perceived gap between our reported c i growth statistics and those that we all see the fed s weekly data if we look across all of our wholesale businesses we also show strong growth year on year at about 8 but there are three comments i would make the first is that there can be reasonable noise in the fed weekly data second cib is a big contributor for us and cib loan growth this quarter was supported by robust acquisition financing and higher market loans and third as previously noted the definition of c i for the fed does not include our tax exempt portfolio which has seen significant year on year declines given tax reform so while it s true that the fed data is showing strong growth year on year and apples to apples roe in the mainstream middle market landing space we re seeing good mid single digit demand in line with our expectations moving on to asset wealth management on page 7 asset wealth management reported net income of 661 million with a pre tax margin of 24 and an roe of 25 revenue of 3 5 billion for the quarter was flat year on year as lower management fees on average market levels as well as lower brokerage activity were offset by higher investment valuation gains expense of 2 6 billion was up 3 year on year as continued investments in our business as well as other headcount related expenses were partially offset by lower external fees for the quarter we saw net long term inflows of 10 billion with strength in fixed income partially offset by outflows from other asset classes additionally we had net liquidity outflows of 5 billion advertisement advertisement aum of 2 1 trillion and overall client assets of 2 9 trillion were both up 4 driven by cumulative net inflows into liquidity and long term products and with first quarter market performance nearly offsetting fourth quarter declines deposits were up 4 sequentially on seasonality and down 4 year on year reflecting continued migration into investments although decelerating and we continue to capture the vast majority of these flows finally we had record loan balances up 10 with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending moving to page 8 and corporate corporate reported net income of 251 million with net revenue of 425 million compared to a net loss of over 200 million last year the improvement was driven by higher nii on higher rates as well as cash deployment opportunities in treasury and recall last year we had nearly 250 million of net losses on security sales relative to a small net gain this quarter expense of 211 million is up year on year and includes the contribution to the foundation of 100 million this quarter concluding on page 9 to wrap up this is the sort of quarter that really showcases the strength of the firm s operating model benefiting from diversification and scale and our consistent investment agenda we delivered record revenue and net income in a clean first quarter performance despite some hangover from the fourth quarter underlying drivers across our businesses continue to propel us forward and in march and coming into april the economic backdrop feels increasingly constructive client sentiment has recovered and recent global data shows encouraging momentum investor day is only six weeks behind us so our guidance for the full year hasn t changed we do remain well positioned and optimistic about the firm s performance advertisement advertisement with that operator we ll take questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous john mcdonald autonomous research analyst hi good morning marianne you had good expense control this quarter in your jamie s letter you show goals of improving the efficiency ratio in each of the main business units for the next few years just kind of wondering what s driving that is there any kind of cresting of investment spend that s going to occur in 2020 or is this just kind of positive operating leverage carrying through marianne lake chief financial officer yes hey john so i would say just big picture it s the combination of both obviously we talked at investor day about the fact that we re always going to make the net investment the net incremental investment decision based on its own merits but in total with the amount we re spending now and the amount of dollars that roll off every year that get repositioned for investment we feel like we should see our net investment spend reach a reasonable plateau over the course of the next several years and so that is part of it obviously a lot of the investments that we ve been making in technology are also not only to do with customer service and risk management and revenue generation but they re also to do with operating efficiency so we would also expect to start to see some of that drive operating leverage but it s also the case that we re looking for revenue growth too so it s a combination of both john mcdonald autonomous research analyst ok and then just on the nii outlook it s reassuring to be able to hold the investor day outlook of the 58 billion for this year even though the curve s flattened there were some concerns there what are the dynamics that enable you to keep the guidance even with the change in curve that we ve seen marianne lake chief financial officer yes so i mean the first thing i would say is that we talked we ve said this before when we ve seen these periods where you get kind of short term fluctuations in the curve is that it s a bit dangerous to chase it up and down every month or so and so in the big picture we said 58 plus billion yes it s true that a persistent flatter curve would have a small net drag on carry and we re not immune to that so there is a little bit of pressure as a result of that if it is persistent at this level throughout the year but we continue to grow our loans and our deposits and against that there s a mixed bag of lower for longer so while we may not have a tailwind of higher rates we also may not have the same kinds of pressures that we would see on bases necessarily and while lower long end rates may be a net small drag in the short term on earnings they re good for credit on the balance sheet and you could argue a patient fed and lower rates for longer may elongate the cycle so net net there are pluses and minuses i would say there may be some pressure as a result of that if it s persistent but it s modest operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo wells fargo analyst hi you mentioned consumer deposit growth is outperforming where you get average consumer deposits up over 20 billion year over year so those are the numbers i just i was hoping for a little bit more on the why and to what degree does that reflect your buildout of branches how is that deposit growth going how much of this is related to digital banking and then how much would be due to simply a perception that you have superior strength i know that came up during the ceo hearings the imf study saying that you get a benefit due to a perception of being too big to fail thanks marianne lake chief financial officer yes so look i would say there s lots of different opportunities for people to get insured deposit so come back to the third point but all of that plays a piece so you ll recall that we built a large number of branches following the financial crisis as we densified our position in new market being california and florida and nevada and the like and so we do have a decent portion of our branches that are still in their maturation phase and so we re definitely seeing some growth in deposits there i also firmly believe and we talked about it many many times that we ve been investing consistently over the last decade in customer experience customer satisfaction in our consumer bank is at an all time high and continues to increase consecutively digital products new products and services value propositions to our customers convenience new markets all of which i think are increasingly important to our customers as well as obviously a number of other factors so to me it s the combination of all of the above and less so at this point a perception of a flight to quality the people have a lot of choices year over year i would say we re seeing deposit growth slow exactly in line with our expectations but this year the slowdown speaks a little bit more as far as we can see to higher consumer spend and a little bit less to do with deposit flows out to rate seeking alternatives so customers are voting with their business they re bringing deposits to us and i think it speaks to a combination of the investments we re making and also including branches mike mayo wells fargo analyst so how much of the deposit growth is due to digital banking can you quantify that or give us a ballpark figure marianne lake chief financial officer well i can tell you that and so it s not just our deposit growth as well remember it s also about investment assets and we talked about our digital offerings providing headwind there so i don t have a breakout for you we can follow up it deepens on our branch growth the reason why we continue to believe in a physical and digital combined channel presence both are important but we can get back to you operator your next question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi glenn schorr evercore isi analyst hi thanks very much on sec services i heard you loud and clear about the funding basis compression being part of the answer on revs down could you talk about the business exit i wasn t aware of that and how big that it is and then flip to the better side you also did mention about organic growth we haven t heard too much since the big 1 trillion win but i know there s stuff going on underneath the covers talk about what type of business you are winning there marianne lake chief financial officer yes so on the business exit this is it s the sort of feature we re always talking about year over year that to me this feels like really old news it was a u s broker dealer exit that we talked about many quarters ago but obviously we re still on a year over year basis for another couple of quarters going to see the impact of that on our revenues it s about 20 just over a 20 million year over year revenue negative impact but it s relatively speaking old news in terms of the exit took place last year lower market levels were about an equivalent drag on revenues and then we are seeing solid underlying growth but this is a very competitive environment and as we are growing our assets on our custody assets and as we re growing and winning new mandates these are under competitive pressures and it also depends on mixer so there s a bunch of factors going on what we re focused on is for both of these businesses that the long term growth opportunities are very big and the organic growth in the underlying businesses are performing well and even with these revenue pressures we re focused on continuing to drive efficiencies and these are good roe businesses above mid teens can i i m sorry can i just make one more comment mike i didn t say this on the digital space but i think it s important as we think going forward that as we think not just about our digital assets but digital account opening and that has been a feature of how we re attracting new account 25 of checking production 40 of savings production now able to be opened digitally so increasingly digital will be a driver but we will get back to you with the mixes sorry glenn schorr evercore isi analyst all right marianne just one quick qualifier on the seven hour marathon the other day in d c besides finding out jamie s a capitalist that s shocking news one of risks that i think the group talked about was in the private credit markets and nonbank lending and i just wanted to get a little qualifier of that i m pretty sure you didn t mean the exposure jpmorgan has to those it s just more of risk being taken but if you can just expand on that that would be helpful marianne lake chief financial officer yes so for sure the comment is more about the overall risk in the environment and not about our risks to those sectors and our risks are all the things that we ve always told you about which are relatively modest relatively senior well secured well diversified we look at not just under a variety of stress scenarios are manageable the comments are really about the percentage of leveraged lending or the percentage of some of our businesses that have now been taken outside of the banking market and while we wouldn t say necessarily that that s systemic being not systemic and suggesting that there won t be problems are 2 different things not all nonbanks are situated similarly so there s some healthy thriving well capitalized well and responsibly run companies and there are some others who may not be standing at the end of another downturn so the real question for all of his business that if migrated outside of banks is how much of it will be unable to be rolled over refinanced on the same terms and with the same prices as it is now so it s not about us but it s about understanding that we would want to be able to be there to support and intermediate risk in these markets going forward but for a variety of reasons whether it s structure whether it s capital liquidity pricing that may not be as easy as it sounds in a downturn for portions of that market jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer yes can i just add so just take the big numbers put up growing so obviously regulatory s just keeping an eye on it and we re not particularly worried about it and just to give you some facts the banks there s 2 3 trillion the banks have the generally the senior piece at the a piece about 800 billion or 900 billion then institutional investors some of them are quite bright these are life insurance companies funds etc own the b piece which is about 900 billion and there s 500 million which they call direct now think of these as large funds most of them are large funds some of them are very capable very bright they have long term capital and the institutional piece i mentioned a lot of it is clos and i know that people worried about that but if you actually look at the clos there s more equity in their clos they re more funded and both the direct piece the clo piece is more capital firmer in capital and so this system is ok just getting bigger as more outside of the regulated system and it should be something that should be watched but it s not a systemic issue at this point operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hi good morning i had a question for jamie jamie in the shareholder letter you mentioned because of some significant issues around mortgage that you are intensely reviewing your role in origination servicing and holding mortgages and the odds are increasing that we will need to materially change our mortgage strategy going forward could you give us some color and context for that statement and what kind of things you re thinking about there jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer yes so if you look at the business i mean it is costly you have 3 000 federal and state origination and servicing requirements it is litigious you just look at history you can see that and it s becoming huge nonbanks are becoming competitors and they don t have the same regulation the same requirements on either servicing or production so you re having that issue servicing itself is a hard asset and so we just want to we know it s an important thing for a bank we also want and also you can generalize capital since a lot of banks are constrained by generalized capital it s a capital pot far more than it should be if you look at it relative to the real risk of then holding mortgages so we just want to have our eyes open look at that go through every piece and structure it in a way that we re very happy going forward we don t mind the volatility we don t mind staying in the business but you ve got a look at that and ask a lot of questions about whether banks should even be in it betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst ok and then a separate topic but just a question i wanted to ask because i ve got a couple of questions on it yesterday the whole group of ceos was asked who do you think could succeed you would a woman or would a person of color succeed you and i don t think you raised your hand and just wanted to understand why and just hear from you what why you answered the question that way jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer yes so what i should have said so we don t comment on or speculation on succession plan that s a board level issue it s not something you do in congress where you play your hand out in congress but also i was confused by the question likely without a timetable but we have exceptional women and my successor may very well be a woman but it may not and it really depends on the circumstance at the time and it might different if it s one year from now versus five years from now so that s all that was i think a bunch of people were kind of confused and saying what does the word likely mean and all the stuff like that so i mean it s just blown out of proportion are there several people on the operating committee who can succeed me betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst thanks i appreciate that because that s the answer i expected you were going to give but wanted to hear it from you so appreciate that thanks jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer you re welcome operator your next question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak wolfe research analyst just wanted to follow up on the remarks on the mortgage business we did see a healthy decline in resi mortgage loans and marianne i know you spoke at investor day of the balance sheet optimization strategy which could drive more growth in securities versus loans now i m wondering is that what s really driving the slowdown that we saw on resi loan growth and maybe more broadly how we should think about core loan growth or the sustainable piece of core loan growth in 2019 marianne lake chief financial officer yes so mortgages in 2018 19 are the center of it for mortgage so the market itself is smaller year on year it s about 15 smaller because notwithstanding all of the discussion about lower rates they re still higher year on year than they there were this time last year so that obviously is having an impact and as we ve been and we re down similarly so we ve added about 6 billion of core mortgage loans to our portfolio but against that as you saw last year we did number of loan sales and we did another sale again in the first quarter and that speaks to optimizing the balance sheet we re trying to take loans off of our balance sheet core loans off our balance sheet and sell them if we can reinvest in agency mbs and nonresi assets that have better capital liquidity characteristics so there s going to be it s going to a little bit harder to look at a trend you re going to need to look at things gross so we are originated high quality loans we are adding a number of loans to our portfolio we re distributing based on better execution as that would go but we will continue to optimize our balance sheet steven chubak wolfe research analyst very helpful and just a follow up for me on ccar the federal released a document recently highlighting the changes to the loss models this year including some higher card and auto losses in the upcoming year exam i m just wondering how does that inform the way you re thinking about capital return capacity are you still confident in that sustainability of 75 to 100 net payout as well as the 11 to 12 cet1 target marianne lake chief financial officer yes sorry i didn t hear the second part of the question on losses which losses were up this year that you were mentioning but here s what i would say go steven chubak wolfe research analyst the card and auto losses marianne lake chief financial officer yes so i would i applaud transparency for sure and we love to be able to get more detail as we think about the way that the fed models losses for our portfolios and we ve been observing that over time necessarily it s the case that the federal reserve model is typically less granular and less tied to our specific risks necessarily because they re industrywide net net it doesn t change our point of view that as we re at 12 1 cet1 right now so arguably a little bit above the high end of our range and continuing to grow earnings that we ought to be able to distribute a significant portion of earnings but we ll always invest in our businesses first so we are growing our businesses as responsibly as we can we re adding branches we re adding customers we re adding advisors across our businesses but to the degree that we have excess earnings we ll continue to distribute them and the ranges that we gave you at the end of february nothing s changed operator your next question comes from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst good morning marianne a quick question i know you mentioned that the increase in npls within wholesale was again idiosyncratic but last quarter there was also an increase and it was five credits last quarter is there any way you can give more color as to specific drivers in there and i know you said in the past that you expect it to normalize that you re off a low base i got that but i mean just a little bit of additional color perhaps marianne lake chief financial officer yes so the color is there is really no color which is to say if you were to go back over the course of the last eight quarters and take oil gas energy releases out you would ve seen quarters where reserve builds were close to home and other quarters where they re 100 million and 50 million so there s always been the propensity for there to be one or two or three or four downgrades the thing we look for is whether or not as we look at the portfolio of facilities we have whether we re seeing pressure on corporate margins and free cash flow and whether we re seeing that broadly across the sectors and companies we re banking and we re just not so it s not to say that we aren t playing close attention to real estate given where we are in the cycle it s not to say we aren t paying close attention to retail but the color is there is no real color that these are genuinely a handful of names across a handful of sectors as was true last quarter and even if you look quarter over quarter over quarter that there s no trend to call out and it we have a large wholesale lending portfolio these are extremely modest in the context of that and remember every quarter like we talk about a few because it s non zero but we downgrade and upgrade hundreds of facilities every quarter and it s not just downgrades it s upgrades and they re approximately of equal measure so we re looking very carefully at it we understand why people are questioning and concerned and these are cyclical businesses and the cycle will turn but we re not seeing it yet brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst ok and then a separate question in the mortgage banking it looks like gain on sale margins were at a high point as over the last five years this quarter was that something in the market something with the rates or was there a one off impacting that number this quarter marianne lake chief financial officer so you may recall that we did a mortgage loan sale last quarter and realized and there s geography in the home lending business when we do these mortgage loan sales because we re match funded net net there s very little p l there s last quarter there was a loss in nir and in offset in rate funding in nir this quarter there s a gain so you ve got a loss quarter a gain this quarter both small but nevertheless that s driving the majority of the production margin going up but in addition if you just strip all that noise out which is not material but nevertheless significant quarter over quarter we are seeing better revenue margins on better pricing brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst good morning marianne can you share with us obviously you ve got your de novo branching strategies moving forward and what have you guys discovered and how long does it take for the branches to reach breakeven and then eventually get to your desired return on investment numbers marianne lake chief financial officer yes so we re really really excited to be able to open these branches in these markets and serve more customers across the united states but when you talk about branches you are talking about investment for the long term and when i saw long term multiple years decades so with respect to the new markets that we re entering these are extremely nascent investments the branches in many cases we haven t even broken ground on however that said early indications it s very very early indications are strongly positive we re seeing a lot of excitement in the market we re seeing new accounts in production a little better than we would have expected at this very early stage on the whole you see branches break even over several years and mature in terms of deposit and investments and relationships closer to 10 years or below that gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst very good and then following up on some comments you made at investor day and i believe touched on today about technology spending if i recall correctly next year technology spending should be self funding and stabilized at the level just about where you are today when you compare it to the past five years what has changed with the growth trajectory of technology nominal dollars has now kind of stabilized versus what it was like again in the past five years marianne lake chief financial officer so i just want to reiterate something that i want to make sure you guys completely internalize which is we believe given the level of spend and the continued efficiency we re getting out of each dollar of spend that overall our net investment should be more flat going forward than they had in the past but we will continue to look at every investment on its own merit that said we ve been growing our technology spend and in particular we ve been growing the portion of it that is invested in changing the bank and that runs the gamut from platform modernization and cloud to controls and security and customer experience and digital r d the whole lot it s a large number and each year a lot of that a lot of those dollars that we ve been investing roll off and we get the ability to redecision and reinvest them so this is not that we re going to be doing anything other than continuing to invest very very heavily in the agenda and in particular in the technology agenda it s just that each year the decisions and we ll continue to make the right decisions and we see that being flatter going forward than it has been so we re getting and we re getting more efficient so in the past the way that technology was delivered was very different and the more that we re in our modern virtualized cloud ready way with new technologies each dollar of technology is more productive gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of al alevizakos with hsbc al alevizakos hsbc analyst i ve got a very quick question and a follow up basically my question is on the treasury services year on year the growth going from double digit you just drove to 3 where apparently the volumes remained healthy but the margins started to deteriorate i wonder how you feel going into the remaining of 2019 especially given that the trade talks are still ongoing and therefore volumes could actually be a bit more problematic do you still believe that we can go back to kind of double digit growth year on year for the remaining quarters and my follow up question is you talked about change the bank versus run the bank for it budget can you give us a number just to get the indication of how much you re spending on innovation marianne lake chief financial officer yes ok so first point on treasury services last year our revenue growth was in double digits you re right this quarter we spent year on year i mentioned earlier that for both of our wholesale businesses we happened to have basis compression between the funding spread that we provide to the businesses and pricing declines and so that sort of just given where rates have moved may be a headwind this year as the segment results are reported but for the company it s obviously net zero the more important point is that organic growth underlying all of that balances and payments is holding up very well and we do expect that to continue so you will see margins mainly compress on that it s not speaking to deposit flows it s not speaking to volumes and it s not speaking to escalating payouts at this point so we ve been talking about the underlying organic growth of the business with respect to technology spend you ll recall last year we were kind of 60 40 run the bank change the bank and it s more 50 50 this year so 11 5 billion of spend about half and half but remember in the change the bank it runs the whole gamut from platforms and controls to customer experience digital data r d so it s the whole spectrum operator your next question is from the line of matt o connor with deutsche bank matt o connor deutsche bank analyst good morning i just wanted to follow up on net interest income and it came in a lot better than expected this quarter is there anything that s lumpy or onetime that you d flag because if you annualize it you re already above the full year target at 58 billion plus and obviously there s day count drag this quarter and really just puts and takes with rates and balance sheet growth but it seems like the guidance is conservative versus where you re at right now marianne lake chief financial officer ok so we were slightly better in the first quarter two things driving in one is small but nevertheless is arguably nonrecurring which is we talked about the fact that overall in the company when we do these loan sales that net net there may be a small residual gain or loss that resides in treasury and it was a small gain in the first quarter in nii call it 50 million approximately and then in addition we talked in the fourth quarter about the fact that we were seeing the opportunity to deploy cash in short duration liquid investments that were higher yielding than ioer that continued into the first quarter so we did benefit from that and it may or may not continue but we re not necessarily expecting that to continue all the way through so i would say that day count was a drag as you look forward with some opportunities obviously the risk associated with the flat yield curve not big but nevertheless net neutral to downward pressure or downward pressure if long end rates stay lower for longer as we don t have the tailwind anymore from higher rates and we continue to process the december rate hike you could see more rates paid due little bit more into second quarter so there are risks and opportunities we still think it s a decent outlook but i don t think it s conservative i think it s 58 billion is straight down the middle at this point the trouble with the yield curve is it can fluctuate dramatically over the short term and we shouldn t over interpret it or over chase it at this point i think it s a decent estimate and we ll continue to update you matt o connor deutsche bank analyst ok and then just on the repositioning of the balance sheet and the approach to adding securities are you thinking any differently going forward than maybe you were six weeks ago you clearly seem more positive on the macro and obviously things can change there but are you approaching the balance sheet management a little bit differently given maybe a more positive macro outlook marianne lake chief financial officer well so i mean we only spoke to it most recently about six weeks ago so the sort of overall answer is no not really we expected at that point that we would have a patient fed it turns out that the all the central banks are pointing to being a little bit more dovish which could generally be constructive for the environment and for credit risk on the balance sheet obviously the curve being flatter is not sort of a compelling situation to add more duration but there s natural risk in our balance sheet so overall very little we feel good about credit the curve s flat and we ll continue to manage the overall environment and company as we see the economy unfold matt o connor deutsche bank analyst ok thank you operator our next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning i just wanted to follow up marianne on the comments in the backdrop for lower rates for longer could you give us a sense on how you re thinking about your deposit strategy in retail and wholesale in other words i know you discussed some dynamics on pricing for the first quarter but when do you expect competition to taper off and do banks have room to actually lower deposit cost if the rate curve stays this way for a prolonged period of time marianne lake chief financial officer so i ll just look the big contextual answer will always be the same which is when we think about our strategy around deposits and deposit pricing it is 100 driven by what we re observing in our consumer behaviors and what we re seeing in deposit flows and so that s the environment that we look at to determine what s happening and you ve seen naturally over the course of the last couple of years as rates have been rising that we ve seen flows of deposits to higher yielding alternatives whether it s investments or whether it s more recently in cds and that may continue we ll continue to watch that it is our expectation that rates will be relatively stable from here in terms of the short end and it s the short end that predominantly drives the deposit pricing agenda so even if the curve is flatter as long as it s because the front end is stable i don t necessarily see deposit costs going down but we re going to continue to watch our customer behaviors and deposit flows and respond accordingly erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you and my follow up question is we heard you loud and clear during your prepared remarks that the increase in wholesale nonaccruals was idiosyncratic and i m wondering as we look at a tick up in nonaccrual loans in the corporate investment bank for the past two quarters are we just in the part of the cycle where we re just growing from a low base or should we expect a step down in the second quarter in nonaccruals similar to how we saw last year marianne lake chief financial officer there are a couple of situations that we would expect to maybe not be present in the second quarter but i would say it s a feature more of the extremely low base and so from that any movement whether up or down is somewhat exaggerated but we would continue to call the credit environment benign erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin jefferies analyst thanks marianne just if i could ask you you mentioned you had some signs that the economy is strengthening and i wanted to just ask you to can you split that between just what you re seeing on the consumer side versus the wholesale corporate side in terms of the spend numbers are obviously still double digit year over year some others have talked about a little bit of a slowdown yours are still staying quite good and then there s this unevenness about just capex and spending and corporate side so just where are you could you just kind of walk us through just where you re seeing pockets of relative strength and improvement marianne lake chief financial officer yes i mean i think that as it relates to the u s and in particular looking at the u s consumer you ve got all up jobs more recently auto housing spend all generally encouraging and holding up well and robust and whether it s double digits or whether it s not we re continuing to see the and consumer confidence by the way which is still very high and has recovered from any sort of hangover from the equity market actions over the fourth quarter so for us u s consumer has always been strong and confident and even if we re not at an all time highs in confidence it s still very high and generally the beta is and even some like housing and auto that hasn t necessarily been super strong is looking encouraging and then on the global front it is a little harder but as you look at some of the areas that have been struggling a bit and europe would be a good example we would think that in the first quarter sort of transitory factors around social unrest and politics and brexit and they seem to be fading a little business confidence has recovered a little businesses are still spending on labor so generally a good sign of underlying confidence notwithstanding any kind of sentiment numbers and even there there s job growth there s wage growth that s helped by dovish monetary policy and general financial conditions having improved the least so i mean i think generally we feel optimistic across the consumer and the rest of the sector albeit it s sort of green shoots on the wholesale buy so it s early but it s what we were expecting to see and so long may it continue ken usdin jefferies analyst yes and one follow up just on the investment banking business you had mentioned that the pipelines look good and obviously we ve seen the reopening of the ecm market what s your general outlook just again on that global point about the a bit of unevenness between u s and global just how do you feel about the advisory backdrop and obviously some big deals on the tape again today but had there been a little bit of an air pocket here partially probably because of the soft fourth quarter but how s that side of the business feeling and sounding from a backlog perspective marianne lake chief financial officer yes so i would say that a couple of things obviously there were some deals that moved into the first quarter out of the second half of 2018 and so we did benefit from that but just as a general market matter m a is still attractive in a low growth environment albeit a growth environment in fact it is still constructive north america which is by far the biggest market for m a is still healthy and so europe was a big driver last year and europe has been a sharp drop off in volumes and wallet and so that may continue although we have a pretty good position there so i would say that the pipeline is down but still m a is attractive and people are looking for synergistic growth ken usdin jefferies analyst that makes sense thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with buckingham research jim mitchell buckingham research analyst hey good morning maybe just a follow up on the nii outlook i mean i think we ve talked about a flat curve what kind of levers do you have to pull if we were to see what some are speculating it doesn t sound like you re in that camp but if we were to get a rate cut how do you manage that how do you think the balance sheet reacts and nii reacts to potential for a rate cut over the next 12 months marianne lake chief financial officer right so the market which is usually more i wouldn t say pessimistic but more in that camp they are still only expecting an ease at the end of the year so we are not by the way as you point out so i think for 2019 s nii outlook it s not a clear and present danger that there will be an ease obviously we have on the way up on rates been overindexed to total end rates and so clearly if we were to have a ease it would have an impact on our nii if we felt generally that that was the direction that the economy and rates were going in then it might change our view on how we position the balance sheet but right now the fed is on course right now that s constructive to corporate deposit margins constructive for credit and generally constructive for how we re positioned on the balance sheet jim mitchell buckingham research analyst but you feel like you have room to i guess extend duration to kind of protect nii and nim if that were to happen marianne lake chief financial officer yes yes we do jim mitchell buckingham research analyst ok all right thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of saul martinez with ubs saul martinez ubs analyst hi good morning i wanted to follow up on matt s question on sort of idiosyncratic items in the quarter and lumpiness this is obviously a pretty strong quarter from an earnings standpoint earnings well ahead of my estimates and consensus and especially in ccb but there weren t a lot of obvious noncore items really called out so marianne can you just comment on the sustainability of the results and whether there s some idiosyncratic things that weren t necessarily called out during the call you mentioned corporate cash deployment revenues really high relative to historical levels there so are there any sort of idiosyncratic items that call into question how sustainable the results are marianne lake chief financial officer so first of all just sort of big picture really high i think is a bit of an overstatement higher up i think is fair no not really if there were we would have called them out there are a few little things so i m just going to call out a few of the things that we have mentioned we contributed 100 million to a foundation this quarter net net legal was a very very small but nevertheless positive this quarter so there were a few little bits and pieces like that but if you look at revenue performance we did a little better across the board than you all were expecting we did better in ib fees and we ve gained a lot of share we did a little better in markets we did a little better in nii so just a little bit of a wind at our backs sort of phenomenon probably my best answer to you is as happy as we are with performance and we are gaining share and continuing to see our underlying drivers propel us forward and the momentum we ve got in our businesses we are not making material changes to our full year outlook so we ll still see how market performs for the year we do still expect as daniel mentioned at investor day that while we feel great about our positioning in investment banking in the first quarter coalition is still expecting the wallet to be down between 5 and 10 year on year so we do expect to gain share to help offset that but last year was a record so we haven t changed our full year guidance at all yet we ll take a sort of very good downpayment for that and if markets are constructive and wallet expands we ll benefit from that but we re not leading it across and changing everything saul martinez ubs analyst that s helpful i ll change gears a little bit any update on distressed capital buffer what the fed is thinking there and when you think we could see a little bit more details or a little bit more clarity on the proposal marianne lake chief financial officer so as best i know there is a chance but not necessarily a probability that there could be an scb proposal for 2020 ccar so there a meet a set of meetings or a meeting that s coming up some time in the summer that i think might be an important moment but we continue to work as constructively as we can to help understand in a better way to bridge growth capital together with point in time capital but it s complicated so as we said the most important thing is not to issue an scb proposal that doesn t deal with the entire landscape of capital and look at it cohesively so we re talking about gsib we re talking about minimums we re talking about basel we re talking about scb it s complicated i d say there s a chance but not a probability that we might have something in time for 2020 ccar saul martinez ubs analyst got it thanks a lot operator your next question comes from the line of marty mosby with vining sparks marty mosby vining sparks analyst thanks for taking the question hey good morning first i want to ask is going to ccar now we re getting into that season again one of the things that i think has an impact is that what we had was a significant 30 plus growth in earnings last year so if you kind of look at the plan for your capital going forward and you think of holding payout ratios so let s say they were just constant doesn t that kind of presume that you have kind of some wind behind the sails just to increase fairly significant just off the increase in earnings last year marianne lake chief financial officer i mean yes if you look at payout ratios obviously sort of described as a percentage then we said over the longer term we d expect to pay out in a benign environment between 75 and 100 and analysts have estimates of 90 plus and obviously as earnings grow that would be a bigger dollar number but again we ll always calibrate that relative to our opportunity to invest in our businesses and its capacity not a promise so we ll continue to see how the whole environment unfolds but you re right as earnings continue to grow a strong payout ratio we re above our the top end of our capital range so we are starting at a robust level would be a higher dollar number yes marty mosby vining sparks analyst and then jamie i was just curious i think one of the issues facing the industry and just that we get pushed from the outside is that the cycle is 10 years old and my thought is that that internal time clock is just off this time and so if we look at it i think there s things that you re seeing or marianne that you see inside the company that probably dispel that the recession is kind of on the horizon so just wanted to get your comment on that as well is my follow up question marianne lake chief financial officer yes so i do quite sorry go jamie jamie dimon chairman and chief executive officer yes some sort of number that s out that australia has had a growth for 28 years and just off saying the notional but do you have to have a recession they ve had a lot of back wind there s growth in asia and stuff like that but if you look at the american economy the consumer s in good shape the balance sheet s in good shape people are going back to the workforce companies have plenty of capital and capital spending in truth is still up year over year a little bit less this quarter than last quarter capital is being retained in the united states business confidence and consumer confidence are both rather high not at all time peaks rather high so you can just easily it could go on for years there s no law that says it has to stop we do make risks and look at all the other things geopolitical issues lower liquidity so there may be a confluence of events that somehow causes a recession but it may not be in 2019 2020 2021 obviously at one point though it ll probably there will be something and yes i think the bigger short term risk would be something to go wrong with china the trade issue with china so i just wouldn t count on there having to be a recession in the short run the next couple of years marty mosby vining sparks analyst i agree operator question comes from the line of andrew lim with societe generale andrew lim societe generale analyst hi morning thanks for taking my questions so my first question is on the end of period loans so if we look across the board it looks like there s some contraction therewith the quarter to quarter basis of about 3 of 4 so i was just wondering if you saw that as a 1 quarter issue relating to what happened in 4q 18 and if you can give some color maybe on the quarters ahead speaking to companies here is whether you see growth trend emerging again marianne lake chief financial officer yes so quarter on quarter and i think i mentioned a couple of these things but we across our businesses for a variety of reasons on an end of period basis loans are down so like stepping through them the first one that i would point out is mortgage and we just talked about that i think earlier in the call which is we continue to originate mortgage loans we continue to just really expand the portfolio but we did do a loan sale which is part of the discussion that we ve been having with you about optimizing our balance sheet we did a sale at the end of the quarter so that s impacting our mortgage loans and the cib and one of the reasons why we called out core loan growth ex the cib is that because we don t consider cib loans as core because they are just by their nature oftentimes more episodic and lumpy and so we did see a large funded syndicated loan at the end of last quarter which was fully syndicated into the first quarter and then in our other businesses in asset wealth management a bit of seasonality a few pay downs in card seasonality so it s a combination of factors but obviously two drivers cib and home lending cib on sort of that large syndication home lending on the loan sale going forward we ll continue to optimize the loan versus security part of our balance sheet as best we can for cash and liquidity purposes but just underlying core business demand for bank balance sheet lending i look at the middle market space and say we re still seeing solid demand it is in our investment areas and our expansion markets and specialized industries but we re still growing that portion of our loans in the mid single digits year on year i m sorry andrew there are going to be other areas where we just won t throttle up i mean in commercial real estate you see loan growth is much lower it s very competitive spreads have come down we continue to provide financing and funding for our core loans but we re not going to chase it down and similarly auto andrew lim societe generale analyst ok thanks so much so my follow on question is on clos so japanese institutions are big buyers of u s highly rated clos but a few weeks ago the japanese fsa introduced some new rules saying that there had to be 5 risk retention by u s issuers in order for the japanese institutions to buy them so i m just wondering if you re seeing yet any change in demand from japanese institutions and likewise on the other side if there s any change in behavior from u s clo issuers in terms of trying to integrate 5 risk retention marianne lake chief financial officer so that is a great question the answer i m going to give you is not that i m aware of at this point but i ll have to follow up with you jamie are you aware no sorry andrew we ll come back to you not that i m aware of but that it s a good but nevertheless quite detailed question andrew lim societe generale analyst ok thanks operator and there are no further questions at this time marianne lake chief financial officer thanks everyone operator duration 67 minutes call participants marianne lake

operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chase s first quarter 2019 earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation please stand by at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chase s chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer marianne lake ms lake please go ahead marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator good morning everybody i m going to take you through the earnings presentation which is available on our website please refer to the disclaimer at the back of the presentation starting on page 1 the firm reported record net income of 9 2 billion an eps of 2 65 on record revenue of nearly 30 billion with a return on tangible common equity of 19 the results this quarter were strong and broad based highlights include core loan growth ex cib of 5 with loan trends continuing to progress as expected credit performance remained strong across businesses we saw record client investment assets in consumer of over 300 billion and record new money flows this quarter and double digit growth in both card sales and merchant processing volumes up 10 and 13 respectively inaudible number one in global ib fees and gained meaningful share with share well above 9 this quarter in the commercial bank we had record gross ib revenue in asset wealth management record aum and client assets and the firm delivered another quarter of strong positive operating leverage turning to page 2 and talking into more detail about the first quarter revenue of 29 9 billion was up 1 3 billion or 5 year on year driven by net interest income which was up 1 1 billion or 8 on higher rates as well as balance sheet growth and mix non interest revenue was up slightly as reported but excluding fair value gains on the implementation of a new accounting standard last year nii would have been up 5 reflecting auto lease growth and strong investment banking fees and while markets revenue was lower there were other items more than offsetting expense of 16 4 billion was up 2 relating to continued investments we re making in technology real estate marketing and front office partially offset by a reduction in fdic charges of a little over 200 million credit remains favorable across both consumer and wholesale credit costs of 1 5 billion were up 330 million year on year driven by changes in wholesale reserves in consumer charge offs were in line with expectations and there were no changes to reserve this quarter in wholesale we had about 180 million of credit costs driven by reserve builds on select c i client downgrades and recall that there was a net release last year related to energy once again these downgrades were idiosyncratic it was a handful of names and across sectors net reserve builds to this order of magnitude are extremely modest given the size of our portfolios and we are not seeing signs of deterioration moving on to page 3 and balance sheet and capital we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of 12 1 up modestly from last quarter with the benefit of strong earnings and aoci gains given rallying rates being partially offset by slightly higher risk weighted assets rwa is up primarily due to higher counterparty credit on trading activity but most of these this quarter being offset by lower loans across businesses on a spot basis quarter on quarter loans were down in home lending as a result of a loan sale transaction and the cib as a result of the large syndication and in card and asset wealth management seasonally also on the page total assets are up over 100 billion quarter on quarter principally driven by higher cib trading assets in part a normalization from lower levels at the end of the year given market conditions lower end of period loans are partially offset by treasury balances including higher securities in the quarter the firm distributed 7 4 billion of capital to shareholders including 4 7 billion of share repurchases inaudible we submitted our 2019 ccar capital plans to the federal reserve moving to consumer community banking on page 4 ccb generated net income of 4 billion and an roe of 30 with consumers remaining strong and confident core loans were up 4 here year on year driven by home lending and cards both up 6 and business banking up 3 deposits grew 3 in line with our expectations and we believe we continue to outperform client investment assets were up 13 driven by record new money flows reflecting growth across physical and digital channels including you invest we also announced plans to open 90 branches this year in new markets revenue of 13 8 billion was up 9 consumer business banking revenue up 15 on higher deposit nii driven by continued margin expansion home lending revenue was down 11 driven by net servicing revenue on both lower operating revenue and msr but notably while volumes are down production revenue is up nicely year on year on disciplined pricing and cards merchant services and auto revenues was up 9 driven by higher card nii on loan growth and margin expansion and higher auto lease volumes expense of 7 2 billion was up 4 driven by investments in the business and auto lease depreciation partly offset by expense efficiencies and lower fdic charges on credit net charge offs were flat as lower charge offs in home lending and auto were offset by higher charge offs in card on loan growth charge off rates were down year on year across lending portfolios now turning to page 5 and the corporate investment bank cib reported net income of 3 3 billion and an roe of 16 on strong revenue performance of nearly 10 billion for the quarter ib revenue of 1 7 billion was up 10 year on year and outside of an accounting nuance all of advisory dcm and total ib fees would have been record for a first quarter advisory fees were up 12 in a market that was down benefiting from a number of large deals closing this quarter we ranked number one in announced dollar volumes and gained nearly 100 basis points of wallet share debt underwriting fees were up 21 also outperforming a market that was down driven by large acquisition financing deals and our continued strong lead left positions in leverage finance we maintained our number one rank and gained well over 100 basis points of share and equity underwriting fees were down 23 but in a market down more as the combination of the government shutdown uncertainty around brexit and the digital ph impacts from the december volatility weighed on issuance activity across the regions in the first quarter but already in the second quarter we ve seen a major recovery in us ipo volumes back to normalized levels and we are benefiting from our leadership in the technology and healthcare sectors which again dominate the calendar moving to markets total revenue was 5 5 billion down 17 reported or down 10 adjusted for the impact of the accounting standard last year that i referred to big picture on a year on year basis we are challenged by a tough comparison backdrop in the first quarter of 2018 was supportive clients were active and we saw broad based strength in performance with a clear record in equities last year in contrast this quarter started relatively slowly and overhanging uncertainties kept clients on the sidelines despite a recovered and more stable environment so with that in mind i would categorize the results as solid and a little better than we thought at investor day just a few weeks ago largely due to a better second half of march and for what it s worth so far the environment in april feels generally constructive but it s too early to draw any conclusions in terms of p l fixed income markets revenue was down 8 adjusted driven by lower activity particularly in rates and in currencies and emerging markets which normalized following a strong prior year however we did see relative strengths in credit trading on strong flows as well as in commodities equities revenue was down 13 adjusted speaking more to the record prior year quarter inaudible performance which was still generally strong across products although derivatives got off to a somewhat slower start cash in particular nearly matched last year s exceptional results treasury services revenue was 1 1 billion up 3 year on year benefiting from higher balances and payments volume being partially offset by deposit margin compression securities services revenue was 1 billion down 4 as organic growth was more than offset by fee and deposit margin compression lower market levels and the impact of a business exit of note deposit margin in both treasury services and securities services is impacted by funding basis compression rather than client basis and at the firmwide level there s an offset finally expense of 5 5 billion was down 4 driven by lower performance based compensation and lower fdic charges partially offset by continued investments in the business the cost to revenue ratio for the quarter was 30 moving to commercial banking on page 6 a strong quarter for the commercial bank with net income of 1 1 billion and an roe of 19 revenue of 2 3 billion was up 8 year on year on strong investment banking performance and higher deposit nii record gross ib revenue of over 800 million was up more than 40 year on year due to several large transactions and the pipeline continues to feel robust and active deposit balances were down 5 year on year and 1 sequentially as migration of non operating deposits to higher yielding alternatives have decelerated and we believe is largely behind us from here we expect deposits to stabilize given the benign rate outlook expense of 873 million was up 3 year on year as we continue to invest in the business in banker coverage and in technology loans were up 2 year on year and flat sequentially c i loans were up 2 or up 5 adjusted for the continued runoff in our tax exempt portfolio we continue to see solid growth across expansion markets and specialized industries cre loans were up 1 as competition remains elevated and we continue to maintain discipline given where we are in the cycle finally credit costs of 90 million were predominantly driven by higher reserves from select client downgrades and net charge offs were only 2 basis points on strong underlying performance before we move on i want to address the perceived gap between our reported c i growth statistics and those that we will see in the fed weekly data if we look across all of our wholesale businesses we also show strong growth year on year at about 8 but there are three comments i would make the first is that there can be reasonable noise in the fed weekly data second cib is a big contributor for us and cib loan growth this quarter was supported by robust acquisition financing and higher market loans and third as previously noted the definition of c i for the fed does not include our tax exempt portfolio which has seen significant year on year declines given tax reform so while it s true that the fed data is showing strong growth year on year and apples to apples inaudible mainstream middle market lending space we re seeing good mid single digit demand in line with our expectations moving on to asset wealth management on page 7 asset wealth management reported net income of 661 million with a pre tax margin of 24 and an roe of 25 revenue of 3 5 billion for the quarter was flat year on year as lower management fees on average market levels as well as lower brokerage activity were offset by higher investment valuation gains expense of 2 6 billion was up 3 year on year as continued investments in our business as well as other headcount related expenses were partially offset by lower external fees for the quarter we saw net long term inflows of 10 billion with strength in fixed income partially offset by outflows from other asset classes additionally we had net liquidity outflows of 5 billion aum of 2 1 trillion and overall client assets of 2 9 trillion were both record up 4 driven by cumulative net inflows in the liquidity and long term products and with first quarter market performance nearly offsetting fourth quarter declines deposits were up 4 sequentially on seasonality and down 4 year on year reflecting continued migration into investments although decelerating as we continue to capture the vast majority of these flows finally we had record loan balances up 10 with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending moving to page 8 and corporate corporate reported net income of 251 million with net revenue of 425 million compared to a net loss of over 200 million last year the improvement was driven by higher nii on higher rates as well as cash deployment opportunities in treasury and recall last year we had nearly 250 million of net losses on security sales relative to a small net gain this quarter expense of 211 million is up year on year and includes a contribution to the foundation of 100 million this quarter completing on page 9 to wrap up this is inaudible that really showcases the strength of the firm s operating model benefiting from diversification and scale and our consistent investment agenda we delivered record revenue and net income and a clean first quarter performance despite some hangover from the fourth quarter underlying drivers across our businesses continue to propel us forward and in march and coming into april the economic backdrop feels increasingly constructive client sentiment has recovered and recent global data shows encouraging momentum investor day is only six weeks behind us so our guidance for the full year hasn t changed we do remain well positioned and optimistic about the firm s performance with that operator we ll take questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous john mcdonald bernstein analyst hi good morning marianne you had good expense control this quarter and your jamie s letter you show goals of improving the efficiency ratio in each of the main business units for the next few years just kind of wondering what s driving that is there any kind of cresting of investment spend that s going to occur in 2020 or is this kind of positive operating leverage carrying through marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah hey john so i would say just big picture it s a combination of both obviously we talked at investor day about the fact that we re always going to make the net investment the net incremental investment decision based on its own merit but in total with the amount we re spending now and the amount of dollars that roll off every year that get repositioned for investments we feel like we should see our net investment spend reach a reasonable plateau over the course of the next several years and so that is obviously a lot of the investments that we ve been making in technology are also not only to do with customer service and risk management and revenue generation but they are also to do with operating efficiency so we do would also expect to start to see some of that drive operating leverage but it s also in the case that we re looking for revenue growth too so it s a combination of both john mcdonald bernstein analyst okay and then just on the nii outlook it s reassuring to be able to hold the investor day outlook of 58 billion for this year even though the curve s flattened there were some concerns there what are the dynamics that enable you to keep the guidance even with the change in curve that we ve seen marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so i mean the first thing i would say is that we ve said this before and we ve seen these periods where you get kind of short term fluctuations in the curve is that it s a bit dangerous to chase it up and down every month or so and so in the big picture we said 58 billion plus yes it s true that a persistent flatter curve would have us more net drag on carry and we re not immune to that so there is a little bit of pressure as a result of that if it is persistent at this level throughout the year but we continue to grow our loans and our deposits and against that there s a mixed bag of lower for longer so while we may not have a tailwind of higher rates we also may not have the same kinds of pressures that we would see on bases necessarily and while lower long end rates may be a net small drag in the short term on earnings there s the credit on the balance sheet and you could argue a patient fed and lower rates for longer may elongate the cycle so net net there are pluses and minuses i would say there may be some pressure as a result of that as it s persistent but it s modest operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo wells fargo analyst hi you mentioned consumer deposit growth is outperforming where you get average consumer deposits up over 20 billion year over year so those are the numbers i was hoping for a little bit more on the why and to what degree does that reflect your build out of branches how is that deposit growth growing how much of this is related to digital banking and then how much would be due to simply a perception that you have superior strength i know that came up during the ceo hearings the imf study saying that you get a benefit due to a perception of being too big to fail thanks marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so look i would say there s lots of different opportunity for people to get insured deposit so come back to the third point but all of that plays a piece so you ll recall that we ve built a large number of branches following the financial crisis as we densified our position in new markets in california and florida and nevada and the like and so we do have a decent portion of our branches that are still in their maturation phase and so we re definitely seeing some growth in deposits there i also firmly believe and we ve talked about it many many times that we ve been investing consistently over the last decade in customer experience customer satisfaction in our consumer banking is at an all time high and continues to increase consecutively digital products new products and services value propositions to our customers convenience new markets all of which i think are increasingly important to our customers as well as obviously a number of other factors so to me it s a combination of all of the above and less so at this point a perception of flight to quality the people have a lot of choices year over year i would say we re seeing deposit growth slow exactly in line with our expectations but this year the slowdown speaks a little bit more as far as we can see to higher consumer spend and a little bit less to do with deposit flows out to rate seeking alternatives so customers are voting with their business they re bringing deposits to us and i think it speaks to a combination of the investments we re making and also including branches mike mayo wells fargo analyst so how much of the deposit growth is due to digital banking can you quantify that or give us a ballpark figure marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer well i can tell you that i m sorry it s not just deposit growth as far as i remember it s also about investment assets and we talked about our digital offerings providing headwinds there so i don t have a breakout for you we can follow up it s decent but our branch growth the reason why we continue to believe in a physical and digital combined channel presence both are important but we can get back to you operator the next question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi glenn schorr evercore isi analyst hi thanks very much on sec services i heard you loud and clear about the funding basis compression being part of the answer on revs down could you talk about the business exit i wasn t aware of that how big that is and then flip to the better side you also did mention about organic growth we haven t heard too much since the big trillion dollar win but i know there is stuff going on underneath the covers talk about what type of business you are winning there marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yes so on the business exit this is it s the sort of feature of always talking about year over year to me this feels like really old news it was a us broker dealer exit that we talked about many quarters ago but obviously we re still on a year over year basis for another couple of quarters going to see the impact of that on our revenues it s about just over 20 million year on year revenue negative impact but it s relatively speaking old news in terms of the exit took place last year lower market levels were about an equivalent drag on revenues and then we are seeing solid underlying growth but this is a very competitive environment and as we are growing our custody assets and as we re growing and winning new mandates fees are under competitive pressures and it also depends on mix so there s a bunch of factors going on what we are focused on is for both of these businesses that the long term growth opportunities are very big and the organic growth and the underlying businesses are performing well and even with these revenue pressures we re focused on continuing to drive efficiencies and these are good roe businesses above mid teens glenn schorr evercore isi analyst appreciate marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer i m sorry i ll just make one more comment mike i didn t say this on the digital space but i think it s important as we think going forward that as we think not just about our digital assets but digital account opening and that has been a feature of how we are attracting new account 25 of checking production 40 of savings production now able to be open digitally so increasingly digital will be a driver but we will get back to you with the mix all right glenn schorr evercore isi analyst marianne just one quick qualifier on the seven hour marathon the other day in dc besides finding out jamie is a capitalist that s shocking news one of risks that i think that the group talked about was in the private credit markets and non bank lending and i just wanted to marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah glenn schorr evercore isi analyst get a little qualifier of that i m pretty sure you didn t mean the exposure jpmorgan has to those it s just more risk being taken but if you can just expand on that that would be helpful marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so for sure the comment is more about the overall risk in the environment and not about our risks to those sectors and our risks are that all the things that we ve always told you about which are relatively modest relatively senior well secured well diversified we look at losses under a variety of such scenarios are manageable the comments are really about the percentage of leverage lending or the percentage of some of our businesses that have now been taken outside of the banking market and while we wouldn t say necessarily that s systemic being not systemic and suggesting that there won t be problems are two different things not all non banks are situated similarly so there are some healthy fighting well capitalized well and responsibly run companies and there are some others who may not be standing at the end of another downturn so the real question for all of this business that is migrated outside of banks is how much of it will be unable to be rolled over refinanced on the same terms and with the same prices as it is now so it s not about us but it s about understanding that we would want to be able to be there to support and intermediate within these markets going forward but for a variety of reasons whether it s structured whether it s capital liquidity pricing that may not be as easy as it sounds in a downturn for portions of that market jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer yeah can i just take the big numbers put on rolling so obviously regulators keep an eye on it and we re not particularly worried about it just to give you some facts the banks there s a 2 3 trillion the banks have generally the senior piece the a piece of about 800 billion or 900 billion then institutional investors some of them are quite right these are life insurance companies funds etcetera owned bps about 900 billion and there s 500 billion what they call direct and think of these as large funds for the most part large funds some are very capable very bright they have long term capital in the institutional piece that i mentioned a lot of them are clos and i know that people are worried about that but if you actually look at the clos they are more equity in those clos they are more funded and both the direct piece and the clo piece is more capital permanent capital so this system is ok it s just getting bigger as more outside regulated sentiment it should be something that should be watched but it s not a systemic issue at this point operator the next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hi good morning marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer good morning betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst i had a question for jamie jamie in the shareholder letter you mentioned because of some significant issues around mortgage that you are intensely reviewing your role in origination servicing and holding mortgages and the odds are increasing that we will need to materially change our mortgage strategy going forward could you give us some color and context for that statement and what kind of things you re thinking about there jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer yeah so if you look at the business i mean it is just costly you have 3 000 federal and state origination and servicing requirements it is litigious you just look at history you can see that and it s becoming a huge non banks are becoming competitors and they don t have the same regulations the same requirements in the servicing or production so you re having that issue of servicing itself is a hard asset and so we just want to we know it s an important thing for a bank we also want and also we standardize capital since lot of banks are constrained by generalized capital it s just a capital pod far more than it should be if you look at it relative to the real risk embedded in holding mortgages so we just want to have our eyes open look at that go through every piece and structure it in a way that we re very happy going forward we don t mind the volatility we don t mind staying in the business you got to look at that and ask a lot of questions about whether banks should even be in it betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst okay and then separate topic but just a question i wanted to ask because i got a couple of questions on it yesterday the whole group of ceos was asked who do you think could succeed you would a woman or would a person of color succeed you and i don t think you raised your hand and just wanted to understand why and just hear from you why you answered the question that way jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer yeah so what i should have said is that we don t comment on or speculation on succession plan that s a board level issue it s not something you do in congress where you play your hand out in congress but also i was confused by a question likely without a timetable so we have exceptional women and my succession may very well be a woman and it may not and it really depends on the circumstance of the time and it might be different if it s one year from now versus five years from now so that s all of that was i think a bunch of people were kind of confused and saying what you would likely mean was stuff like that so i inaudible several people on the operating committee who can succeed me betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst thanks i appreciate that that s the answer i expected you we re going to give we wanted to hear from you so appreciate that thanks jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer you re welcome operator your next question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak wolfe research analyst hi i just wanted to follow up on the remarks on the mortgage business we did see a healthy decline in resi mortgage loans and marianne i know you spoke at investor day of the balance sheet optimization strategy which could drive more growth in securities versus loans i m wondering if that what s really driving the slowdown that we saw in resi loan growth and maybe more broadly how we should think about core loan growth or a sustainable pace of core loan growth in 2019 marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so mortgages in 2018 2019 are the epicenter of the mortgage so the market itself is more year on year it s about 15 smaller because notwithstanding all of the discussion about lower rates are still higher year on year than they were this time last year so that obviously is having an impact and as we ve been and we re down similarly so we ve added about 6 billion of core mortgage loans to our portfolio but against that as you saw last year we did a number of loan sales and a number of loan sales and we did another sale again in the first quarter and that speaks to optimizing the balance sheet we re trying to take loans off of our balance sheet core loans of our balance sheet and sell them if we can reinvest in agency mbs and non resi assets that has better capital liquidity characteristics so it s going to be a little bit harder to look at the trend you re going to need to look at things grow so we are originating high quality loans we are adding a number of loans to our portfolio we re distributing based on better execution as that would go but we will continue to optimize our balance sheet steven chubak wolfe research analyst very helpful and just a follow up for me on ccar the fed released a document recently highlighting the changes to the loss models this year including some higher card and auto losses in the upcoming exam i m just wondering how does that inform the way you re thinking about capital return capacity and are you still confident in that sustainability of 75 to 100 net payout as well as the 11 to 12 cet1 target marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so i didn t hear the second part of the question on losses which losses were up this year that you were mentioning but here is what i would say steven chubak wolfe research analyst the card and auto losses marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so i applaud transparency for sure and we love to be able to get more detail as we think about the way that the fed model losses for our portfolios and we ve been observing that over time necessarily it s the case that the federal reserve models are typically less granular and less tied to our specific risks necessarily because they are industry wide net net it doesn t change our point of view that as we re at 12 1 cet1 right now so arguably little bit above the high end of our range and continuing to grow earnings that we ought to be able to distribute a significant portion of earnings but we always invest in our businesses first so we are growing our businesses responsibly every time we re adding branches we re adding customers we re adding advisors across our businesses but to the degree that we have excess earnings we ll continue to distribute them and the ranges that we gave you at the end of february nothing changed operator next question comes from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst hi good morning marianne quick question i know you mentioned that the increase in npls within wholesale was again idiosyncratic but last quarter there was also an increase and it was five credits last quarter is there a way you can give more color as to specific drivers in there i know you said in the past that you expect to normalize that you re off a low base i got that but i mean just a little bit of additional color perhaps marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so the color is there is really no color which is to say if you were to go back over the course of the last eight quarters and take oil gas energy releases out you would ve seen quarters where reserve builds were close to home and other quarters where there are 100 million inaudible so there s always been the propensity for there to be one or two or three or four downgrades the thing we look for is whether or not as we look at the portfolio of facilities we have whether we re seeing pressure on corporate margins and free cash flow and whether we re seeing that broadly across the sectors and companies we re banking in and we re just not so it s not to say that we aren t playing close attention to real estate given where we are in the cycle it s not to say we re playing close attention to retail but the color is there is no real color that these are genuinely a handful of names across a handful of sectors as was true last quarter and even if you look quarter over quarter over quarter there s no trend to call out and we have a large wholesale lending portfolio these are extremely modest in the context of that and remember every quarter like we talk about a few because it s non zero but we downgrade and upgrade hundreds of facilities every quarter and it s not just downgrades it s upgrades and they re approximately of equal measure so we re looking very carefully i think we understand why people are questioning concerned and these are cyclical businesses and the cycle return but we re not seeing it yet brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst okay and then a separate question in the mortgage banking it looks like gain on sale margins were at a high point over the last five years this quarter was that something in the market something with the rates or was there a one off impacting that number this quarter marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer so you may recall that we did a mortgage loan sale last quarter and realized and there s geography in the home lending business when we do these mortgage loan sales because we re match funded net net there s very little p l but last quarter there was a loss in nir and an offset in rate funding in nir this quarter there s a gain so you ve got a loss quarter gain this quarter both small but nevertheless that s driving the majority of the production margin going up but in addition if you just strip all that noise out which is not material but nevertheless significant quarter over quarter we are seeing better revenue margins on better pricing brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst okay great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst good morning marianne marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer good morning gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst can you share with us obviously you ve got your de novo branching strategy moving forward and what have you guys discovered and how long does it take for the branches to reach breakeven and then eventually get to your desired return on investment numbers marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so we re really really excited to be able to open these branches in these markets and serve more customers across the united states but when you talk about branches you are talking about investment for the long term and when i say long term multiple years decades so with respect to the new markets that we re entering these are extremely nascent investments the branches in many cases we haven t even broken ground on however that said early indication these very very early indications are strongly positive we re seeing a lot of excitement in the market we re seeing new accounts in production a little better than we would have expected at this very early stage on the whole you see branches break even over several years and mature in terms of deposit and investments and relationships closer to 10 years or below that gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst very good and then following up on some comments you made at investor day and i believe touched on today about technology spending if i recall correctly next year technology spending should be self funding and stabilized at just about where you are today when you compare it to the past five years what has changed with the growth trajectory of technology nominal dollars has now kind of stabilized versus what it was like again in the past five years marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer so i just want to reiterate something that i want to make sure you guys completely internalize which is we believe given the level of spend and the continued efficiency we re getting out of each dollar of spend that overall our net investment should be more flat going forward than they have in the past but we will continue to look at every investment on its own merit that said we ve been growing our technology spend and in particular we ve been growing the portion of it that is invested in changing the bank and that runs the gamut from platform modernization and cloud to controls and security and customer experience and digital r d and the whole lot it s a large number and each year a lot of the dollars that we ve been investing roll off and we get the ability to redecision and reinvest them so this is not that we re going to be doing anything other than continuing to invest very very heavily in the agenda and in particular in the technology agenda it s just that each year technical difficulty and we ll continue to make the right decisions and we see that being flatter going forward than it has been gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst thank you marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer and we re getting more efficient so in the past the way the technology was delivered was very different and the more that we re in our modern virtualized cloud ready way with new technology each dollar of technology is more productive gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of al alevizakos with hsbc alevizos alevizakos hsbc analyst hi i ve got a quick question and a follow up basically my question is on the treasury services year on year the growth going from double digit you just grow to 3 where apparently the volumes remained healthy but the margins started to deteriorate i wonder how you feel going into the remaining of 2019 especially given that the trade talks are still ongoing and therefore volumes could actually be a bit more problematic do you still believe that we can go back to kind of double digit growth year on year for the remaining quarters and my follow up question is we talked about change the bank versus run the bank for it budget can you give us a number just to get the indication of how much you re spending on innovation thank you marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yes okay so first point on treasury services obviously revenue growth was in double digits you re right this quarter inaudible year on year i mentioned earlier that for both of our wholesale businesses we happen to have basis compression between the funding spreads that we provide to the businesses and pricing declines and so that just given where rates have moved headwind this year as the segment results are reported but for the company it s obviously net zero the more important point is that organic growth underlying all of that balances and payments is holding up very well and we do expect that to continue so you will see margins really compressed on that it s not speaking to deposit flows it s not speaking to volumes and it s not speaking to escalating payouts at this point so we feel good about the underlying organic growth in the business with respect to technology spend you ll recall last year we were kind of 60 40 run the bank change the bank and it s more 50 50 this year so 11 5 billion of spend about half and half alevizos alevizakos hsbc analyst thank you very much marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer remember in the change of the bank it runs the whole gamut from platforms and controls to customer experience digital data r d so it s the whole spectrum operator your next question is from the line of matt o connor with deutsche bank matt o connor deutsche bank analyst good morning i just wanted to follow up on the net interest income and it came in a lot better than expected this quarter is there anything that s lumpy or one time that you d flag because if you annualize it you re already above the full year target at 58 billion plus and obviously there s day count drag this quarter and really just puts and takes with rates and balance sheet growth but it seems like the guidance is conservative versus where you re at right now marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer okay so we did slightly better in the first quarter two things driving it one is small but nevertheless is arguably non recurring which is we ve talked about the fact that overall in the company when we do these loan sales that net net there may be a small residual gain or loss that resides in treasury and it was a small gain in the first quarter in nii call it 50 million ph approximately and then in addition we talked in the fourth quarter about the fact that we were seeing the opportunity to deploy cash in short duration liquid investments that were high yielding than ioer that continued into the first quarter so we did benefit from that and it may or may not continue but we re not necessarily expecting that to continue all the way through and so i would say that day count was a drag as we look forward with some opportunities honestly obviously the risk associated with the flat yield curve not big but nevertheless net neutral to downward pressure or downward pressure its long end rates stay lower for longer as we don t have the tailwind anymore from higher rates and we continue to process the december rate hike you could see more rates paid to a little bit more into second quarter so there are risks and opportunities we still think it s a decent outlook but i don t think it s conservative i think its 58 billion is straight down the middle at this point the trouble with the yield curve is it can fluctuate dramatically over the short term and we shouldn t over interpret or over chase it at this point i think it s a decent estimate and we ll continue to update you matt o connor deutsche bank analyst okay and then just on the repositioning of the balance sheet and the approach to adding securities are you thinking any differently going forward than maybe you were six weeks ago you clearly seem more positive on the macro and obviously things can change there but are you approaching from the balance sheet management a little bit differently given may be more positive macro outlook marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer well so i mean we only spoke to you most recently about six weeks ago so the sort of overall answer is no not really we expected at that point that we would have a patient fed it turns out that all the central banks are pointing to being a little bit more dovish which we couldn t generally be constructive for the environment and for credit risk for the balance sheet obviously the curve being flatter is not sort of a compelling situation to add more duration but there s natural risk in our balance sheet so overall very little we feel good about the credit the curve is flat and we ll continue to manage the overall environment and company as we see the economy unfold matt o connor deutsche bank analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america erika najarian bank of america analyst yes hi good morning i just wanted to follow up marianne on the comments in the backdrop for lower rates for longer could you give us a sense on how you re thinking about your deposit strategy in retail and wholesale in other words i know you discussed some dynamics on pricing for the first quarter but when do you expect competition to taper off and do banks have room to actually lower deposit costs if the rate curve stays this way for a prolonged period of time marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer so i ll just put the big contextual answer will always be the same which is when we think about our strategy around deposits and deposit pricing it is 100 driven by what we re observing in our consumer behavior than what we re seeing in deposit flows and so that s the environment that we look at to determine what s happening and you ve seen naturally over the course of the last couple of years as rates have been rising that we ve seen flows of deposits to higher yielding alternatives whether it s investments or whether it s more recently in cds and that may continue we ll continue to watch that it is our expectation that rates will be relatively stable from here in terms of the short end and it s the short end that predominantly drives the sort of deposit pricing agenda so even if the curve is flatter as long as it s because the front end is stable i don t necessarily see deposit costs going down but we re going to continue to watch our customer behaviors and deposit flows and respond accordingly erika najarian bank of america analyst thank you and my follow up question is we heard you loud and clear during your prepared remarks that the increase in wholesale non accruals was idiosyncratic and i m wondering as we look at a tick up in non accrual loans in the corporate investment bank for the past two quarters are we just in the part of the cycle where we re just growing from a low base or should we expect a step down in the second quarter in non accruals similar to how we saw last year marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer there are a couple of situations that we would expect to maybe not be present in the second quarter but i would say it s a feature more of extremely low base and so from that any movement whether they are up or down it s somewhat exaggerated but we would continue to call the credit environment benign erika najarian bank of america analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin jefferies analyst thanks marianne just if i could ask you you mentioned that there are some signs that the economy is strengthening and i wanted to just ask you to can you split that between just what you re seeing on the consumer side versus the wholesale corporate side in terms of the spend numbers are obviously still double digit year over year some others have talked about a little bit of a slowdown you are just still saying quite good and then there is this unevenness about just capex and spending and corporate side so just could you just kind of walk us through just where you re seeing pockets of relative strength and improvement marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i mean i think that as it relates to us and in particular looking at the us consumer you ve got all of jobs more recently auto housing spend all generally encouraging and holding up well and robust and whether it s double digits or whether it s not we re continuing to see that and consumer confidence by the way which is still very high and has recovered from any sort of hangout from the equity market actions over the four quarters so for us us consumer has always been strong and confident and even if we re not all time high and confidence is still very high and generally the beta is and even some like housing and also that hasn t necessarily been super strong is looking encouraging and then on the global front it is a little harder but as you look at some of the areas that have been struggling a bit and europe would be a good example we would think that in the first quarter sort of transitory factors around social unrest and politics in brexit and they seem to be fading a little business confidence has recovered a little businesses are still spending on labor so generally a good side of the underlying confidence notwithstanding any kind of sentiment numbers and even there there s job growth there s wage growth helped by dovish monetary policy and general financial conditions having increase and eased so i think generally we feel optimistic across the consumer and the rest of the sector albeit it s sort of green shoots on the wholesale buy so it s early but it s what we were expecting to see and so it may continue ken usdin jefferies analyst yeah and one follow up just on investment banking business you had mentioned that the pipelines look good and obviously we ve seen the reopening of the ecm market your general outlook just again on that global point about the a bit unevenness between us and global just how do you feel about the advisory backdrop and obviously some big deals on the tape again today but had it been a little bit of an air pocket here partially probably because of the soft fourth quarter but how is that side of the business you re feeling and sounding from a backlog perspective marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so i would say that a couple of things obviously there were some deals that moved into the first quarter out of the second half of 2018 and so we did benefit from that but just as a general market matter m a is still attractive in a low growth environment albeit a growth environment investors are still constructive north america which is by far the biggest market for m a is still healthy and so europe was a big driver last year and europe has been a sharp drop off in volumes and wallet and so that may continue although we have a pretty good position there so i would say that the pipeline is down but still m a is attractive and people are looking for synergistic growth ken usdin jefferies analyst that makes sense thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with buckingham research jim mitchell buckingham research analyst hey good morning maybe just a follow up on the nii outlook i mean i think we ve talked about a flat curve what kind of levers do you have to pull if we were to see what some are speculating it doesn t sound like you re in that camp but if you were to get a rate cut how do you manage that how do you think the balance sheet reacts and nii reacts to a potential for rate cut over the next 12 months marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer right so the market which is usually more i would say pessimistic but more in that camp inaudible expecting and ease at the end of the year so we are not by the way as you point out so i think for 2019 s nii outlook it s not a clear and present danger and there will be any obviously we have on the way up on rates been over indexed to total end rates and so clearly if we were to have an ease it would have an impact on our nii if we felt generally that that was the direction that the economy and rates were going in then it might change our view on how we position the balance sheet but right now the fed is on course right now that s constructive for corporate deposit margins constructive for credit and generally constructive for how we re positioned on the balance sheet jim mitchell buckingham research analyst it s still you like you have room to i guess extend duration to kind of protect nii and nim if that would happen marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yes yes we do jim mitchell buckingham research analyst okay all right thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of saul martinez with ubs saul martinez ubs analyst hi good morning i wanted to follow up on matt s question on sort of idiosyncratic items in the quarter and lumpiness this is obviously a pretty strong quarter from an earnings standpoint earnings well ahead of my estimates and consensus especially in ccb but there weren t a lot of obvious non core items really called out so marianne can you just comment on the sustainability of the results and whether there is some idiosyncratic things that weren t necessarily called out during the call you mentioned corporate cash deployment revenues really high relative to historical levels there so are there any sort of idiosyncratic items that call into question how sustainable the results are marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer so first of all just sort of big pic first of all really high i think is a bit of an overstatement higher i think is fair no not really if there were you know we would have called them out there are a few little things so i m just going to call out a few of the things that we have mentioned we contributed 100 million to the foundation this quarter net net even with a very very small but nevertheless positive this quarter so there s a few little bits and pieces like that but if you look at revenue performance we did a little better across the board than you all were expecting we did better in ibcs and we gained a lot of share we did a little better in markets we did a little better in nii so we just got a little bit of a wind on our backs sort of phenomenon my probably my best answer to you is as happy as we are with the performance and we are gaining share and continuing to see our underlying drivers propel us forward and the momentum we got in our businesses we are not making material changes to our full year outlook so we ll still see how market performed for the year we do still expect as dimon mentioned at investor day that while we feel great about our positioning in investment banking in the first quarter coalition is still expecting the wallet to be down between 5 and 10 year on year so we do expect to gain share to help offset that but last year was a record so we haven t changed our full year guidance at all yet we ll take this as a very good down payment to that and if markets are constructive and wallet expands we will benefit from that but saul martinez ubs analyst okay no that s marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer we re not leading across and changing everything saul martinez ubs analyst that s helpful i ll change gears a little bit any update on distressed capital buffer what the fed is thinking there and when you think we could see a little bit more details or a little bit more clarity on the proposal marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer so the best i know there is a chance but not necessarily a probability that there could be an scb proposal for 2020 ccar so there s a set of meetings or a meeting coming out sometime in the summer that i think might be an important moment but we continue to work as constructively as we can to help understand the better way to bridge growth capital together with point in time capital but it s complicated so as we said the most important thing is not to issue an scb proposal it doesn t deal with the entire landscape of capital and look at it cohesively so we re talking about gsib we re talking about minimums we re talking about basel we re talking about scb it s complicated i d say there s a chance but not a probability that we might have something in time for 2020 ccar saul martinez ubs analyst got it thanks a lot operator your next question comes from the line of marty mosby of vining sparks marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer good morning marty marty mosby vining sparks analyst thanks for taking the question hey good morning first i want to ask as going to ccar now we re getting into that season again one of the things that i think has an impact is that what we had was a significant 30 plus growth in earnings last year so if you kind of look at the plan for your capital going forward and you think of holding payout ratios so to say they were just constant doesn t that kind of presume that you have kind of some wind behind the sales just to increase fairly significantly just off the increase in earnings last year marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer i think yes yes if you look at payout ratios obviously it s sort of described as a percentage then we said over the longer term we d expect to payout in a benign environment between 75 and 100 and analysts have estimates of 90 plus and obviously as earnings grow that would be a bigger dollar number but again we ll always calibrate that relative to our opportunity to invest in our businesses and its capacity not a promise so we ll continue to see how the whole environment unfolds but you re right as earnings continue to grow a strong payout ratio we re above the top end of our capital range so we are starting at a robust level would be a higher dollar number yes marty mosby vining sparks analyst and then jamie i was just curious i think one of the issues facing the industry and just we get pushed from the outside is that the cycle is 10 years old and my thought is that that internal time clock is just off this time and so if we look at it i think there s things that you re seeing or marianne that you see inside the company that probably dispel that the recession is kind of on the horizon so just wanted to get your comment on that as well that s my follow up question thanks marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so i guess i sorry go jamie jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer yes some sort of number that s out that australia had growth for 28 years and just so i m saying in notional but you have to have a recession they ve had a lot of back winds there s growth in asia and stuff like that but if you look at the american economy the consumer s in good shape the balance sheet s in good shape people are going back to the workforce companies have plenty of capital and capital expenditure is still up year over year little bit less this quarter than last quarter capital is being retained in the united states business confidence and consumer confidence are both rather high and not all time peaks rather high so you can just easily it can go on for years there s no law that says it has to stop we do make a list and look at all the other things geopolitical issues lower liquidity so there maybe a confluence of events that somehow cause the recession but it may not be in 2019 2020 2021 obviously at one point though there will probably be something and yeah i think the bigger short term risk would be something to go wrong in china the trade issues in china so i just wouldn t account on there having to be a recession in the short run kind of years marty mosby vining sparks analyst i agree thanks operator question comes from the line of andrew lim with societe generale andrew lim societe generale analyst hi morning thanks for taking my questions so my first question is on the end of period loans so if we look across the board it looks like there are some contraction there on a quarter to quarter basis of about 3 of 4 and i was just wondering if you saw that as a one quarter issue relating to what happened in 4q 18 and if you can give some color maybe on the quarters ahead speaking to companies ceos inaudible emerging again marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer yes so quarter on quarter and i think i mentioned a couple of these things but across our businesses for a variety of reasons on an end of period basis loans are down so like stepping through them the first one i would point out is mortgage and we just talked about that i think earlier in the call which is we continue to originate mortgage loans we continue to distribute them on portfolio we did do a loan sale which is part of the discussion that we ve been having with you about optimizing our balance sheet we did a sale at the end of the quarter so that s impacting mortgage loans in the cib and one of the reasons why we call out core loan growth ex cib is because we don t consider cib loans core because they are just by their nature oftentimes more episodic and lumpy and so we did see a see a large funded syndicated loan at the end of last quarter which was fully syndicated into the first quarter and then in our other businesses in asset wealth management a bit of seasonality a few pay downs in card seasonality so it s just sort of combination of factors but i would say two drivers cib and home lending cib on sort of a large syndication home lending on a loan sale ph going forward we ll continue to optimize the loan versus security part of our balance sheet as best we can for cash and liquidity purposes but just underlying core business demand for bank balance sheet lending i look at the middle market space and say we re still seeing solid demand it is in our investment areas and our expansion markets and specialized industries that we re still growing that portion of our loans in the mid single digits year on year andrew lim societe generale analyst yes great thanks so my following question is on marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer before you go into that there are going to be other areas where we just won t inaudible i mean in commercial real estate you see loan growth is much lower it s very competitive its prices have come down we continue to provide financing and funding for our core loans but we re not going to chase it down and similarly auto andrew lim societe generale analyst sure okay thanks so my follow on question is on clos so as some japanese institutions are big buyers of us highly rated clos but a few weeks ago the japanese fsa introduced some new rules saying that there had to be 5 risk retention by us issuers in order for the japanese institutions to buy them so i m just wondering if you re seeing yet any change in demand from japanese institutions and likewise on the other side if there is any change in behavior from us clo issuers in terms of trying to integrate 5 risk retention marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer so that is a great question the answer i m going to give you is not that i m aware of at this point but i ll have to follow up with you jamie are you aware no so andrew we ll come back to you not that i m aware of but it is a good but nevertheless quite detailed question andrew lim societe generale analyst okay thanks marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer thanks operator there are no further questions at this time marianne lake executive vice president chief financial officer thank you everyone operator thank you for

source new currency soon ncube newsday zimbabwe april 12 2019 by everson mushava finance minister mthuli ncube has revealed that the country will have its own new fully fledged currency within the next 12 months to ease the cash shortages on the market in an interview with united states based bloomberg television yesterday ncube also said zimbabwe will soon introduce a central bank reference rate as part of measures to save the economy from further collapse ncube is in washington dc for the international monetary fund imf and world bank 2019 spring meetings where he hopes to open new lines of credit for the country that is desperate for industrial re capitalisation ncube said he also hopes to close the gap between the exchange rate for united states dollars in the official and parallel markets using rtgs dollars which the government introduced in february asked to be specific on timelines of the introduction of the new currency ncube was coy with currency reforms you can never be precise but i say 12 months i am preparing minds i am preparing your mind so it is coming ncube said the announcement comes at a time the official and parallel market rate of the us and rtgs continue to widen since the introduction of the virtual currency in february when government dumped the 1 1 parity that had been in place since 2016 when the bond notes were introduced the introduction of the rtgs was accompanied by the introduction of a market based foreign exchange market where market forces using an inter bank rate would determine the us value against the local virtual currency but after holding firm at 1 2 5 for a few days the rtgs has plunged and pushed up the prices of goods raising fears that the country could be sliding back to the 2008 hyper inflationary era when zimbabwe experienced a record 179 6 billion percent inflation rate the annual inflation rate is now at its highest since the 2008 hyperinflation era despite the month on month price growth slowing to 1 7 in february from 10 8 a month earlier but asked how he hoped to contain the continuing collapse of the rtgs that has given in to the us barely two months after its introduction ncube said the billions of us to be racked in during this year s tobacco selling season will stabilise the currency ncube admitted the country was having fiscal challenges but claimed the situation would soon be under control the weakening of the rtgs ncube said was a result of the huge demand for foreign currency there is demand for foreign currency in the market foreign currency is always short but we are looking forward at an improved tobacco season we earn about a billion dollars us from the sale of tobacco globally so we expect that to stabilise the market in the next few months of course it is early days we just introduced the new currency regime a month ago ncube said so it is trying to find its way trying to find equilibrium it will get there it will close that gap between the parallel market and the official flouting market rate ncube did not elaborate how he intends to close the ever widening gap between the official and parallel market rate of the us against the rtgs but said the decline would soon stop the decline cannot carry on you know why because from the fiscal front things are very tight because previously the fiscus was the source of money growth and therefore causing volatility and the weakness of the currency we don t expect the currency to go under pressure the currency cannot run too far away frankly quizzed why zimbabwe needs the international financial institutions if recording fiscal surplus ncube said the lending institutions were large infrastructure investors and africa zimbabwe included has a huge infrastructural deficiency in energy and other sectors early this week reserve bank of zimbabwe governor john mangudya slammed businesses for wantonly raising prices of basic commodities based on the movement of the exchange rate he said the rise in the parallel market rate of the us was not a significant factor to determine the value of a product accusing business of exaggerating the effect of the exchange rate in determining prices of goods and services on wednesday the imf warned that the country will slide into a recession this year and its economy would shrink by 5 2 as opposed to the 4 2 growth rate projected earlier
my unpublished 100 000 word book the financial jigsaw is being serialised here weekly in 100 issues by peter j underwood author quote of the week a successful man is one who can lay a firm foundation with the bricks others have thrown at him david brinkley last week continued with chapter 9 looking at deflation and illustrating the effects of inflation with yet another thought experiment here is the link to last week issue 46 basel iii bank of international settlements bis last week was also a major landmark for banks because basel iii regulations have now come into effect after some years of preparation the general emphasis is to cause banks to hold greater amounts of reserves than in the past which may well impact on their profitability going forward here is an overview for those who may wish to know more and in connection with basel iii this story translated from a russian site is not confirmed to be true as yet but if it is so will prove to be quite a bombshell because it is forecasting global mayhem in the autumn just six months away now that brexit might be coming to a conclusion after almost three years i will continue to provide weekly updates as events progress brexit update 12th april 2019 parliament has continued yet more debates during the week all of which remain inconclusive with no definite decision either way as to how to carry forward the exit strategy the week ended with the two leaders theresa may and jeremy corbyn engaging in head to head discussions in an effort to agree some sort of compromise which could be acceptable to a majority of mps in parliament in the early hours of thursday 11th april the european summit meeting agreed to extend the brexit deadline to 31st october 2019 but with a review at the end of june should a decision be passed by parliament to leave by 22nd june this means that uk will have to engage in the european elections for meps in uk on 23nd may 2019 theresa may reported at the press conference in the early hours that she believed that the uk could still exit the eu by 22nd may and therefore avoid sending meps to europe details of parliament s deliberations can be found here the uk parliament is on holiday now until after easter but inter party negotiations will continue with the hope that a solution for exit will be found before the uk has to complete the european elections on 23rd may the big news this week is the launch of the new brexit party headed by nigel farage who is a great friend of donald trump and they are expected to gain many eu seats if it gets that far chapter 9 inflation deflation there are known knowns there are things we know that we know there are known unknowns there are things that we now know we don t know but there are also unknown unknowns there are things we do not know we don t know the original source of this koan may be landmark education of seattle washington although generally it is attributed to former us defence secretary donald rumsfeld there are three kinds of lies lies damned lies and statistics mark twain in the absence of the gold standard there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation there is no safe store of value alan greenspan savings compound the problem there is yet another aspect to our thought experiment which economists find so fearful this is where the money supply is distorted by people not spending but saving part of their disposable income using the first set of parameters from last week there are 20 apples and a money stock of 10 we assume now that 5 of the money stock is not available for spending but placed under a mattress for a rainy day because the consumer believes that prices might fall in the future the market now has only 5 of money available for consumption thus the market will find its equilibrium by setting the price of apples at 25p each and economists will say that deflation has occurred and people are saving too much they will further urge the government to make up for the lack of spending power by injecting 5 into the economy to return prices to normal what economists have missed is that the money stock has not changed rather it has been temporarily removed from the market to be spent on another day if the government responds to the economist s pressure they will have created a permanent inflation downstream by increasing the stock of money unnecessarily examples of inflationary effects in closed economies the economists fear is in fact well placed because if the savings situation is allowed to continue for a long time prices will continue to fall and this would result in failing businesses and unemployment will increase there is always a certain amount of what economists describe as stickiness in both input and output prices if we are constantly matching supply and demand we would need to continually adjust wages and salaries and check price labels every day which would be both confusing and impractical however this has happened on many occasions germany in 1922 3 and more recently in zimbabwe in 2008 and venezuela now but these events were confined to a virtually closed national economic system and did not seriously infect the global financial system they did not become systemic one aim of national economic policy is that of price stability and money printing works against this in general in the last experiment when the government adds 5 to the economy it initially benefits those that receive the money first government and banks and penalises the late receivers of the money the wage earners and the poor thus transferring resources from poor asset holders to the asset rich class thus increasing wealth inequality which we witness today the early receivers the rich will spend their money in a certain way or more often than not actually invest the extra money rather than spending it again distorting relative prices in the economy and increasing asset prices which we see in 2019 an expanding economy adds more problems extending the thought experiment a problem arises when the economy improves people reverse their hoarding traits and start spending their savings and borrowing more money extending our experiment yet again we now have 20 apples and 15 of money stock in the economy meaning that the price of apples will eventually balance the market to arrive at 75p each showing that inflation has returned with a vengeance we can further extend the experiment by assuming that 5 extra is borrowed into existence which has increased debt thus the money stock becomes 20 and apples are selling for 1 each this can be compounded again if at the same time the supply of apples falls to less than 20 when prices could shoot through the roof and eventually arrive at a state of hyperinflation or extreme inflation this occurred in the early 1970s when the price of oil increased due to restrictions place on oil supply by the opec oil producing countries energy supply is crucially important because people have no option but to consume oil and gas regardless of price and which economists describe as price elasticity of demand furthermore in a global economy almost all raw materials and goods need to be transported at one stage or another during the distribution cycle energy prices therefore influence many of the costs associated with delivery and manufacture of end products this aspect of economics will be discussed in more detail in chapter 11 about the basics of macroeconomic theory the complication of multiple products confuses the simple model so far we have been dealing with a one product economic model using apples but our world in reality has many and varied products offering people a choice to substitute alternative products when prices change for example if beef prices increase consumers can switch to cheaper chicken or as happened in the 1970s inflation period when pensioners on fixed incomes were so pressed to buy basic supplies they began consuming pet foods in place of regular produce also in a multi product world inflation from excessive credit growth will cause changes in relative prices that result in unsustainable investment as happened to housing in the period 2001 2007 deflation in the bust phase of an economic cycle is a partial realignment of these relative prices closer to what society really wants to be produced the printing of money simply interferes with this essential clearing process the real solution is to end fractional reserve banking and central banking systems and replace it with a sound money system as advocated by the austrian school of economists who are gaining more credibility as time passes the principles will be discussed further in chapter 11 the virtues of deflation versus inflation i consider inflation to be much worse than deflation because it robs wage earners of their purchasing power and seriously affects the relative poor in our community central banks are the primary cause of inflation and are the main reason for the growth of income inequalities as the rich get richer and the middle class tends to sink towards relative poverty this trend has been growing since the 1971 sound money system based on gold was replaced with fiat currency in the form of the mighty american dollar ever since the dollar has depreciated in value continuously as central banks print more money and create inflation now it has lost 96 of its value during the last century the banks have been generous in supporting economic research in academic institutions serving to theoretically justify the central banks inflationary policies the common fallacy of a little inflation is good economics is disseminated by the mainstream media and economists to lull the populations into a false sense of wellbeing when in fact inflation is nothing short of theft because it reduces the value of money in your pocket a ten percent per annum inflation over seven years halves the value of your money and for savers and particularly pensioners this is a daunting prospect we know that the government cpi figures substantially understate inflation but we have no way of measuring the actual rate of inflation which we are each experiencing only by noting our perceptions and daily living activity to be continued next saturday click to visit the tbp store for great tbp merchandise as an amazon associate i earn from

frank clemente americans for tax fairness tax day when we settle our personal accounts with uncle sam is also a good day to take account of our tax system overall that s especially true this year when the first tax returns prepared under the new rules of the trump gop tax law are due we should be asking whether our system is fair whether it raises the revenue we need whether it promotes economic growth and equality the answer to all three questions is unfortunately no the tax code already full of loopholes for the wealthy and corporations was laden with even more by the new tax law that law will also add nearly 2 trillion to the national debt endangering services like medicare medicaid and education as well as vital new initiatives like lowering healthcare costs and improving road and bridges and the trump gop tax cuts are doing little to promote economic growth but a lot to promote economic inequality even as the gap between rich and poor reaches gilded age proportions over 20 percent of the trump gop tax cuts are estimated to have gone to the wealthiest 1 percent of americans last year and once the law is fully in effect eight years from now the imbalance will get even worse 83 percent of the benefits will go to one percenters big profitable corporations got a 40 percent cut in their tax rate and the new tax rate on the foreign profits of u s companies is only half the domestic rate creating big incentives to shift jobs and profits offshore republicans desperate to enact their skewed to the rich tax plan assured the american people the tax cuts would pay for themselves wrong the federal budget deficit jumped by almost 100 billion in the first quarter of the current fiscal year alone compared to the same period last year before the republican tax law went into effect contributing to that growing budget gap was a nearly one third drop in corporate tax receipts rather than reverse all their tax giveaways to the wealthy republicans want to make up the shortfall by cutting public services working families rely on while incredibly cutting taxes on the wealthy even more in his recently released budget president trump proposed slashing 1 4 trillion from medicare medicaid and the affordable care act while cutting taxes by 1 1 trillion once again mostly to the benefit of the rich trump doesn t just want to cut the aca s budget he wants to eliminate it altogether that would cost 20 million americans their health insurance while taking away the protection for 130 million people with pre existing medical conditions who would pay more or not be able to afford insurance without the aca big winners from the aca repeal are the wealthy along with prescription drug firms and health insurers whose steadily rising prices squeeze the same families facing reduced public services that s because they d no longer pay 600 billion in taxes to help people afford insurance president trump promised workers would benefit from the corporate tax cuts guaranteeing that working families would get a 4 000 boost in wages nearly a year and a half later according to a tally by americans for tax fairness only 4 percent of employees have seen any increase in their compensation tied to the tax cuts and the great majority of those payouts have been one time bonuses not permanent raises corporations aren t spending their tax savings in any significant way on increased investment either where the dollars are really going predictably is into the bank accounts of powerful ceos and wealthy shareholders corporations have announced over 1 trillion in stock buybacks since the republican plan was signed into law these boost the price of stocks and most stock is owned by the wealthy so a tax day review of our tax system yields troubling results but we can fix that congress can begin by repealing the tax cuts for the rich and corporations in the recent gop tax law then it can start closing all the other special loopholes inserted in our tax code over the years by the wealthy and well connected those cost us trillions of dollars in public revenue we need to fulfill solemn promises we ve made to ourselves like social security and medicare as well as invest in our future through bold new investments once those loopholes are closed on some future tax day we can count ourselves proud participants in a fair share tax system frank clemente is executive director of americans for tax fairness
for communications professor jason jarvis and his wife jun california just got more expensive the inglewood couple who last year paid 16 000 in state and local taxes were only able to deduct 10 000 of it from their federal taxes this year judy lin calmatters the federal government really jacked us he said i don t have a problem with my tax dollars going toward education homelessness i m in favor of all that but a tax cut for billionaires off my back that s too much cao jarvis a 45 year old democrat who took the salt hit the federal tax cuts and jobs act signed last year by president donald trump and cheered by republicans in congress cost the jarvis family between 4 500 and 5 000 in deductions raising their bill from the internal revenue service even after a larger child tax credit for their 15 month old son kellar the financial hit came with political bruises for jarvis a 45 year old democrat who disliked how the republican plan slashed taxes for corporations and people making a lot more than he does the federal government really jacked us he said i don t have a problem with my tax dollars going toward education homelessness i m in favor of all that but a tax cut for billionaires off my back that s too much while millions of california families saw their federal taxes fall this tax season the jarvis family is among an estimatedhouseholds who are paying more actually some 12 billion more according to the franchise tax board that s because the cap on state and local tax salt deductions disproportionately impacted progressive states with high taxes by limiting the amount residents used to be able to deduct from their federal filings now as the golden state s first tax day without the old salt break approaches that dear departed deduction has been topic a in california as taxpayers are filing their returns this month many of them are discovering the bite the federally imposed salt cap is taking out of their wallet state controller betty yee a democrat noted in fact the topic recently and randomly popped up in the middle of a discussion on the state economy sponsored by the sacramento press club featuring yee state treasurer fiona ma and lt gov eleni kounalakis it s just scandalous that the trump administration did away with our salt deduction kounalakis declared to a round of hearty applause from the capitol audience california ranks 10th in overall taxation and has the highest personal income tax rate at 13 3 for millionaires it used to be that affluent californians could salve that wound by capitalizing on unlimited salt deductions to lower their federal obligations no more now as the lieutenant governor noted at the press club conversation that lost haven has not only set off statewide grousing but also could give wealthier people an incentive to flee threatening california s finances since the state relies for half of its personal income taxes on people making 500 000 or more this is a real existential threat to our ability to ensure that our tax collection is going to result in what we need to fund our general fund lt gov eleni kounalakis currently the salt cap will expire at the end of 2025 meaning the loss of the full deduction is temporary if political winds shift and there s an effort to make it permanent the professor says california may need to rethink its own tax structure this is a real existential threat to our ability to ensure that our tax collection is going to result in what we need to fund our general fund said kounalakis steve levy director and senior economist of the center for continuing study of the california economy begs to differ the overall federal personal income tax changes aren t really that dramatic and the households paying more in 2018 can afford to pay more he said this is true california s progressive tax structure means about 43 000 top bracket residents earning more than 1 million a year will pay the lion s share of the salt cap by contributing 9 billion more to uncle sam according to ftb levy said he and his wife paid more this year because they were hurt by the salt cap however his son paid less as a result of the increased child tax credit and benefited from a 20 deduction on self employed income overall levy said the personal income tax changes are not a big deal however there s a band of 619 000 taxpayers earning between 100 000 and 250 000 who are being particularly hurt by the loss of the full deduction especially those who purchased in recent years during a strong real estate market the median home price in california iscompared tonationally according to the national association of realtors this upper middle group is relatively affluent but california is a high cost state and members of the cohort not only pay a significant amount to the state through income taxes but contribute the most of any group on property taxes since they tend to be homeowners according to the ftb 5 9 million taxpayers reported itemized deductions on federal income taxes in 2015 of them 2 1 million made between 100 000 and 250 000 this group claimed 11 billion in real estate tax deductions more than any other group why them asks darien shanske a law professor at the university of california davis it s hard to understand why they should be the ones to get a big tax increase a very wealthy real estate investor in texas doesn t get a tax increase and that s the arbitrariness of it right shanske was among a group of legal experts supportive of a state workaround former senate president pro tem kevin de león proposed legislation last year that would have sidestepped the 10 000 limit by offering state tax credits in such a way that california taxpayers could then claim charitable deductions on their federal filings the tax maneuver wasby former gov jerry brown as too complex at the same time the internal revenue service proposed regulations banning such state workarounds currently the salt cap will expire at the end of 2025 meaning the loss of the full deduction is temporary if political winds shift and there s an effort to make it permanent the professor says california may need to rethink its own tax structure if it s temporary i don t know there s much to be done shanske said if it s permanent then it is something that california has to take seriously who s getting the blame new york gov andrew cuomo has suggested that changes to the federal tax code are causing some high income earners to flee that high cost state however a new report from moody s this week says it hasn t found the salt cap is causing new yorkers or californians to flee just yet the impact of the salt cap enacted in 2017 will be felt widely for the first time this tax season and possibly spur some out migration but jobs and demographic trends will continue to influence relocation patterns more than tax burdens moody s stated the impact of the salt cap enacted in 2017 will be felt widely for the first time this tax season and possibly spur some out migration but jobs and demographic trends will continue to influence relocation patterns more than tax burdens a new report from moody s where the votes are professor shanske said one way to give this upper middle group relief is to raise the salt cap to 20 000 this would allow the federal government to continue reaping taxes from the very wealthy the jarvis family is typical of this band of people who feel middle class even if they don t fit the description of middle class last year the pew research center pinpointed the middle of the middle class asfor a household of three by comparison jarvis and his wife jun a buyer for a tool importing company made a combined 125 000 last year they have an 800 square foot home in inglewood to be close to jarvis work at loyola marymount university still they are on a budget the tax changes hurt us said jarvis between mortgage child care paying off student loans the credit cards look there s plenty of people in this state who are way worse off than we are but that money mattered indeed many families who purchased homes in recent years say they factored the tax deductions into their monthly finances darrel lawrence 43 and his wife rolled all the equity they gained on a two bedroom starter home in poway that they bought for 315 000 in 2011 into a 750 000 home four years later in an unincorporated part of san diego county once their daughter arrived we wanted something a little newer and nicer so we rolled everything into a bigger house knowing it would be a big mortgage payment but the interest was all deductible said the technology worker we had property taxes and mello roos fees but that was all deductible i always assumed that it would be grandfathered in i just never thought they would change the rules on us when everybody budgets for this lawrence a democrat said he places blame squarely on republicans the thing that drives me bananas about this is not only did my tax bill go up 2 000 services are getting slashed and the federal deficit is exploding he said it just feels like there s this incredible graft going on where you re taking more money from me you re giving it away to these really wealthy people and you re increasing the debt californians could be voting their pocketbooks on this issue polling data suggested the 10 000 salt deduction along with the 750 000 cap on mortgage interest deduction factored into republican losses when democrats swept all seven u s house seats in orange county then again a state with 18 5 million personal income tax returns each household has a different experience in dollar terms the federal taxes for 2018 were almost identical even though we made considerably more money peter antonell a 64 year old retired cal fire captain peter antonell a 64 year old retired cal fire captain who lives in north monterey county said his partner made 30 000 more last year than in 2017 but their marginal tax rate fell to 24 from 28 causing them to pay the same amount of taxes as last year in dollar terms the federal taxes for 2018 were almost identical even though we made considerably more money antonell said the couple also made large charitable donations in the aftermath of the camp fire in butte county so they were able to itemize deductions rather than take the 24 000 standard deduction for joint filers antonell said it wasn t fair of congressional republicans to target california for revenue by limiting the salt deduction but he also doesn t like california s high income and sales taxes the new law certainly accentuates that taxes in blue states are pretty high he said as a republican retiree who left his presidential vote blank in 2016 antonell said he entertains the idea of moving to carson valley nevada where there s no state income tax if we end up determining that the tax burden at the state and local level becomes too burdensome then we ll leave he said is a nonprofit nonpartisan media venture

u s review no need for the fed to budge inflation picked up in march with the cpi rising 0 4 and strengthening to 1 9 yr yr the trend in inflation remains tame however with consumer prices ex food and energy edging down to 2 0 on a year ago basis small business optimism was little changed in march and remains noticeably below last year s levels job openings fell sharply in february while initial jobless claims fell to a new cycle low the first week of april the late timing of easter may be holding down the latest claims data leading us to believe that the overall pace of hiring is likely to remain slower than last year no need for the fed to budge incoming data this week showed that u s growth continues to hold up although it is unlikely to be on the brink of a significant reacceleration inflation remains near 2 while the pace of the labor market s improvement is easing on balance together nothing this week suggested that the fed may need to adjust its patient policy stance any time soon small business optimism was virtually unchanged in march despite the stock market having recovered from its end of year rough patch and the government shutdown now firmly in the rearview mirror the index remains noticeably below the current cycle s high reached in august the lack of a rebound suggests that small businesses are feeling the economy s recent slowdown small businesses expectations for sales have come down since the fourth quarter and fewer respondents indicate now is a good time to expand hiring plans have come down as a result although difficulty finding workers in such a tight labor market may on its own be reducing expansion plans the availability of quality labor remains the most frequently cited problem among small businesses even as hiring plans have been pared back a record share of firms report having at least one job that is hard to fill other data released this week also suggest the labor market remains tight but point to a more moderate pace of hiring ahead total job openings continue to outnumber unemployed workers but the vacancy rate fell to a one year low in february job openings can bounce around from month to month and are subject to big revisions so the 538k drop in openings in february does not unequivocally signal a collapse in demand for workers it does however offer another sign that the labor market may be nearing an inflection point as temporary hiring has also slowed and consumers views of the labor market have deteriorated slightly jobless claims have been better in recent weeks with initial filings falling to a 50 year the late timing of easter this year may be flattering the recent figures but the multi decade low suggests at least that the slowdown in hiring is likely to be only modest at the same time there are tentative signs of the labor market softening consumers are also facing a bit more inflation the consumer price index rose 0 4 in march its largest gain in more than a year higher prices at the gas pump were partly to blame but consumers also saw their grocery bills increase consumer price inflation is rising again on a year ago basis and contributing to slower growth in real wages the

its recent band with inflation expectations in check and growth slowing back to trend we see little risk of inflation moving meaningfully above 2 this year u s outlook industrial production tuesday manufacturing has lost momentum this year as the global slowdown and trade headwinds are becoming more evident in the sector manufacturers shed 6 000 jobs in march the first cut in a little over a year and a half the decline in employment and mixed pmi readings for the month suggest it is unlikely we will see a manufacturing rebound in tuesday s industrial production release production elsewhere will likely be mixed the unseasonably cold weather across the nation in march likely boosted utilities output again that month but the decline in average hours worked in the mining sector may hold back a significant gain in mining output we expect to see a slight bounce in march but production growth has downshifted the ism index is lower on trend in recent months and durable goods

wonky few months for consumer data we expect retail sales to have regained some steady footing in march the 1 6 drop in december sales caused nominal spending on goods to enter the first quarter on a weak note sales continued to struggle at the start of this year rebounding 0 7 in january but edging down 0 2 in february underlying fundamentals remain supportive of strong growth in spending the labor market is robust household balance sheets are in generally good shape and indices of consumer confidence remain at high levels on that basis we look for retail sales to have risen 0 9 in march

month housing starts friday fear that the fed would continue to hike interest rates led to a weak outturn for housing activity at the end of last year affordability concerns deterred potential buyers from making a purchase and builders slashed home prices to shed inventories with decreased demand and an uncertain outlook starts weakened the fed s pivot on monetary policy appears to have arrested the slide in housing starts but has not reversed it home prices and mortgage rates have both trended lower and remain below their year ago levels mortgage applications surged in march suggesting the cooling in prices is driving greater demand while builder confidence has also rebounded from last year s lows we should see a modest increase in march housing starts as recent conditions suggest a

mixed bag on the global front but one which might be considered an improvement considering the pervasive pessimism that has prevailed in recent weeks starting on a subdued note the imf cut its 2019 gdp growth forecast to 3 3 which would be the slowest growth since 2016 the u k news was better with february services and industrial activity both rising although an extension to the u k s brexit deadline could still growth slow going forward eurozone industrial output was also less bad than feared and potentially consistent with an increase in q1 industrial activity the u k s brexit saga continues it has been another week and another missed deadline for u k politicians as they try to map out a path for the u k s exit from the european union in early april u k pm may s brexit proposal was defeated in parliament for a third time at the same time parliament has been unable to garner a majority for an alternative course of action while talks between may and opposition leader jeremy corbyn have not led to any breakthrough without a credible u k path forward the other 27 european union countries granted the u k an extension of the article 50 deadline until october 31 while that might be a short term positive in that it removes the immediate risk of a no deal brexit it is potentially a longer term negative given that uncertainty about the u k s future relationship with the other european union countries will persist the early part of 2019 has been notable for relativity resilient growth even against this backdrop of brexit uncertainty u k february gdp rose 0 2 month over month a solid result on the back of a 0 5 gain in january service sector output rose 0 1 while industrial production rose 0 6 that said there are signs from the survey data that part of the early 2019 growth reflects stockpiling of inventories especially in the context of a long brexit extension and the resultant and ongoing uncertainty the pace of u k economic growth is likely to slow going forward ecb steady in april after a significant policy shift at its march monetary policy meeting the european central bank s april announcement was a much tamer affair the ecb held its policy interest rates steady and made no changes to its forward guidance saying that interest rates would remain at their present low levels at least through the end of this year the ecb also provided no extra details for now surrounding its new round of targeted long term loans and said that the risks around the eurozone growth outlook remain tilted towards the downside since the ecb s march meeting there have been some tentative signs of growth stabilization the eurozone services pmi rose in march although the manufacturing pmi remains in contraction territory that said even though eurozone industrial production fell 0 2 month over month in february industrial activity for the first two months of the year is up 0 8 compared to its q4 level modestly positive news from latin america the past week saw some mildly encouraging news from latin america although the region s economies still face longer term challenges brazil s february retail sales firmed more than forecast to 3 9 year

march cpi inflation was well behaved edging higher to 4 0 in brazil longer term growth prospects remain heavily dependent on pension reform and fiscal consolidation while in mexico policy uncertainty remains a potential medium term growth negative global outlook china gdp wednesday china rounds out its first quarter figures with the release of a comprehensive set of activity data in the coming week overall we expect gdp growth may have held steady at 6 4 year over year although the consensus sees a further slowing to 6 3 generally service sector growth has held up better than manufacturing growth a trend we think likely continued in the first quarter in addition to assessing the extent of the overall q1 slowdown there will also be much interest in whether there are any signs of stabilization in activity hinted at by some encouraging readings for the march manufacturing and services pmis the consensus forecast is that these soft signals could translate over to the hard data march retail sales are expected to rise 8 4 year over year while industrial production is expected to rise by 6 0 both outcomes would be stronger than the gains reported for the january february period previous 6 4 wells fargo 6 4 consensus 6 3 year over year canada cpi wednesday canadian inflation trends have been benign in recent months and probably remained so in march suggesting the bank of canada will likely keep policy interest rates steady for some time the headline cpi should quicken to 1 8 year over year as a recovery in oil prices in recent months should be reflected in energy prices and overall cpi trends services prices remained contained however while the central bank core cpi inflation measures should remain modestly below the 2 inflation target next week s activity data and confidence surveys are also unlikely to offer much reason for the bank of canada to contemplate a change in interest rates for now with february retail sales among the more notable data

fargo 1 8 year over year u k retail sales thursday despite the brexit uncertainty that continues to hang over the u k economy growth has remained reasonably solid during the early part of 2019 while that may in part be due to inventory stockpiling ahead of the u k s eventual exit from the european union we note that consumer spending trends have been quite steady in the early part of this year after increases in both january and february the consensus expects some payback with retail sales forecast to decline 0 3 month over month in march that said overall gains in retail sales and industrial production in recent months mean we think that q1 gdp is on track for growth of 0 5 quarter over quarter next week we also see the release of price and wage data inflation likely remain benign in march with the cpi expected to rise 2 0 year over year and the core cpi expected to rise 1 9 look for wage trends to remain sturdy with average weekly earnings expected to rise 3 5 year over year in the three months through february previous 0 4 consensus 0 3 month over month point of view interest rate watch minutes show fed to remain on hold the minutes of the march 20 meeting of the federal open market committee fomc were released this week that meeting was notable because the dot plot that was released at the conclusion of the meeting showed that most committee members thought that rates would be on hold through the end of the year in december the dot plot indicated that most fomc members thought that rates would be at least 50 bps higher at the end of 2019 in addition the fomc decided at its march 20 meeting on concrete steps to bring the shrinking of the fed s balance sheet which currently stands at 3 9 trillion to an end in september 2019 top chart the minutes of the march 20 meeting made it clear that the committee is in no hurry to raise the fed funds rate from its current range of 2 25 to 2 50 at least not for the foreseeable future however none of the 17 committee members who attended the march 20 meeting projected that the range for the fed funds rate would be lower at the end of 2019 than it is now middle chart the minutes said that the committee believes that sustained economic expansion continued strength in the labor market and inflation near the fomc s objective of 2 are the most likely outcomes for the u s economy in the period ahead in our view incoming economic data would need to show that 2019 real gdp growth will undershoot the 2 1 rate q4 q4 that the fomc currently projects and or inflation will come in significantly lower than the 2 objective for the committee to cut rates in coming months pricing in the bond market at present shows that market participants believe there is a one in three chance that the fed cuts rates by the september fomc meeting that probability rises to a bit more than 50 by the december policy meeting if our view that the fomc will remain in hold throughout 2019 is correct then the back end of the yield curve should rise as the market prices out the expected rate cut as we write the yield on the 10 year treasury security is roughly 2 54 bottom chart we look for this yield to drift up to 2 70 by the end of the year credit market insights consumer credit growth stabilizes u s consumer debt growth eased in february to 15 2b from 17 7b below market expectations revolving credit including credit card borrowing reached a new high of 1 06t climbing 3b from the previous month non revolving credit which includes educational loans and automobiles increased only 12 2b after rising 15 1b in january the data suggest that consumer borrowing remains strong due to higher wages and job growth household debt ticked up in the fourth quarter of 2018 with mortgage balances almost unchanged from the previous quarter the total amount of outstanding student loans increased 15b over the fourth quarter reaching 1 46t student loan debt is now the second highest consumer debt category behind mortgage debt with over 44 million borrowers of all demographics and age groups 11 4 of aggregate student debt was 90 days delinquent in q4 2018 a slight improvement from the previous quarter the growth in student loan debt remains a concern among analysts as it represents one of the country s most widespread financial burdens on balance household balance sheets remain generally healthy and consumer fundamentals remain strong that is despite the recent soft patch in consumer spending consumer confidence remains high as we expect the first quarter lull in consumption is only temporary we do not see a large pull back in borrowing topic of the week the max impact of boeing s 737 problem boeing s cut to production of the 737 line of aircraft is not an all out stop but rather a scaling back by about 20 of its earlier production rate still the production cuts are expected to hold down gdp slightly while the grounding of the 737 max is expected to generate bigger waves for equipment spending exports and inventories over the remainder of the year prior to scaling back boeing stated it was planning to produce 52 737 aircraft per month and the 737 max model was expected to account for roughly 90 of 737 deliveries in 2019 boeing expected to raise production to 57 aircraft per month in june 2019 the production cuts take that figure down to 42 aircrafts per month by mid april at an annualized pace adjusted for inflation the decreased production is expected to subtract about 9 billion from output in the second quarter or shave about 0 2 percentage points from q2 gdp growth if as we expect boeing provides a fix to the 737 max system and production ramps back up in the third quarter a catch up boost of a similar magnitude would occur in the meantime the current halt in deliveries is expected to weigh on equipment spending and exports without receipt of the aircraft and corresponding payment purchases that were expected in the second quarter by u s and foreign buyers are to be postponed inventories are set to pile up however which should largely offset the near term drop in spending and keep the impact to topline gdp minimal the precise impact to gdp will depend on how long boeing produces the 737 at the lower rate and how long it takes various aviation authorities around the world to give the 737 max the all clear to resume flying our modeling of the economic impact suggests that q2 gdp growth will be held back but a catch up boost will materialize either in the third quarter or over subsequent quarters depending on how long it takes for the backlog in shipments to run its course

california taxpayers jason and june cao jarvis with their 15 month old son kellar outside their home in inglewood photo by iris schneider for calmatters for communications professor jason jarvis and his wife jun california just got more expensive the inglewood couple who last year paid 16 000 in state and local taxes were only able to deduct 10 000 of it from their federal taxes this year the federal tax cuts and jobs act signed last year by president donald trump and cheered by republicans in congress cost the jarvis family between 4 500 and 5 000 in deductions raising their bill from the internal revenue service even after a larger child tax credit for their 15 month old son kellar the financial hit came with political bruises for jarvis a 45 year old democrat who disliked how the republican plan slashed taxes for corporations and people making a lot more than he does the federal government really jacked us he said i don t have a problem with my tax dollars going toward education homelessness i m in favor of all that but a tax cut for billionaires off my back that s too much while millions of california families saw their federal taxes fall this tax season the jarvis family is among an estimated 1 million households who are paying more actually some 12 billion more according to the franchise tax board that s because the cap on state and local tax salt deductions disproportionately impacted progressive states with high taxes by limiting the amount residents used to be able to deduct from their federal filings now as the golden state s first tax day without the old salt break approaches that dear departed deduction has been topic a in california as taxpayers are filing their returns this month many of them are discovering the bite the federally imposed salt cap is taking out of their wallet state controller betty yee a democrat noted in fact the topic recently and randomly popped up in the middle of a discussion on the state economy sponsored by the sacramento press club featuring yee state treasurer fiona ma and lt gov eleni kounalakis it s just scandalous that the trump administration did away with our salt deduction kounalakis declared to a round of hearty applause from the capitol audience who took the salt hit california ranks 10th in overall taxation and has the highest personal income tax rate at 13 3 for millionaires it used to be that affluent californians could salve that wound by capitalizing on unlimited salt deductions to lower their federal obligations no more now as the lieutenant governor noted at the press club conversation that lost haven has not only set off statewide grousing but also could give wealthier people an incentive to flee threatening california s finances since the state relies for half of its personal income taxes on people making 500 000 or more this is a real existential threat to our ability to ensure that our tax collection is going to result in what we need to fund our general fund said kounalakis steve levy director and senior economist of the center for continuing study of the california economy begs to differ the overall federal personal income tax changes aren t really that dramatic and the households paying more in 2018 can afford to pay more he said this is true california s progressive tax structure means about 43 000 top bracket residents earning more than 1 million a year will pay the lion s share of the salt cap by contributing 9 billion more to uncle sam according to ftb levy said he and his wife paid more this year because they were hurt by the salt cap however his son paid less as a result of the increased child tax credit and benefited from a 20 deduction on self employed income overall levy said the personal income tax changes are not a big deal however there s a band of 619 000 taxpayers earning between 100 000 and 250 000 who are being particularly hurt by the loss of the full deduction especially those who purchased in recent years during a strong real estate market the median home price in california is 534 140 compared to 249 500 nationally according to the national association of realtors this upper middle group is relatively affluent but california is a high cost state and members of the cohort not only pay a significant amount to the state through income taxes but contribute the most of any group on property taxes since they tend to be homeowners according to the ftb 5 9 million taxpayers reported itemized deductions on federal income taxes in 2015 of them 2 1 million made between 100 000 and 250 000 this group claimed 11 billion in real estate tax deductions more than any other group why them asks darien shanske a law professor at the university of california davis it s hard to understand why they should be the ones to get a big tax increase a very wealthy real estate investor in texas doesn t get a tax increase and that s the arbitrariness of it right shanske was among a group of legal experts supportive of a state workaround former senate president pro tem kevin de león proposed legislation last year that would have sidestepped the 10 000 limit by offering state tax credits in such a way that california taxpayers could then claim charitable deductions on their federal filings the tax maneuver was nixed by former gov jerry brown as too complex at the same time the internal revenue service proposed regulations banning such state workarounds currently the salt cap will expire at the end of 2025 meaning the loss of the full deduction is temporary if political winds shift and there s an effort to make it permanent the professor says california may need to rethink its own tax structure if it s temporary i don t know there s much to be done shanske said if it s permanent then it is something that california has to take seriously who s getting the blame new york gov andrew cuomo has suggested that changes to the federal tax code are causing some high income earners to flee that high cost state however a new report from moody s this week says it hasn t found the salt cap is causing new yorkers or californians to flee just yet the impact of the salt cap enacted in 2017 will be felt widely for the first time this tax season and possibly spur some out migration but jobs and demographic trends will continue to influence relocation patterns more than tax burdens moody s stated professor shanske said one way to give this upper middle group relief is to raise the salt cap to 20 000 this would allow the federal government to continue reaping taxes from the very wealthy the jarvis family is typical of this band of people who feel middle class even if they don t fit the description of middle class last year the pew research center pinpointed the middle of the middle class as 78 442 for a household of three by comparison jarvis and his wife jun a buyer for a tool importing company made a combined 125 000 last year they have an 800 square foot home in inglewood to be close to jarvis work at loyola marymount university still they are on a budget the tax changes hurt us said jarvis between mortgage child care paying off student loans the credit cards look there s plenty of people in this state who are way worse off than we are but that money mattered indeed many families who purchased homes in recent years say they factored the tax deductions into their monthly finances darrel lawrence 43 and his wife rolled all the equity they gained on a two bedroom starter home in poway that they bought for 315 000 in 2011 into a 750 000 home four years later in an unincorporated part of san diego county once their daughter arrived we wanted something a little newer and nicer so we rolled everything into a bigger house knowing it would be a big mortgage payment but the interest was all deductible said the technology worker we had property taxes and mello roos fees but that was all deductible i always assumed that it would be grandfathered in i just never thought they would change the rules on us when everybody budgets for this lawrence a democrat said he places blame squarely on republicans the thing that drives me bananas about this is not only did my tax bill go up 2 000 services are getting slashed and the federal deficit is exploding he said it just feels like there s this incredible graft going on where you re taking more money from me you re giving it away to these really wealthy people and you re increasing the debt where the votes are californians could be voting their pocketbooks on this issue polling data suggested the 10 000 salt deduction along with the 750 000 cap on mortgage interest deduction factored into republican losses when democrats swept all seven u s house seats in orange county then again a state with 18 5 million personal income tax returns each household has a different experience peter antonell a 64 year old retired cal fire captain who lives in north monterey county said his partner made 30 000 more last year than in 2017 but their marginal tax rate fell to 24 from 28 causing them to pay the same amount of taxes as last year in dollar terms the federal taxes for 2018 were almost identical even though we made considerably more money antonell said the couple also made large charitable donations in the aftermath of the camp fire in butte county so they were able to itemize deductions rather than take the 24 000 standard deduction for joint filers antonell said it wasn t fair of congressional republicans to target california for revenue by limiting the salt deduction but he also doesn t like california s high income and sales taxes the new law certainly accentuates that taxes in blue states are pretty high he said as a republican retiree who left his presidential vote blank in 2016 antonell said he entertains the idea of moving to carson valley nevada where there s no state income tax if we end up determining that the tax burden at the state and local level becomes too burdensome then we ll leave he said

morrison s conservative coalition is seeking a third three year term but morrison is the third prime minister to lead a divided government in that time and only took the helm in late august opinion polls suggest his reign will become one of the shortest in the 118 year history of australian prime ministers on election day the polls suggest centre left opposition leader bill shorten will become the eighth prime minister since the country plunged into an extraordinary period of political instability in 2007 the election pits shorten a former labour union leader who has presented himself as the alternative prime minister for the past six years and morrison a leader who the australian public is still getting to know morrison is seen as the architect of australia s tough refugee policy that has all but stopped the people smuggling traffic of boats from southeast asian ports since 2014 the policy has been condemned by human rights groups as an abrogation of australia s responsibilities as a signatory to the united nations refugee convention morrison s first job in prime minister tony abbott s newly elected coalition government in 2013 was as minister for immigration and border protection he oversaw the secretive military run operation sovereign borders asylum seekers from the middle east africa and asia would typically disable or sink their boats when intercepted by patrol ships in waters north of australia so that the australian crews would have to rescue them rather than turn the boats away under the new regime the asylum seekers were placed in motorized life boats that were towed back to indonesia the life boats had just enough fuel to reach the indonesian coast the indonesian government complained the policy was an affront to indonesian sovereignty the government has also maintained a policy adopted in the final months of a labor government in 2013 of sending boat arrivals to camps on the pacific island nations of papua new guinea and nauru those who attempt to reach australia by boat are told they will never be allowed to settle there morrison remains proud of virtually stopping people smuggler boat traffic he has a trophy shaped like a people smuggler s boat in his office inscribed with i stopped these labor has promised to maintain the policy of banishing boat arrivals to the islands but labor says it would give priority to finding permanent homes for the asylum seekers who have languished in island camps for years the conservative coalition argues that the boats would start coming again because a labor government would soften the regime the government introduced temporary protection visas for boat arrivals so that refugees face potential deportation every three years if the circumstances that they fled in their homelands improve labor would give refugees permanent visas so that they have the certainty to plan their lives climate change policy is a political battlefield in a country that is the world s largest exporter of coal and liquefied natural gas and has been one of the world s worst greenhouse gas emitters on a per capita basis because of its heavily reliance on coal fired power generation disagreement over energy policy has been a factor in the last six changes of prime minister labour prime minister julia gillard introduced a carbon tax in 2012 conservative prime minister tony abbott scrapped it two years later the coalition is torn between lawmakers who want polluters to pay for their greenhouse gas emissions and those who reject any measures that would increase household power bills the government aims to reduce australian greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 below 2005 levels by 2030 labour has promised a more ambitious target of a 45 reduction in the same time frame action on climate change was a major priority for votes when conservative prime minister john howard s reign ended after more than 11 years at an election in 2007 labour prime minister kevin rudd immediately signed up to the u n s 1997 kyoto protocol on reducing emissions australia and the united states had been the only industrialized countries to hold out climate change dropped down the list of australian priorities after the global financial crisis hit but after australians sweltered through a record hot summer and grappled with devastating drought global warming has become a high priority issue for voters again the government warns that labor s emissions reduction plan would wreck the economy the coalition also argues that labor would further damage the economy with its policy of reducing tax breaks for landlords as real estate prices fall in australia s largest cities sydney and melbourne morrison boasts that the conservative administration prime minister howard led delivered 10 annual surplus budgets and paid off all federal government debt before the government changed at the 2007 election rudd had planned a budget surplus in his government s first fiscal year but the global financial crisis struck many economists congratulate rudd for keeping the australian economy out of recession through stimulus spending the coalition has accused labor of spending too much and sinking australia too deep in debt but debt has continued to mount since the conservatives regained the reins in 2013 but opinion polls suggest voters consider the conservatives to be better economic managers the government brought forward its annual budget blueprint by a month to april 2 and revealed a plan to balance australia s books in the next fiscal year for the first time in 12 years labour also promised to deliver a surplus budget in the year starting july 1 but it has yet to detail how it will achieve this goal labour has also promised to spend an additional au 2 3 billion 1 6 billion over four years on covering treatment costs of cancer patients it s an attractive offer with half australia s population expected to be diagnosed with some form of the disease in their lifetimes the conservatives have largely taken credit for australia s remarkable run of 28 years of economic growth since its last recession under labor s rule morrison hopes that voters will look to him to deliver a sequel to the howard years when a mining boom delivered ever increasing budget surpluses rod mcguirk the associated press

imfc press conference 2019 imf spring meetings 12 45 p m 1 20 p m speakers lesetja kganyago chairman for the international monetary and financial committee imfc christine lagarde managing director imf gerry rice director communications department imf mr rice well good afternoon everyone thank you for coming to this press briefing on behalf of the imfc i am delighted to introduce to you this afternoon the chairman of the imfc governor lesetja kganyago who as you know is the governor of the reserve bank of south africa we also have with us the managing director of the imf madame christine lagarde i am going to ask the chairman to make a few opening remarks i know you all have the imfc communiqué so the chairman may touch on that and then we will take your questions and as usual this particular press conference will be fairly brief as is our custom because we are all running to other things but we will try to take as many questions as we can mr chairman thank you mr kganyago thank you gerry good afternoon and thank you for coming let me thank christine lagarde for hosting our meetings at the imf headquarters we had very productive discussions over the past two days let me review them briefly before taking your questions as you see from the communiqué we agreed the global expansion is continuing but at a slower pace since the imfc last convened in october while we expect to see a pickup next year trade tensions geopolitical risks and political uncertainties are among the challenges so we agreed we need to act promptly to protect the expansion the communiqué outlines some of the policies that will be necessary to do this fiscal policy for example should remain flexible and growth friendly rebuild buffers and strike the right chord between debt sustainability and supporting demand we also agreed that our social objectives need to be considered in the fiscal policy mix monetary policies should ensure that inflation is on track towards target and inflation expectations are well anchored and we agreed that central bank decisions need to remain well communicated and data dependent we will also need to tackle financial stability risks if they emerge with all the available tools including macroprudential tools joint action was a theme flagged in the communiqué in terms of upgrading international cooperation and confronting broader global challenges priorities among them are trade global imbalances international corporate taxation debt vulnerabilities climate change and cyber risks we also welcomed christine s global policy agenda with these challenges in mind we reaffirmed our commitment to a strong quota based and adequately resourced imf to preserve its role at the center of the global financial safety net we had encouraging discussions as to how that can be achieved by the time the imfc next meets which will be in october at our annual meetings we have good momentum coming out of these spring meetings and have made good progress to complete the job by the annual meetings now let me take your questions mr rice thank you mr chairman please identify yourselves by name and affiliation ok lady in the front row question thank you my question is regarding the imf s role because the global economy slows down with some downside risks and i think multilateralism is also being challenged at some point and at this particular time how do you view imf s role and do you think china can play a role in the imf and in global economic governance mr kganyago the imf is an institution with membership and the articles of the imf spell out the role that the imf plays with respect to its membership a key value addition of the imf is of course providing analysis of the global economy and also providing an analysis of the individual economies of the member countries china is a member of the imf and like all other members of the imf china also does undergo an article iv assessment by the fund and any responsibility or any analysis of what is happening with china gets captured in that article iv report china is a significant economy and that means that what happens in china does affect other economies around the globe and that is how we see it mr rice md would you like to add madame lagarde no that was fine mr rice ok staying in the front row japan please question thank you for taking my question i am from japan s newspaper i would like to put a question to madame lagarde japan as president of the g20 meetings this year tries to focus on global external imbalances and proposes that imbalances be addressed in the context of restoring the savings investment balance not by rather than bilateral trade measures could i have your views on this approach and more generally what are your expectations for japan as president of the g20 this year madame lagarde well first of all i would like to tell you that all participants finance ministers central bank governors and their teams are very much looking forward to going to fukuoka we are very impressed by the japanese leadership by their organization by the focus they have on the agenda clearly the topic of demographics cuts across all countries and all regions whether advanced emerging or low income whether it is ageing whether it is youth dividends all of that is critically important the second topic of health and clearly pension which has a clear impact on fiscal policies and fiscal space is also a very good topic and the third one you have mentioned the global imbalances is in our view the best way to aim at this good global equilibrium where all countries can actually navigate their path of fiscal monetary policy and structural reforms in a harmonious way around the world and it is in our view particularly given that we are in charge of the external sector report it is the best way to look at an inclusive model where all countries are concerned and involved and where the level of savings and the level of investments actually determine the position of each and every one relative to all the others mr rice thank you madame lagarde the wall street journal please question madame lagarde since the imf met in october a number of the central bankers who have been here this week have been facing renewed political pressure in the united states obviously president trump has not only tweeted about what he wants the fed to do but has also begun kind of appointing people who would take the central bank possibly in a more political direction and many central banks around the world are facing pressure and questions about whether there should be more coordination between monetary and fiscal authorities i am curious are you alarmed by what we are seeing in terms of political pressure on central banks or is there perhaps a welcomed discussion that there needs to be more political involvement in how they carry out their operations madame lagarde you know what i can tell you is that on the part of all the central bank governors that i have discussed with in the last three days there was a shared concern on their part about two principles maybe three the first one was the principle of accountability and how they have to report back to who they are accountable to the second one was the principle of the transparency of the process by which they reach conclusions or decisions and probably the third one is that of communication and the ways in which they can come across the often obscure jargonic language of central bankers with no offense to my neighbor who is also a very very eloquent communicator and i think all of them were saying we need these three components in order to be credible and in order to deliver on our mandate and they have different mandates and there are different ways around the world to organize one s selves clearly when you are a central bank governor but independence has served them well over the course of time and hopefully will continue to do so mr kganyago let me add something and say that institutions in society are created for a purpose central banks were created for a particular purpose and the purpose of central banks is normally spelled in the founding laws of a country in the case of south africa the mandate of our central bank is spelled out in the constitution of the republic of south africa and there is an increasing trend anyway towards more independent rather than less independent central banks the clearer the mandate of a central bank the easier it is to hold a central bank accountable and so whilst the central banks are given the independence to pursue their mandate the flip side of independence is that of accountability that central banks have got to be accountable for how well they are doing in fulfilling their mandates the broader the mandate the more difficult it is to hold the central banks accountable with respect to the execution of their mandates mr rice thank you very much i want to take afp in the third row question i have two questions for christine lagarde please the first one is about venezuela i wanted to know if you have made any progress in recognition of the government and the second question is i wanted to know if you share the view of bruno le maire who said yesterday that the main differences in the eu could be a threat for the common currency the euro madame lagarde well thank you so much on venezuela you know first of all i will reiterate that we are extremely concerned about the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding our eyes and the fact that so many people are being affected are in their physical integrity and so many are being displaced and taking shelter in neighboring countries all the way down to argentina and we are talking millions here the second point that i want to reaffirm as well is that we can only be guided by the membership so it is not a question of us deciding it has to be a large majority of the membership actually recognizing diplomatically the authorities that they regard as legitimate and as soon as that happens then we move following our membership so we will continue to monitor that i know that there are some members who are also looking at their respective positions and as soon as that happens and we can actually identify the authorities then we stand ready to move in and help and you know sort of harness all our resources if we are asked to help together with others there were quite a few discussions about the euro area its strength and as you know we have recommended repeatedly the strengthening of the architecture of the euro area in at least two domains one is completion of the banking union which is not going to make anybody dream but it is going to give huge stability when it happens and the second a deep euro capital market that companies enterprises could tap into in order to get finance on a much broader basis so the fact that there is possibly asymmetry in terms of positioning between various members inside the euro area might be in our view what we have called the trade off between members so that one member agrees to do something in consideration for which another member agrees to do something else and therefore they move towards a deepening of the architecture we have said that all along we have published a paper recently on this issue of the trade off in order to complete some of the key projects that will give more strength to the euro area so i do not know what bruno le maire has been saying exactly but if it is along those lines asymmetry of positions room and journey towards trade off in order to consolidate we are supportive wholeheartedly mr rice thank you madame lagarde this lady in the second row you have been trying very hard i think it is zimbabwe is it question yes thank you so much i have a two part question the first one is zimbabwe i know and thank you for confirming that now you have a staff monitored program that you have agreed to with the finance minister mthuli ncube my question is zimbabwe has had millions in mass exodus from 2000 all the way through the crackdown of this last january so you have got so many people who are excluded in their values and aspirations as the structural reform program moves forward does the imf have any plans in inclusivity and in those women in the diaspora who may want to see the reforms go in a particular direction or to have input in every step of the decision making process of those reforms in particular the media reforms which are going on right now and there is a lot of diaspora women who are in the media space that was my first question my second question is with the economic slowdown that you are projecting the finance minister just the other day announced that he will be introducing a new currency later in the year i would like to know what your views are on that in the context of the slowdown madame lagarde well first of all i would like to reaffirm that we will be conducting a staff monitored program with zimbabwe and it is particularly appropriate that we do that expeditiously given the hardship and the loss caused by the recent cyclone and we will mobilize energy in order to support the authorities i can assure you that on the principle of the social protection of the most vulnerable of inclusion we will be deploying the principles by which we now operate as i have announced to the imfc this morning a social protection framework is going to come up for discussion at the board in the next few weeks and we will certainly endeavor to deploy social protection principles in the work that we do with the authorities the second point that i wanted to mention which i believe can and will help zimbabwe as well given the current monetary and currency situation if used in a smart way i would hope that financial technologies can be deployed in order to include as many as possible and any knowledge any best practices that we are aware of we will certainly make them available in the course of the weeks to come mr rice thank you very much madame lagarde i will swing around here i think we have maybe two more reuters question hi thank you madame lagarde and mr chairman i have a question for both of you it seems to me that given the outlook that you have got that is quite uncertain the one thing that is most under the control of policymakers is trade that if the united states and china were able to resolve their differences and come up with a lasting agreement how big is that in your eyes in terms of brightening the outlook and sustaining this growth by the same token if the united states decides to go down the route of tariffs on autos which would draw in a lot more countries how bad does that look mr kganyago a number of ministers and governors throughout these past two days have actually made their views well known about the benefits of trade so basically as a community we move from the basis that free trade is beneficial for the global economy there is work that has been done which actually showed that the current trade moves from some of the economies are actually having an adverse impact on the global economy and without a doubt one of the risks that we are actually highlighting as a downside risk to the growth outlook is the impact of the trade tensions and you are right when say that it is one thing if it is within the control of the policymakers except the only other thing is that it is not just the policymakers who are gathered here we do not have the ministers of trade with us but you are absolutely right trade is one of those things which if we sort it out it should actually help us sustain the momentum if you go back to the global financial crisis in 2008 the big thing amongst us was how do we restart the trade flows how do we restart the trade finance so that you could have trade at the time we could see that the volumes of trade were declining and any move now that would impact adversely on trade going forward has got to be negative for the global economy madame lagarde as a follow up to your question i will give you two numbers which i have shared with the members of the imfc this morning if you model tariffs on a large portion of the goods that are traded you take the entire volume of goods traded between the u s and china in particular 500 billion and you apply tariffs to that you are putting at risk 0 8 percent of global growth if on the other hand you eliminate only 25 percent of the barriers on the trading of services you obtain the same result except positive so minus 0 8 if you put heavy tariffs on the goods plus 0 8 if you eliminate 25 percent of the tariffs on services mr rice thank you madame lagarde thank you mr chairman last question i am going to go to the gentleman in the front row here question madame lagarde i wanted to ask you it is rather amazing that there was no discussion about greece in this meeting but we saw you yesterday chatting with mr tsakalotos outside of this room and i can say that in a casual atmosphere kind of tell us what was the discussion what was it about madame lagarde well first of all we have a very pleasant and courteous relationship euclid and myself and i was asking him how the greek economy is doing from his perspective how the fiscal policies are coming out and how the primary surplus is faring and we separately from that had a lovely conversation about the greek cinema industry mr rice so on that note thank you very much to the managing director and to the chairman of the imfc and thanks to all of you

the global economy is likely to pull out of a brief growth slump later this year with a little help from the world s central banks and from u s and chinese trade negotiators global finance leaders gathered from the spring meetings of the international monetary fund and the world bank agree that the global economy has lost momentum this year but they expect growth to pick up in the second half of 2019 as central bankers ease up on interest rates still a trade standoff between the united states and china threatens to dim the economic outlook we must be mindful of an escalation of trade tensions japanese finance minister taro aso told reporters friday japan holds the chairmanship of the group of 20 major economies the g 20 on friday said that world economic growth sputtered late last year and early this year because of heightened trade tensions turbulent financial markets and rising interest rates the imf cut its forecast for global growth from 3 6 last year to 3 3 in 2019 the slowest since the recession year 2009 but it predicts growth will return to 3 6 in 2020 haruhiko kuroda head of the bank of japan told reporters on friday that the g 20 officials saw the imf s revised forecast as highly likely but said all the countries would need to do their part to boost growth forecasters are worried about the u s china trade conflict the world s two biggest economies have slapped tariffs on 350 billion worth of each other s goods they are battling over u s allegations that china deploys predatory tactics including cybertheft and forcing foreign firms to hand over trade secrets in a sharp elbowed effort to challenge american technological dominance financial markets have rallied this year on hopes that the two countries will reach a settlement changyong rhee director of the international monetary fund s asia and pacific department said at a briefing friday that markets could falter if negotiators can t reach a deal after all also read 2 trillion wipeout waiting to happen behind debt markets rally say experts even a u s china trade deal could create new problems rhee said if the chinese agree to take in more imports from the united states as widely expected those purchases could come at the expense other countries that have been doing business with china rhee also expressed concern that china would give american companies preferential access undercutting other countries and leading to broader worries about the future of free trade rhee also said a u s china trade peace could prove short lived if the two countries can t reach a long term deal that requires beijing to improve protection of intellectual property and make other economic reforms
outlook today s data menu is more important than these indicators usually portend we get import export prices and the university of michigan consumer confidence import export prices are potentially a trigger for a trump outburst about the too strong dollar in his reptile brain he knows that if the fed were more dovish the dollar would fall given the rising dollar export prices must have risen in the latest accounting trump may use it to further his policy of grudges valid or not the consumer confidence indices are important because the market commentariat thinks the consumer is the last to recognize the global slowdown silly sods but the consumer is two thirds the us economy and once the consumer pulls in his horns we are really in the soup this seems like a logical idea but over the years we see the consumer wildly off the mark sentiment lags horribly and sometimes never does match the economic data until the ceiling has fallen down consumer confidence is certainly not a leading indicator beware drawing any deductions about spending plans or inflation expectations in march the index was revised higher to 98 4 from the preliminary 97 8 when the current conditions index component was stronger than thought at first wait a minute march was the month when the jabber about a synchronized global slowdown was getting a grip it by passed the ignorant consumer entirely we say the ignorant consumer is just being mismeasured for one thing the michigan survey covers only a few hundred persons there is no way is it representative in fact it s really bad statistics secondly it s a telephone survey remember how the pollster struggled with phone surveys ahead of the 2016 presidential election nate silver among others wrote tomes about it the only people with land lines these days are the oldsters they may be inclined to say the economy is good and deserves confidence because the stock market is up finally we want to know what people do not what they say when the consumer is exhibiting sentiment it takes the form of retail sales and retail sales have been faltering since last october other economies are beset by countervailing forces too old idea the australian dollar leads if the aud breaks out to the upside the euro is not far behind this rule really does work a little more than half the time but that leaves plenty of occasions when it fails uncertainty over the australian economy is on the seesaw there s china and raw materials but also the labor market and housing the rba claims to be neutral but locals smell a cut another old rule when you can t figure out what the economics are proposing for the currency draw a chart here the aud has old fashioned support and resistance lines indicating the latest swing up should be ending a breakout to the upside is always possible of course but funny enough old fashioned support and resistance which go in and out of favor happen to be in favor at the moment if a preponderance of traders see the chart this way the aud s goose is cooked we see a similar problem with sterling some factors are deeply discouraging like new business investment but others indicate the economy can muddle through inflation trade improvement brexit should be a heavy stone around sterling s neck but the pound is far more resilient than we think we saw a reference to the pound holding over the 200 day so had to check it out sure enough the pound has been above the 200 day for over a month the 200 day has zero value as an indicator it means nothing more than long term you can t trade on it but the lure of the 200 day persists because so many people talk about it on the chart here the 200 day is the green line we also drew a linear regression channel from the end of the downmove 1 2662 on 08 15 18 to the last high 1 3381 from 03 13 19 it s practically horizontal it s also useless because it s too wide and encompasses more than one visibly obvious trend quick what do these channels tell us about the path of sterling going forward nothing and just as useless as the 200 day a breakout below the 200 day will be shouted about but has no predictive value the point probably is that uncertainty is so high that traders are paralyzed this ends up resulting in a drop in volatility when many look to volatility numbers to figure out how to trade this morning the pound was almost unchanged from yesterday when we typed it into the spreadsheet the announcement of the postponement to halloween was already known to be sure but no reaction in prices indicates rising tension that must explode at some point some call it lethargy or doldrums but those words have the wrong connotation coiling spring is a better one we got that splendid metaphor from poundsterlinglive com by the way a may resignation might not suffice to unleash the spring with the only currencies showing any movement the yen and swiss franc it s hard to say how next week will shape up unless trump makes a new stink about trade with japan and europe we don t see any market movers that means a slow moving and sideways moving market in the euro benchmark hunker down note to readers get ready passover and good

len cabrera special to the sun tax day is a good time to consider what our representatives in washington do with our tax dollars they re clearly addicted to spending other people s money like junkies but instead of destroying their own lives they re destroying our children s futures democrats who were silent while president barack obama doubled the national debt are now deficit hawks blaming donald trump s temporary tax cuts for rising deficits data from the department of the treasury quash that myth comparing fiscal year 2018 to 2017 shows a revenue increase of 97 billion 6 from personal income taxes the corporate tax cut washes most of that out but overall revenue was still up 15 billion 0 5 spending however was up by 127 billion 3 2 the deficit increased by nearly 17 to 779 billion the problem is not defense spending which was up 10 to 665 billion our politicians spent enough in other areas that fiscal year 2018 would ve run a deficit even if they eliminated all defense spending one of the few legitimate constitutional roles of the federal government this is true for almost every year of the last decade deficits total 2 6 trillion more than defense spending since 2009 spending on interest was up 24 to 325 billion that s the cost we pay today for the flagrant spending politicians did in the past it buys us nothing and it will get worse as interest rates rise even if the government stops borrowing let s put these numbers into perspective our fiscal year 2018 deficit the amount the government borrowed last year 779 billion is more than the gdp of over 180 countries including switzerland sweden belgium and taiwan the amount we paid for interest exceeds the gdp of wisconsin these numbers may not mean much to the average american so let s scale this to median household income 57 652 according to the census bureau s 2017 american community survey if you earned the median income and spent like the federal government your annual spending would be 71 143 requiring you to borrow 13 491 how many years can you sustain living beyond your means like that the federal government has been doing it for decades racking up over 22 trillion with a t in debt that s the equivalent of 381 000 for your median household that might not sound like much for those with high priced homes but remember this is scaled for median income that debt is nearly double the median home value of 193 500 it would take your full income for seven years to pay that debt back not accounting for additional interest charges unlike consumer debt for tangible assets like houses cars or appliances most of the government s spending funds current consumption social security medicare medicaid and interest use almost 60 of federal revenue the deficits continue to add up and our junkies are in denial they claim they can control spending whenever they want but notice every proposal to balance the budget looks five or 10 years into the future these politicians are clearly not serious try taking an equity loan on your house every year just making interest payments and then promising your bank that you have a plan to start paying down the loan in five or 10 years proponents of modern monetary theory a rehash of 1940s functional finance don t see a problem because we ve run deficits for years and nothing bad has happened this is a common error of ignoring second and third order effects just like a meth addict s teeth don t fall out after a few tokes our economy won t collapse immediately from deficit spending the impact is hard to measure because we d have to compare the economy to what it would be without the deficit spending something we can t observe traditional economic theory suggests government borrowing diverts financial capital resulting in slower economic growth our politicians are hurting future generations buying favor with borrowed money our children will have less prosperity and will be burdened with increasingly higher payments on the government s debt similarly we re feeling the effects now from previous deficit spending 325 billion in fiscal year 2018 tax revenue that wasn t used for health care education roads etc raising taxes or inflating our way out of debt will also hurt future generations but our politicians don t seem to care junkies never worry about the consequences of their addictions len cabrera is a ph d economist who lives in alachua

defiant resistance the venezuelan crises and the possibility of another world latin america april 13 2019 jeremiah gaster bob dylan once said let us not talk falsely now the hour is getting late february 23rd 2019 was the day that juan guaidó the self proclaimed president of venezuela had authorized humanitarian aid to enter venezuela an attempt to force the maduro government and thus the venezuelan people to their knees there is great urgency as an ever increasing escalation of violence is being perpetuated by those who would destroy venezuela including several attacks on venezuela s electrical grid over the last few weeks but let me be clear the venezuelan poor are resilient and any change will be on their terms most importantly venezuelan politics is collective and there is a deep form of solidarity across communities along with an abiding interest in building a different form of politics in short if one does not unearth this collective politics one cannot understand what is happening in venezuela while in venezuela doing field work in july 2018 in conversations with many venezuelans i noted the consistent insistence that venezuela must be respected a primary feature of venezuelan life is that politics is not only discussed but is everywhere and as such many venezuelans could teach graduate courses in political science this is well exemplified in a recent news item on the real news network in which a woman on the street clutching a well worn copy of the constitution says to the interviewer if juan guaidó needs a constant reminder she will be happy with her fellow citizens to read him the constitution every day that a factor of everyday life is the importance of the venezuelan constitution is not to be discounted and helps us understand something essential the gravity of politics for venezuelans another core aspect of this is the ease with which poor venezuelans viscerally expressly and collectively are directly involved with politics it was not always thus pacted political system early in the twentieth century oil was found in venezuela soon venezuela s elites became capitalist rich beyond imagination and they also grew concerned that they faced too much disruption from rural and urban crowds who had a tendency toward fomenting strikes and other political upheavals in 1958 three political parties implemented a pacted political system wherein in one election action democratic would win and in the next election the social christians would win and so on while the third party quickly disappeared this pact which continued for several decades against the threat of communist organizing and against the poor eventually joined by the catholic church business leaders and even unions in the 1970s following a successful decade of pacted democracy flush with oil monies the venezuelan state started a few social welfare programs while some venezuelans began to experience a measure of relief poverty persisted then in the early nineteen eighties the state shut off the small flow of oil money to the poor and thus poverty in venezuela grew to 62 per cent and extreme poverty grew to 30 per cent in 1989 in the wake of re electing carlos andres perez as president venezuelans were hopeful however in the week after his inauguration venezuelans learned perez intended to integrate the state even closer with global capital pushing further austerity in response on february 27 1989 a series of bus and food riots started that lasted almost a week this revolt throughout venezuela by the poor against the state and society was called the caracazo in its attempt to quell the revolt the state killed upwards of 2000 people nevertheless since the caracazo the state and elites found themselves unable to govern venezuela as before rather than the elites governing venezuela the poor those who were starving those informally working other workers including the underemployed or unemployed farmers afro venezuelans indigenous venezuelans the differently abled lgbtq youth seniors women working in their homes caring for their children women working outside the home and then keeping house people forgotten by politics of exclusion came down from the barrios changing venezuela consider that for the next decade the average number of protests grew to over 1000 per year an increase from the pre 1989 average of 200 signifying that all across venezuela there were at least two protests every day during this period in 1992 a colonel in the venezuelan army hugo chávez frías led an attempt to end the state s continued repression and when this failed he took responsibility for it chávez born poor being afro indigenous recognized that the marginalized had to be the major force in any political project geared toward their particular and specific needs the revolution cemented after serving some time in jail chávez ran for president in the 1998 elections his win did not start the revolution but rather cemented it while still an uphill battle even with chávez at the helm the state itself was restructured to support communities this restructuring was unthinkable just prior to his election turning it into something quite unthinkable to us here in canada in him the poor found a friend a teacher a comrade now without him a common phrase is that chávez is a seed in all and this keeps them fighting many benefits continued to accrue to those from whom venezuela s wealth had once been robbed including huge advances in access to healthcare education and a general well being for all venezuelans especially the poor pursuant to nicolás maduro s second election twenty years since chávez s first unlike in many other states around the world that impose austerity and neoliberally reorganize state services there remains in venezuela the sense that the state must provide for its citizens significantly the current economic and political crises under such intense misinformation and international scrutiny are not the result of venezuelan state policies while some monetary inflation is an indirect result of state policies the crises are a direct result of speculation and inflation sparked by venezuelan capitalists and the horrific interventions meted out by some nations including canada and the usa such as sanctions and blockades on one hand free or low income housing universal healthcare public and universal education including the distribution of free tablets or computers to all children subsidized gas the provision of basic food stuffs to all who need it the venezuelan state s social programs remain sturdy despite the manufactured economic and political crises of 2019 when i was there in july 2018 because the cost to print urban public transit tickets in caracas was more expensive than the government was willing to make the price public transit was free of course maduro remains accused of buying votes via these programs the beneficiary of current venezuelan government policies continues to be the poor themselves significantly what has been venezuela s strength even more than the social welfare policies themselves as revolutionary as they are in this current world of austerity is the fact of community control of this revolution for they control the process through chavismo many communities have arranged themselves into organizations as community councils misiones and various other forms of assemblies the government is involved e g the government mandates that a community council is to be constituted of two hundred families less in rural and indigenous areas must meet quorum etc and then the government provides funds to the community organization based on the mandates to provide various social services and to foster community production the government provides support but these organizations are run by the communities themselves and they have done so for the past two decades presently tens of thousands of such community organizations exist throughout all of venezuela there has also been exponential growth in communes throughout venezuela in areas where several community councils intersect thousands of members in the cities less in the rural areas further entrenchment of community organizations has been fostered communes that intersect have begun to institute communal cities of 20 000 members each these institutional structures and the communities protagonism and cooperation forming them reveal the depth of the change during the last two decades in venezuela one thing is clear in all of these social endeavors the revolution is constituted through the multiple tendencies of chavismo and it is only through the masses in their work against all forms of domination that the revolutionary state exists notably chavismo is a consciously socialist feminist practice throughout all of venezuela many communities that before were denied their dignity have collectively altered their country based on principles of social equity and egalitarianism changes have been happening here that have rarely happened at any point in human history to be certain venezuela as a country remains capitalist colonial racist machista and embedded in imperialism s world the state is a state with all of its corresponding dangers significantly the venezuelan state is not the site of counter revolution even though it is a residual capitalist state against which the masses constantly battle for their gains it is not the state who wars against the masses rather in venezuela the state is with the masses revolution although new elites have emerged and problematize the revolution the revolution is neither the state nor the new elites and for sure it is not the old elites rather even though in any society in which they exist they are the fulcrum it is the poor s gravitonic pull which explains politics in venezuela and in venezuela the poor have begun the slow and long process of ending these residual conditions of inhumanity elites try for a comeback no longer rulers of venezuela the old elites after chávez s death in 2013 and with the subsequent fall of oil prices saw an opportunity to reassert themselves attempting to construct a perfect storm by increasing their economic war against their fellow citizens excluded from their natural place at the top of state and society the elites remain frustrated they have been ineffectual against the masses world leaders as diverse as trudeau harper martin and chrétien bush obama and trump and many others of latin america and the european union have also long hated the revolution there are many reasons for the imperial desire to end the bolivarian revolution including wanting to suppress the control and involvement exercised by the venezuelan people over themselves the fact that venezuela is rich in natural resources such as petroleum natural gas gold bauxite iron ore and diamonds just adds to the frustration with the revolution these leaders have contributed to the economic war with ever increasing sanctions especially since early 2015 and blockades of imported essentials such as medicine food and other goods a war that has had quite a violent outcome against a sovereign people presently high inflation is a serious problem in venezuela but significantly neither production nor distribution are under government nor specifically community control private ownership and the imperial blockades strangle the venezuelan economy making it scream an example of how venezuelans resist this problem can be seen in the growth over the last decade of urban cultivation and in their return to the land to produce what they need loyalty to the revolution is evidenced in the outcomes of the last several elections in both 2014 and in 2016 2017 the opposition held increasingly violent protests in the december 2015 election the national assembly an 167 seats total was completely flipped in favour of the opposition which won 109 seats and received almost 8 million votes in contrast to the chavista parties who received almost 6 million votes winning only 55 seats in response to the increasing violence on july 30 2017 following constitutional procedure a new constituent assembly national constituent assembly anc was elected with more than eight million votes the anc plenipotentiary by definition has more than 500 seats for both regional and sectoral representatives despite the opposition s call for a boycott of the elections the eight million who did vote is a tangible and meaningful voter expression the day after the anc vote all violent protests ceased until 2019 s return to violence this shows the value of the anc as two years of social peace was wrought even though the brutality of the economic war remained the persistent violence of the opposition to the revolution is clear and the rejection of such violence by the majority of venezuelan society is also obvious since the 2017 elections of the anc three more chavista electoral gains have been made winning the majority of governorships october 2017 and city councillorships december 2018 flipping many opposition strongholds maduro also had a substantial may 2018 presidential win with more than six million votes and a hefty four million lead over the closest rival these considerable votes are not negated even with the opposition s attempted boycott of the election the 2015 na is old news with new na elections long scheduled for next year the na itself is a remnant of old state formations contained within a contradictory process and venezuelans know this the poor are waging a war on both capitalism and the capitalist state in the name of a communal state and they know that it is only through the current maduro chavista government that they can achieve their victory while reserving their right to tell him how things should be done maduro remains their president manifestly venezuela s elites have been increasingly isolated in venezuela especially since chávez s first election in 1998 in 2019 presuming to have the right to stop the bolivarian experiment the elites started a new initiative aimed at ending the maduro government and so bringing an end to the revolution beyond the opposition s base and its reliance on the obvious trojan horse of u s and canadian humanitarian aid the early 2019 gambit of guaidó s presidency has not culminated in the desired end neither sparking violence in the streets nor in the claim of the abandonment of maduro s presidency guaidó s coup has failed at the time of writing the second week of april this failure is due to the absence of the masses of venezuela who remain the core of any substantial change in venezuela tensions remain high as the opposition claims the right to invite invasion to secure their power but this only reveals their very illegitimacy the government having consistently renounced violence has always been open to direct talks with the opposition if they too renounced violence however the elites are reluctant for they know that without violence they are unlikely to prevail the elites know that for the majority of venezuelans the opposition is worthless and the elites themselves are superfluous concluding thoughts so what can we do despite an inhumane blockade enacted over the past four years venezuelan poor continue to receive greater benefits from their government than canadians for example have ever received from ours consequently if what venezuelans participate in is democracy then what the rest of the world has is not in short the poor in venezuela are the government thus to support venezuela is to fight for a better world one wherein the poor are the government too fighting back against neoliberal restructuring of canada resisting the continued formation of the common sense of austerity resisting all of the accompanying horrors of early twenty first century capitalist imperialist states is how we can support venezuela as stated at the outset of this article in venezuela it is oft repeated that venezuela must be respected this phrase is the basis for the fact that venezuelans resist rather than simply folding in the face of aggressions by the opposition and other countries venezuelans have taken to heart the lessons of chile 1973 and both the military and the venezuelan people will defend themselves if attacked it is also clear that there is much that we can learn from them this will be the subject of a subsequent article nevertheless the positive in venezuela is still exceptional and venezuelan resistance to neoliberalism is ever more an example to us all in conclusion whilst undergoing many challenges venezuela remains the place where human possibilities have been flourishing and this expression of direct democracy will be protected by venezuelans and must be respected

chinese financial assistance which in recent years has immensely helped islamabad in meeting its pressing needs is one of the main reasons for the delay in the international monetary fund s imf bailout package for pakistan the imf s conditions for signing the deal with pakistan include sharing details of chinese loans increasing the power tariff adjustments in the exchange rate and fiscal policies and imposition of taxes these have been the sticking points since november last year said government sources however the media has primarily remained focused on the conditions about the exchange rate policy and electricity prices the imf has not backed out from its demand of a complete disclosure of all types of financial cooperation between pakistan and china sources in the finance ministry told the express tribune the economic cooperation between beijing and islamabad is not only limited to the china pakistan economic corridor cpec pakistan has launched projects of national importance with chinese assistance including those related to infrastructure development nuclear power plants joint manufacturing of jf 17 thunder fighter aircraft and procurement of submarines besides china has provided commercial loans to pakistan over 6 5 billion in commercial loans have been provided to the country in the past two and a half years alone in july china also deposited 2 billion with the state bank of pakistan the sources said that it was impossible for pakistan to share the details of every chinese loan with the imf and that was prolonging the talks pakistan began formal engagements with the imf in september last year and negotiations have continued for the past eight months making them the country s most protracted talks with the global lender finance minister asad umar had vowed that he would be able to clinch a deal during his current visit to washington but there has been no announcement so far and the minister would return to pakistan at the weekend the military establishment has already declared the economy a matter of national security the national security council has also raised apprehensions over the implications of the imf deal on cpec on april 5 three days before umar s departure to washington three us congress members wrote a letter to us treasury secretary steven mnuchin and secretary of state mike pompeo they opposed the imf bailout package for pakistan seeking transparency in cpec financing deals in october last year umar said pakistan would share normal debt related information about cpec with the imf but that did not satisfy the global lender which demanded a complete disclosure and the matter remained under discussion during face to face meetings and video conferences the sources said later in the same month the finance minister said the us had only 16 5 voting rights and the decision on pakistan s request would be taken by the imf s executive board with a 51 majority vote dr khaqan najeeb adviser and spokesperson for the finance ministry told the express tribune that debt sustainability and managing the twin deficits at sustainable levels continued to be the focus of productive engagements with the imf the global lender is seeking the details of all chinese loans for an accurate analysis of pakistan s debt sustainability in its recent report the imf has estimated that the country s debt to gdp ratio would peak to over 83 by 2023 pakistan s debt sustainability indicators have significantly worsened during the past two years some have already crossed the red line including short term debt and maturing debt within a year pakistan and china have signed about half a dozen loan projects worth 6 2 billion under cpec however the imf is seeking details of energy sector loans and financing of projects related to defence pakistan and china have taken a unanimous position that power sector projects are in the private sector with an overall debt equity ratio of 75 25 the private loans are normally for a term of 10 12 years and a grace period of 2 4 years infrastructure projects are financed through concessional bilateral loans from china for 20 years and a grace period of five years the range of interest rate for loan financed infrastructure projects is between 2 and 5 2 the buyer credit loan rate stands at 5 2 while for government concessional and preferential buyer credit loans the interest rate is 2 cpec envisages projects in various sectors with a total financial outlay of around 49 billion and 34 billion in the energy sector in 2015 the imf sought the financing details of the k2 and k3 nuclear power plants that china is financing through a 6 7 billion loan however the then finance minister ishaq dar refused to provide them to the global lender pakistan formally requested the imf for a bailout package during the imf world bank annual meetings held in indonesia in october when it gave a letter of intent for a three year extended fund facility programmeduring staff level programme talks pakistan claimed covering 80 of ground but during the past five months it has failed to make progress in the remaining 20 prime minister imran khan held a meeting with christine lagarde the managing director of the imf on the sidelines of the world government summit in dubai in february but that also did not help in breaking the logjam
as we celebratedr babasaheb ambedkar s birth anniversary we need to imbibe his important motto educate organise agitate as karl marx said philosophers have interpreted the world in different ways the point is to change it this is the most important heritage of dr ambedkar changing the world one of the great advantages of dr ambedkar s teachings was the tremendous awakening he created among dalits especially in maharashtra it led to a creation of very vibrant dalit writing i notice that dalits are very well read much better read than people from many communities they have a real hunger for knowledge they read analyse this is all because of the heritage of dr ambedkar he had a vision for a better world we too need to fight to achieve that kind of a society the capitalists have created their own vision for their advancement they are powerful they have planners and money to buy people land we have to create expertise to challenge this anti p eople vision of capitalists for example we can create an alternative transport system it can be done at very little expense we don t need those fancy expensive schemes at all mahatma gandhi was essentially an activist agitationist like dr ambedkar gandhi has been confined by the establishment to the safe custody of gandhi bhavans dr ambedkar s legacy is more active what the ambedkarite movement needs to do now take up other issues along with issues of caste discrimination like dadasaheb gaikwad took up the issue of land allotment for dalits when i was in times of india it was full of very talented people in the times group including kumar ketkar in economic times he is now a rajya sabha member arun sadhu in toi and ashok jain and dinkar gangal in maharashtra times sadhu later wrote the script for the film on dr ambedkar directed by jabbar patel all of them and other activists started the granthali non profit publishing organisation which produced the first major dalit autobiography of daya pawar called balute which became a big hit those were the days of a strong marxist and dalit ambedkarite movement including dalit panther of namdeo dhasal which was inspired by the black panther movement of blacks of the u s granthali also published an autobiography by laxman mane called upra he was from the nomadic tribes he strongly criticised marathi culture as the culture of 3 5 per cent upper class people the granthali activists were mostly non dalits but there was a good bond in those days between dalit activists and progressive marxist activists and still there is fairly good coordination in these sections the agitational path of dr ambedkar is very important today when inequalities are rising common people are under attack and there is strong need for resistance many of dalit leaders are too involved in parliamentary politics which is o k but it is also important to build politics by fighting for people s basic problems through mass struggles look at the current transport crisis in mumbai pedestrian and railway bridges are falling or are likely to fall several are being closed for repairs this causes extreme hardship to people new york declared emergency in public transport two years ago the authorities neglected public transport so badly had our authorities any self respect they would have suspended work on such fancy schemes like the bullet train coastal road and helipad at bandra kurla complex considering the crisis in public transport the pedestrian bus user train commuter needs more respect more priority than a motorist because the ordinary commuter uses no fuel no pollution causes no congestion and saves so much of foreign exchange which we spend in thousands of crores because of our import bill for cars we need serious reforms in the transport sector to give priority to the commuter this will confer so many benefits confer dignity to the common commuter who is constantly humiliated in today s system it will reduce congestion pollution and help fight climate change and save tonnes of money india is committed to reducing pollution under an international obligation providing an affordable quick public transport will be a win win situation the anti people policies are visible everywhere i was walking by the bungalow of the chief justice of mumbai high court at narayan dabholkar road on malabar hill recently on the other side of the road is the bungalow of the state transport minister diwakar raote and further beyond is the bungalow of the legislative council chairperson ramraje nimbalkar so here we have senior figures of the three pillars of the indian state the judiciary the executive and the legislature and yet though the transport minister himself lives here there is no footpath on this road which gives one an idea of the extreme contempt with which the whole system treats ordinary people this is an example of violation of fundamental rights and everything dr ambedkar stood for if a pedestrian is killed on the road it won t be suprising if our heartless system treats the victim as the offender never mind the absence of a footpath rutger bregman dutch historian made a sharp speech at the davos economic conference an elite preserve in switzerland earlier this year he said the rich must pay taxes and more taxes should be collected from them those funds will be vital for spending on real needs of people creating assets for them but the issue is being avoided it is like not talking about water when you are fighting a fire simiarly funds from motorists imposing such heavy social environmental costs on society should be used for public transport also there is a serious need to change the mindset of people look at the recent csmt pedestrian bridge collapse in mumbai near the former victoria terminus station we think bridge was needed for smooth traffic we forget that such bridges are meant for the convenience of cars causing inconvenience to pedestrians they are an insult to pedestrians we pay the price for the system s slavishness to the motor car pedestrians are far more in number they should get priority on the street if necessary the car should go up on flyover or down through an underpass like the civil rights movement which grew out of the resistance put up by rosa parks public transport is the source of another major civil rights movement with mahatma gandhi s resistance to being thrown out of a first class compartment by a white man in south africa in 1893 a train station in paris is named after rosa parks rosa parks february 4 1913 october 24 2005 was an american activist in the civil rights movement best known for her pivotal role in the montgomery bus boycott the united states congress has called her the first lady of civil rights and the mother of the freedom movement on december 1 1955 in montgomery alabama parks rejected bus driver james f blake s order to relinquish her seat in the colored section to a white passenger after the whites only section was filled in public transport people come together they socialize they can forge solidarity the potential is there that is one reason the ruling class is afraid of public transport clearly there is a need for strong organisations of commuters which are totally lacking in los angeles the bus riders unions mainly of coloured discriminated communities scored an important victory in 1994 it asserted that a dense network of bus routes is a higher priority for most working people than high profile rail lines in the city and some of the funds for metro lines be diverted for bus travel the same argument can be made in mumbai with relation to the metro system some of its funds should be diverted to the best service dalits in india could be considered to have similar problems as blacks and they could be in the forefront of agitations for basic amenities as they suffer most when bus services are reduced and inadequate they need the heightened political consciousness about public transport as the blacks in the u s showed last year during the bhima koregaon agitation best and st buses were burnt we need these public transport services most so they should not be the target of attack if dalits and other sections become more aware more active it would be possible to make the authorities to change their priorities in favour of people away from motor cars there is an inter connection between the lives of african americans in the us and the dalits in india prominent us thinker and political activist angela davis said in mumbai some time ago she gave the 8th anuradha ghandy memorial lecture on black lives dalit lives histories and solidarities i would like to link the collective predicament of black people in the us and the dalits in india she said we in the us can learn from the long struggles of dalit people in india davis said she recalled that mahatma jyotirao phule the pioneering social reformer from 19th century maharashtra dedicated his book gulamgiri to the anti slavery activists in the us she also referred to dr b r ambedkar s statement that he had been a student of the negro problem many black people in the us encountered the black struggle through dr martin luther king king wrote about his trip to the land of gandhi she added the dalit panthers was formed in india in 1972 six years after black panthers the quality of public bus transport has not improved in the past five years gone down sharply in september union transport secretary ys malik acknowledged that india needs at least 30 lakh public transport buses but has barely 2 8 lakh buses run by state agencies not much has been done to discourage the use of private transport in mumbai for example metro lines are being laid for public transport but the maharashtra government s push for the rs 12 700 crore coastal road will further encourage the car lobby janette sadik khan served as new york city s transportation commissioner from 2007 to 2013 under mayor michael bloomberg in these six years she was responsible for removing cars from times square building 400 miles of bike lanes and introducing the bus rapid transit brt system in her city cities around the world are changing their mobility playbooks says sadik khan who is now principal at bloomberg associates adding there is no reason why delhi can t do the same the world health organisation points out that transport provides access to jobs education services and recreational activities critical social determinants of health many vulnerable groups such as women children and youth disabled persons low income groups and the elderly have less access to a personal vehicle to a car they rely on walking cycling and public transport therefore improving public and non motorized transport can improve health equity in two ways directly reducing air pollution noise and injury risks in poor neighbourhoods and secondly by increasing mobility and accessibility for the poorest and most vulnerable sectors of society k r narayanan in his republic day address on golden jubilee of independence said that our three way fast lane of liberalization privatization and globalization must provide safe pedestrian crossings for the unempowered india also so that it too can move towards equality of status and opportunity beware of the fury of the patient man says the old adage one could say beware of the fury of the patient and long suffering people aspiration for car what about aspiration for ordinary people to get bus train walking space no footpath on malabar hill near chief justice house trans mini and legi council chairman we suffer injustice in many ways but one on the street is most visible to us all the time to see other injustices we may have to visit particular sites but here we constantly see injustice and that is why we must fight it to start with it if we don t have democracy on roads we may not have it in other spheres of like the streets should be accessible to all they cannot be monopolized by the motor car and motorists as political science thinker james c scott said little acts of resistance prepare for us for a bigger fight ahead geographer ronald horvath in his essay machine space argues that we are now devoting much more space to the car machine than to human beings and the car is the holy cow of the u s similarly it is also the holy cow in india in the minds of many westerners india s sacred cow has come to symbolize the lengths to which people will go to preserve a nonfunctional culture trait but india s sacred cow is dowright rational in comparison to ours he said could an indian imagine devoting 70 percent of downtown delhi to cow trails and pasturage as we do for our automobiles in detroit and los angeles he asked the jalianwala bagh massacre centenary took place on april 13 but massacre on roads on a much bigger magnitude goes on and there is no revolt the car culture is most responsible for this massacre of the innocents india tops the list of numbers of people killed in road crashes in the world this is shameful our vehicle culture is that bad los angeles is to create permanent memorials for bicyclists killed in crashes we need to show similar sensitivity we need to be as sensitive to deaths of innocents as about soldiers killed in insurgency or war considering the constant fatalities rampant pollution and exorbitant costs of ownership there is no better word to characterize the car s dominance than insane experts point out if u s roads were a war zone they would be the most dangerous battlefield the american military has ever encountered seriously annual u s highway fatalities outnumber the yearly war dead during each vietnam korea iraq afghanistan the war of 1812 and the american revolution when all of the injuries from car wrecks are also taken into account one year of american driving is more dangerous than all those wars put together said an observer yet the car remains to many the star of modern life the jammu and kashmir highway has been blocked for civilian vehicles since earlier this month during election time under the pretext of security from terror this is a severe curb on civil liberties in the name of preventing terror attack by the same logic people could demand a ban cars as they are a terror proven terror according to so many studies also because cars are rashly driven we are afraid to go on roads and the state does nothing about it thus violating our fundamental right to freedom the problem is not lack of money the authorities do not want to allot money for public transport enough resources can also be created through various means tax the rich save america yes it really is that simple so said the organizers of the first ever tax the rich conference hosted by patriotic millionaires and a coalition of other groups in washington d c earlier this month april 2019 we can easily raise resources for public transport by taxing the rich the motorists instead of taxing the rich the maharashtra government is in a way plundering public resources to finance schemes that will help boost the car lobby making mhada housing authority to pay some rs 800 crore for the dharavi redevelopment scheme is a case in point plus mhada itself is giving away grounds reserved as recreational spaces to big builders mode shift to public transport walking and cycling can yield cost effective co2 emission reduction the most cost effective urban mobility improvements are typically improvements in bus operations replacing inefficiently run small buses in mixed traffic with high capacity buses operated on rights of way that give priority to these vehicles bus stations and improving conditions for walking and cycling in public transport corridors these lead to more efficient utilization of scarce street space in terms of person movements per meter of roadway such approaches especially benefit low and moderate income households and reduce co2 while delivering more person movement capacity for a given amount of investment capital when compared with higher carbon transport investments oecd study revealed as mahatma gandhi said be the change you want to see in the world the transport sector now contributes 13 of global green house gas emissions and 23 of energy related carbon dioxide co2 emissions three fourths of transportation related emissions are from road traffic emissions from transportation are rising faster than from other energy using sectors the absurdity of the expensive metro rail system is being noticed in pakistan as well imran khan the prime minister referred to the huge debt incurred by the nation because of such fancy schemes earlier the daily dawn had observed that the government has been misleading everyone consistently on all components of the orange line train project cost number of affectees their economic and social plight and compensation an official said once the orange train gets operational it would cost a subsidy of around rs 1 000 for each passenger which no government could afford for a long time calling nawaz sharif king he said the king has left us in heavy debts as for the car culture the most significant change to our environment has not been the physical territory that has been won by the automobile although these territories are vast instead the most significant change is the dominant position that the automobile has won over our psychological territory this process has occurred so gradually that few have noticed but the depth of change over the past 100 years is profound without the dominance of the automobile in our psychological territory it would be impossible to overlook the negative externalities imposed by automobiles on society and their dominance in our physical territory as the site streetblog has observed make people conscious of the fact that they are slaves only then they will revolt we have become slaves of the motor car both psychologically and in real life in our day to day lives in our minds we give it a higher status we automatically yield right of way to a car on the road even when there is no need to do so our minds are conditioned by ceaseless propaganda created by the car lobby for over a hundred years the problem is our adminstrators lack innovation and commitment and still remain slavish to the motor car even in car dominated u s new york city has just decided to charge a fee from cars entering the business district as in london stockholm and singapore the money will help raise funds for the underground rail system which has been underfunded and neglected for years far from charging a levy on cars the authorities in maharashtra are encouraging cars with extremely retrograde decisions like not charging toll for the proposed coastal road and providing free parking for cars using the coastal road measures like congestion pricing can easily raise resources for the best undertaking the authorities in mumbai need to learn the basics from western countries and not expose themselves to extreme ridicule with their display of slavishness to the car vidyadhar date is a senior journalist and author of a book seeking democratization of street life and transport
prime minister mia amor mottley says government has endeavoured to share the burden across various sectors as she works at getting the country back on track speaking during a panel discussion at the council for foreign relations during the spring meetings of the world bank group and the international monetary fund held in washington dc pm mottley told those gathered of the barbados economic recovery and transformation bert plan which she said is designed to help the country emerge from the lost decade ten months ago we inherited a government that had the third largest debt to gdp in the world after japan and greece at 174 per cent we had foreign reserves of about 400 million barbados dollars 200 million us we immediately within one week suspended our international debt payments and announced the restructuring of our debt we have completed the domestic restructuring we are in the middle of completing our external debt restructuring fortunately for us that only constitutes 21 22 per cent of our overall debt the pm who is also the minister of finance explained she said the burden has been shared between capital and labour rather than putting all of it on labour as was traditionally the case and she noted the burden has also been shared between domestic residents and tourists visiting these shores the prime minister explained that it was important to include tourists as they constitute as much as three times the local population and have access to the local infrastructure in the same way residents do we ve chosen to share the burden with respect to those who have gotten the benefit of egregious contracts rather than just purely coming after the user fees of those who use transport systems or other types of user fees within the system and one of the things we have determined in terms of determining our capital works programme which is limited in terms of what government can do because government doesn t only tax and spend but where we tax and spend there will be a limited opportunity because of our determination to bring our debt to gdp down to 60 per cent by 2033 that we have to become a good society she said she continued there are certain things that we have to lead the way one through our capital programme but two where we can t afford to continue to tax and spend we use the other powers that government has as part of its fiscal governance legislation regulation investment empowerment etc she said meanwhile responding to a question from the audience about the private sector s involvement in developing states like barbados pm mottley said she only recently had to remind a large regional investor that her government runs a country not a company and cannot afford to play fast and loose with egregious requests nevertheless making an apparent reference to sandals she said previous agreements struck by the last government in respect of that company will be honoured the prime minister said barbados has one asset that is its reputation the last government awarded tax incentives that were exceedingly egregious over a 25 year period fully and then another 15 year thereafter and they wanted more even on top of that and i made the point that we will honour the agreements of the last government because not to honour them would cause immeasurable consequences to our reputation and to honour them would cause a large measurable hit with that in mind she added that a joint public private sector committee has been set up to look at what is a fair decent and reasonable deal in respect of the hotel chain jrt

remember the great recession of 2008 thanks to prosperity since then memory may have faded the steady growth in the american economy is largely the result of two fisted government action by the president and the federal reserve they each used different tools increased spending on public projects can help turn the economy around it pumps money into directly creating jobs which produce even more jobs as the new income ripples through the country soon after taking office president obama succeeded in getting congress to adopt an economic stimulus that reached 831 billion tax cuts were a big part of the package along with building roads and other public facilities some went to social benefit programs new federal debt paid the bill a gop congress denied obama any more stimulus spending but later it was willing to add to the public debt by adopting more tax cuts president trump signed off on them and the recovery continued the stimulus alone would not have brought the strong recovery much of the sustained work was handled by the federal reserve on its own it lowered interest rates making borrowing easier for new homes and business expansion the fed also stepped up lending to banks so they could more easily offer mortgages and money for economic development by lowering interest rates and making more debt available it used its powers to aid the economy created in 1913 the fed has mandates to fight inflation when prices and interest rates rise too quickly and to promote job creation its moves affect all other banks and it serves as the federal government s bank making it the central bank other countries also have central banks the u s central bank is meant to operate outside of political control its board members are appointed for 14 year terms the long terms are intended to insulate the board which receives no taxpayer funding keeping it independent of the politics of the day the president and congress may want the fed to promote easy money allowing them to take credit when running for reelection they are likely to be less concerned about long term effects whatever the fed s responsibility when he was running for reelection in 1972 president nixon induced the fed chair to lower interest rates that produced a short term push to the economy but led to huge inflation that hit under president carter now having slashed interest rates and bought enormous amounts of debt to beat the great recession the fed has few tools left to combat another downturn you cannot cut rates to stimulate the economy when they are already low so the fed has begun trying to rearm itself by gradually raising rates and reducing the amount of bank debt it holds by returning to normal levels it will later be able to make cuts to help recovery in case of another downturn it has been going slowly because there is little inflation trump has promised great economic growth while he can take some of the credit for the sustained recovery he wants levels of growth that would be unusually high this year he is not achieving his goals which probably would have eluded any president or policy he blames the failure to reach high growth rates on the fed including jerome powell his own appointee as chair trump believes that raising rates even slowly and slightly hampers the achievement of his forecast growth it s obvious he dislikes the fed s independent monetary policy he scorns powell admitting he is stuck with the fed chief but keeps up his pressure powell resists resigning but he has led the fed to back off plans for more small rate boosts trump has picked candidates for two open slots on the board stephen moore is a political commentator with no academic or business background to help him with the complexities of monetary policy herman cain is a businessman who shows no understanding of the fed both have made misstatements about the fed trump s economics are misguided designed only to win him an election and his appointees both trump loyalists would vote to decrease rates nobody would worry about post election inflation the fed committee that makes policy has 12 members so these appointees could not themselves change interest rates but they could politicize the fed congress created the fed as an independent body it was meant to keep the economy on a steady course not subject to political swings will the republican senate refuse to confirm political appointees or appease trump in hopes he will lead the gop to electoral victory
xinhua liu jie the china proposed belt and road initiative bri is a very important contribution to the global economy the director of the asia and pacific department at the international monetary fund imf changyong rhee said rhee said he looks forward to participating in the second belt and road forum for international cooperation together with imf managing director christine lagarde in beijing later this month representatives from over 100 countries including about 40 leaders of governments have confirmed their attendance the imf is in very close collaboration with the chinese authorities on sharing the best international practices especially regarding fiscal sustainability and capacity building not only for chinese officials but also for officials from low income countries that have joined in the bri the imf official said he said the imf has opened the china imf capacity development center in beijing in order to provide personnel training support institution building and boost communication for countries along the belt and road the imf on tuesday revised up the 2019 growth projection for china to 6 3 percent up 0 1 percentage point from its previous estimation in january according to the newly released april 2019 world economic outlook rhee told xinhua that the upward revision reflected the combined impact of recent developments in the china u s trade talks china s stronger than expected expansionary fiscal policy and a slowing global economy the imf made the latest projection taking into account both positive and negative factors he said the forecast falls in the range of china s gross domestic product growth target of 6 6 5 percent this year which was set in the latest annual government work report released in early march we welcome chinese government s recent announcement in growth target in the form of a range not a point target rhee said i think that is quite consistent with the authorities emphasis on the quality of growth rather than just maintain high quantity growth rhee also said as china becomes wealthier its growth rate will naturally go down the imf projects that the asian economies will grow 5 4 percent in 2019 and 2020 accounting for more than 60 percent of the global growth so i can say that asian economies are still resilient and also at the center of the global growth he said rhee also lauded china s efforts to open up its financial sector and encouraged the country to continue developing its capital market to support its economic growth in the long run currently the banking sector plays a dominant role in the financial sector and china needs the capital market to complement the banking sector rhee said adding that the bond market development is a good starting point starting april china s yuan denominated bonds have been added to the bloomberg barclays global aggregate index which is expected to attract foreign inflows into the chinese bond market and foster a further opening up of the country s financial sector according to a newly released report from the institute of international finance china attracted large portfolio inflows last year with its bond market bringing in 100 billion dollars in 2018 up from 88 billion dollars in 2017 highlighting the importance of foreign participation in china s bond market rhee said it not only can improve the efficiency of the market but also is expected to serve the chinese economy in the long term as a good instrument to mobilize capital from abroad as its population ages and its current account becomes small or negative a well developed bond market will also contribute to the internationalization of the renminbi rhee said
dayo oketola washington dc the international monetary fund has criticised the government of nigeria for mismanaging the excess crude account and not saving enough for the rainy day the director african department at the imf abebe selassie in an interview with nigerian journalists after presenting the regional economic outlook on the sub saharan africa at the ongoing joint annual spring meetings with the world bank in washington dc explained that though the country had done well with the sovereign wealth funds managed by the nigeria sovereign investment authority it decried the poor handling of the excess crude account selassie said there have been two sovereign wealth funds in nigeria there has been the excess crude account and the nigeria sovereign investment authority the nsia has been run transparently and based on standard best practice and it has been doing a good job the concern that we have is about the eca because if you recall that the eca economically was set up to save resources when oil prices are high and to be drawn on when oil prices are low we do not think that the eca has been doing effectively enough job that way because you see when oil prices fell the economy was very hard in the last couple of years we feel like much better job could have been done saving enough more in the eca when oil prices were at 100 and 120 per barrel former president olusegun obasanjo established the eca in 2004 to promote savings and every dollar above the annual oil benchmark was deposited in the account the obasanjo government built up the eca to 20bn at the end of its tenure in 2007 however successive governments since after obasanjo have grossly abused the eca and treated it like a slush fund that could be spent by the president and the governors whenever they wanted for instance the withdrawal of about ibn and another 496m from the eca by president muhammadu buhari without the constitutionally required legislative appropriation sparked outrage from some states and opposition political parties recently the funds were said to have been used to intensify the fight against boko haram and acquire military aircraft from the united states using the management of the eca as a basis the imf had ranked nigeria second worst performer on the sovereign wealth funds user index only ahead of qatar in the fiscal monitor report also released on wednesday though the imf said the index was compiled using the corporate governance and transparency scores of the sovereign wealth funds and the size of assets as a percentage of 2016 gdp of the countries considered selassie clarified on friday that imf considered the eca and not the fund managed by the nsia which was put at 2 15bn as of may 2018 to arrive at nigeria s sovereign wealth fund ranking the imf also urged nigeria to sign the africa continental free trade area agreement noting that when completed the trade deal would establish a market of 1 2 billion people with a combined gdp of 2 5tn recall that president muhammadu buhari has yet to sign the afcta saying the country could not afford to go back to the days of signing agreements without understanding and planning for the consequences of such actions selassie said from our perspective we think that the afcta will help the region integrate it s been the dream of our leaders dating back to independence days and we think that it s a very important initiative and beyond politics it will have a positive impact economically like all trade agreements like all integration measures there can be adverse effects but these can be identified and policies are introduced to address those we have to look at the big picture coming to nigeria specifically we think that nigeria will also benefit as the largest economy from joining the afcta and being a full participant of that in my view looking at how dynamic nigeria is and looking at the business people nigeria has the wealth of talent and entrepreneurs that it has i don t think you have to fear anybody else in terms of competition the managing director of imf christine lagarde had on thursday called on the federal government to remove fuel subsidy saying it was the right thing to do according to the imf 2019 article iv consultation on nigeria phasing out implicit fuel subsidies while strengthening social safety nets to mitigate the impact on the most vulnerable will help reduce the poverty gap and free up additional fiscal space in nigeria selassie who reiterated the same position noted that removing subsidy was important because the lion share of the benefit of the subsidy went to the rich people copyright punch all rights reserved this material and other digital content on this website may not be reproduced published broadcast rewritten or redistributed in whole or in part without prior express written permission from punch

april 14 2019 12 15 am updated 12 15 am ist a decade has passed since larry diamond a political scientist at stanford university put forward the idea of a global democratic recession for a while now experts have been warning us of various threats to democracy economic political and social these might take the form of trade wars the refugee crisis in the west and the rise of populist demagogues such as donald trump in the u s and recep tayyip erdogan in turkey however what s taking an unforeseen precedence in this list is technology technology is posing a threat to democracy the economist intelligence unit s democracy index suggests that this unwelcome trend is firmly in place comprising 60 indicators across five broad categories namely electoral process and pluralism functioning of government political participation democratic political culture and civil liberties the index concludes that less than 5 of the world s population today live in a full democracy nearly a third live under authoritarian rule a large share of it in china overall 89 of the 167 countries assessed in 2017 received lower scores than they had the year earlier democracy has been hailed as a political system with maximum chances of reaching individual and collective glory and technology has been one of the major tools to realise that glory but tools aren t deterministic today there is a high chance of technology covertly eroding values of democracy rather than strengthening them to understand this we need to understand the five pillars of democracy these are the sacredness of the people free and fair elections to ensure democratic accountability a culture of reasoned debate and dissent free markets that ensure equal opportunity and a strong and effective state devoted to public welfare sacredness of the people ensures that the means and the end of democracy respect human beings democracy exists for the people not at the cost of people free and fair elections ensure that those who are governing have the consent of the governed the government can t be coercive or arbitrary power is a responsibility more than being a privilege reasoned and rational debate brings about a balance among the ideals of liberty equality and fraternity it ensures that one isn t compromised at the cost of the other free markets value every individual s capacity to prosper by providing an equal platform to develop entrepreneurial faculty free markets give an impetus to meritocracy finally a strong and effective state ensures the delivery of education healthcare law and order and so on it ensures that justice is done however are democracies really of for and by the people in the age of the fourth industrial revolution this age is witnessing a fusion of technologies blurring the lines between the physical digital and biological spheres it is marked by technological breakthroughs in various fields including robotics artificial intelligence quantum computing biotechnology and the internet of things technology which was an ally up until the 20th century has the potential to turn into an antagonist which will slowly weaken and may even wipe out the aforementioned pillars of democracy as yuval harari explains in homo deus humans are valued owing to their economic productivity in society which in turn comes from physical and mental abilities these abilities were used to create goods and services valued by mankind economic contribution translated into political power power tends to be visibly present with the problem solvers for long we have enjoyed this position but are we going to be the problem solvers of tomorrow with the rise of artificial intelligence robotics and so on humans are becoming economically dispensable automation is making our physical capabilities redundant artificial intelligence is making our mental faculties seem like a novice s with its ability to analyse and process huge amounts of data with reasoning and to make strategic decisions there are some cataclysmic changes coming our way it s not all bleak as the future of jobs report 2018 suggests but to be complacent and not prepare for the coming wave would be myopic stephen hawking in an interview explained the scale of artificial intelligence with a joke it went something like this a man asks is there a god and artificial intelligence replies there is one now the essence on which democracy stands sacredness of people is crumbling with the birth of a new omnipresent omnipotent and omniscient technology is our worth getting eroded meddling by means of technology is evident with the recent cambridge analytica fiasco this political analysis firm at the centre of the facebook data scandal as stated by the whistleblower christopher wylie is an example of modern day colonialism think of who the colonisers are in this incident it isn t pax americana or pax britannica it s pax technologica technology is influencing how we vote in elections facebook exposed the data of around 87 million facebook users to a researcher at cambridge analytica this was used to influence their voting by means of targeted campaigning directly based on a psychological analysis of their social media activity technology has the potential to become the modern age puppeteer for elections with its invisible strings it has the potential to make us dance to songs and with steps that controllers of technology deem fit for the election stage there is a rising tide of nativism populism and belligerent nationalism from the u s the u k hungary and such countries against india as the world comes together on one platform with social media paradoxically we are witnessing a mass identity crisis hannah arendt in origin of totalitarianism has warned that if citizens float around like corks in a stormy sea unsure of what to believe or trust they will be susceptible to charms of demagogues people uprooted and asked to live as global citizens are seeking an anchor to give them a sense of belonging this sets the stage for the rise of trump viktor orban and emotional and myopic decisions such as brexit reasoned and rational debates and decision making is replaced by psychological nudging with the help of social media there are hashtags to give a verdict rather than an argument backed by facts it isn t the greater good that these debates seek just some good for some people opinions and echo chambers replace facts and reason there is no balance seeking among liberty equality and fraternity social media may assist the rise of demagogues and the fall of democracy today free markets are increasingly being controlled by the technological giants meritocracy is being left behind for influences and controls that we are just beginning to fathom the monopolies they have created through the control of data pose a grave risk to democracy four of the largest u s companies by market capitalisation which are apple google microsoft and amazon are based in technology they have the potential to use a combination of big data and technology to gain unbelievable influence by manoeuvring modern day democracy to their whims and fancies the first two risky manoeuvres are the power to undermine privacy and control over information to see what we see and to control what we see this is explained by siva vaidhyanathan in antisocial media how facebook disconnects us and undermines democracy open graph on facebook allows private firms to collect metadata on your socio political positions and preferences aligning offers with interests this opens up a minefield for political analysts who now have clear insights on exactly how to convince you and they could feed on your xenophobia self righteousness racism islamophobia misogyny or economic anxiety what s worrisome is the scale at which they can influence public opinion for instance youtube algorithms shape what 1 5 billion people are likely to see more than all the newspaper copies in the world combined tocquavelli argued that it is impossible to have liberty without democracy but it is possible to have democracy without liberty when our thoughts and desires are influenced by the technology mega giants do we truly have liberty we still have democracy but can democracy exist without liberty the final issue is the concentration of wealth the richest are getting richer according to the bloomberg billionaires index in 2017 the wealthiest people on the planet made 1 trillion it was also a banner year for the tech moguls with the 57 technology billionaires on the index contributing 262 billion a 35 increase those topping the index include the usual suspects jeff bezos and bill gates as well as tencent holdings co founder ma huateng despite a soaring stock market and headlines depicting a booming economy the poorest are getting poorer the fear that accompanies this trend is our democracies turning into plutocracies the rich tend to hold more political power the danger today with this kind of unprecedented income inequality is that the power of technology billionaires is used to influence policies that further increase their economic power ultimately an exponential vicious cycle of disempowered masses and empowered individuals is created data aren t democratised it is extracted it is stored it is used by a select few to influence a plethora of minds it ensures the welfare of its citizens it taxes spends polices regulates represents and mediates for its people however the efficacy of the state is diminishing in a myriad ways owing to technology with the spread of blockchains and cryptocurrency governments financial powers may wither away the economy works as a four layered functionary at the bottom layer of our economy are the people doing all the actual work the second layer on top of the first is the abstraction we call corporations which is a way to organise our economy and optimise transaction costs the layer above that would be banks which handle money for corporations and individuals holding the middleman gatekeeper position finally the topmost layer is the government which takes advantage of the banks gatekeeper position to siphon off taxes to fund itself and the governmental services in other words layer four completely depends on layer three for its operations or at least for the relative simplicity of funding its operations now what cryptocurrency does is to erode the need for banks cutting them out of the loop entirely making them redundant this creates a vacuum between the functional part of the economy the people and the corporations and the governments which want funding fiscal capacity spending and especially taxation is key to long term economic development taxation is not just about financing expenditure it is the economic glue that binds citizens to the state in a two way accountability relationship the mass adoption of bitcoin would lead to governments losing their power to control fiscal policy the chances of what fukuyama calls low level equilibrium will possibly arise where poor quality government breeds distrust among citizens who in turn withhold compliance and resources necessary for governments to function effectively cryptocurrency could cripple the financial power of the state secondly with the rising incidence of hacking cyber robberies and cyber bullying the state is gaining easy access to more snooping and surveillance into citizens digital footprints in the novel nineteen eighty four 1949 by george orwell the thought police thinkpol are the secret police of the superstate oceania who discover and punish thoughtcrime personal and political thoughts unapproved by the party will technology lead to the state devising thinkpols to assert control this again could mean compromising the privacy of individuals thirdly big data and predictive policing will institutionalise biases and coerce people with regard to their opinions according to a recent article in scientific american in china deep learning algorithms enable the state to develop its citizen score this uses people s online activity to determine how loyal and compliant they are and whether they should qualify for jobs loans or entitlement to travel to other countries combine this level of monitoring with nudging technologies tools designed subtly to change people s opinions and responses and you develop a system that moves towards complete control in his paper on democratic recession larry diamond asked why have freedom and democracy been regressing in many countries the most important and pervasive answer is in brief bad governance we imagine democracies to go down at the hands of men with guns but they can also go down quietly via elected governments who slowly remove institutional handrails technology might just be enabling that so where do we go from here to dissociate from technology is definitely not the way forward to go on with technology unregulated and unchecked is to tear apart our pillars of democracy we need an alternative a new manifesto to deal with technology and democracy together the important thing to realise is that either we will own technologies or they will own us the challenge as charles mackay has argued is that men think in herds they go mad in herds while they recover their senses slowly one by one with the same technology of steam engines we had communism fascism and also liberal democracy we need to collectively prepare for the challenge that technology poses to democracy for the sake of democracy the author took his b e in electronics and telecommunication from mumbai university and is pursuing a post graduate course in public policy at takshashila university bengaluru

there is a reason why alexandria ocasio cortez has become the face of the democratic party with almost childlike innocence she challenges institutions in a way that is completely new for left of center politicians why should anyone be a billionaire if the country is so rich why do people work so many hours why can t everybody have higher wages advertisement all these questions have been studied by real economists of course but aoc s naïve approach to public policy leaves no doubt that she couldn t care less what economists think if aoc is the voice of the left new york times writer paul krugman is its brain as the newspaper frequently boasts he is not only an economist he has won a nobel prize in the subject but here is the catch krugman rarely ever attempts to introduce readers to the economic way of thinking day after day in column after column he reinforces the view that left wingers don t need to read textbooks or study economic models their gut instincts will do just fine for hollywood types who think the only reason there is poverty in the world is because of greedy capitalists manipulating a corrupt system and that all the world really needs is love krugman is a godsend he never says these things of course no economist would but he encourages his readers to think that way like religious zealots who yearn to escape the laws of nature and the laws of logic there are legions on the left who yearn to escape the laws of economics krugman is like a secular priest who absolves the parishioners of the sin of having strong passions about subjects they know nothing about but let s start with the basics there are two things you need to know about the left in most cases they not only don t know any economics they reject all of the discipline s main conclusions you ve probably heard a lot about climate science deniers on the right from the mainstream media what you rarely see in any news story is a discussion of economic science deniers for example the typical delegate to the democratic national convention believes that if a price is too high the government should force it down and nothing bad will happen if electricity becomes so expensive people can t afford to heat their homes or if the price of gasoline is so high people can t afford to drive to work or if rents are so high people can t afford a place to live there is one obvious answer price controls democratic politicians tend to be very selective about which prices to control free health care and free college education for all for example but if you polled the democratic base you would probably discover they believe almost everything should be free and if not free certainly priced low enough so that almost any family could easily buy it conversely if a price is too low the government should force it up and again nothing bad will happen the typical left winger believes that the only reason there is poverty is because selfish employers pay low wages the solution make every wage a living wage and not just in this country they believe there would be no world poverty if every employer on the planet were forced to pay a living wage wages and prices should adjust to needs not the other way around the second thing you need to know about the left is that it is intellectually bankrupt one hundred years ago socialism was considered a serious idea one debated in scholarly academic circles but no more if the twentieth century taught us anything it is that the left was wrong about every single collectivist idea socialism communism fascism and any other version of collectivism you can think of because of collectivist ideas millions of people were imprisoned tortured and killed by their own governments advertisement by the time we reached the end of the century serious people everywhere turned to the right for policy ideas privatization deregulation the flat tax personal social security accounts school choice and many more innovations were instituted in countries around the globe in fact the entire public policy arena for the last half century has been almost exclusively focused on ideas coming from the right almost no idea worth seriously considering has come from the left of the political spectrum combine the absence of ideas that make economic sense with the belief that economic sense isn t necessary anyway and you get well you get aoc s green new deal krugman knows something all economists know if there is a reason to do anything about global warming by far the most sensible and most efficient option is a carbon tax that would encourage everyone to conserve in ways that cause the least amount of harm but krugman usually gives short shrift to ideas that make sense all too often he implicitly gives aid and comfort to every silly environmental idea californians can come up with and the silliest idea of all is aoc s she rejects the price system entirely carbon emissions should be reduced to zero by command and control she says how she wants to achieve that goal would cost many times the size of our gdp krugman rails about global warming in column after column and usually ignores why markets provide the best way to address it aoc is fine with that because she hates the idea of markets anyway advertisement so krugman effectively ends up as a feckless propagandist for an approach that would produce economic disaster a founder of greenpeace for example says that under the green new deal half the people in the world would starve to death and in search of alternative sources of fuel people would burn down all the world s forests that s the state of leftwing thinking in the united states of america

washington as soon as the federal reserve chairman jerome h powell finished speaking at his december news conference it was clear even to him that he had blown it stocks were tumbling analysts worried that the fed was steering the economy into recession and president trump was furious four months later mr powell and the fed have mostly repaired the damage ending a steady march of interest rate increases and signaling that their next policy move may well be a rate cut if the economy continues to soften markets have rallied and recession fears have cooled but one challenge has only worsened for mr powell mr trump and his escalating anger at the fed the president s relentless attacks on the central bank which he blames for slowing united states economic growth are putting mr powell in a bind as he tries to bolster the economy without feeding fears that he is buckling under political pressure and damaging the integrity of an independent fed publicly and privately mr powell rejects any suggestion that mr trump has influenced his or the fed s actions mr powell said this year that he would not resign if the president asked him to associates say he is prepared to fight any attempt by mr trump to try to fire him
by leika kihara washington reuters japanese finance minister taro aso on saturday pledged to global finance leaders that tokyo will forge ahead with a scheduled sales tax hike in october even as weakening global growth darkened the outlook for the export reliant economy there is simmering speculation prime minister shinzo abe may put off the twice postponed increase in the sales tax as he faces an upper house election later this year amid increasing signs of weakness in the economy the premier has repeatedly said the hike will proceed this time unless japan is hit by a shock to the scale of the collapse of lehman brothers in 2008 aso made no such qualification in pledging to hike the rate we will increase the consumption tax rate from 8 percent to 10 percent this october aso said in a statement delivered to the international monetary fund s steering committee through this tax rate hike we will not only achieve fiscal consolidation over the medium to long term but also realize inclusive growth by using some of the proceeds to provide free early childhood education while the slowdown in global growth is weighing on japan s economy its fundamentals remain robust as a tight job market and strong corporate earnings underpin private consumption and capital expenditure aso said the japanese economy as a whole continues to recover moderately primarily led by domestic demand he said raising the sales tax rate is considered important for japan to rein in its huge public debt which is twice the size of its economy and pay for the rising cost of financing welfare for a rapidly aging population the imf has proposed that japan should increase fiscal spending instead of putting off the tax hike if risks to the economy materialize a recent reuters poll showed most economists expect japan to go ahead with the higher levy

mexican stock exchange in 2012 the move is part of efforts to focus more on emerging economies while cutting costs to counter squeezed margins in mature european markets advertisement advertisement while record low interest rates have prevailed across the euro zone for the past 10 years benchmark rates in mexico stand at 8 25 the highest since the 2008 global financial crisis the mexico deal will also bring santander head to head with spain s second largest bank bbva which makes about 40 of its earnings from mexico the deal is an opportunity to gain exposure to a diversified global bank with growing and more predictable results than those of comparable peers chairwoman ana botin told shareholders at santander s annual general meeting earnings from mexico are expected to rise to 10 of group profit up from 8 botin said latin america as a whole accounts for 43 of the spanish bank s earnings at least one investor bill kanko president of black creek investment management took a dim view of the plan the canadian asset manager is the fourth largest investor in banco santander mexico excluding the parent according to refinitiv data this is a squeeze out or take under and we have little recourse kanko said he said santander s offer carried only a small premium that did not fully compensate minority shareholders whose investments he said subsidized a spending program that started in 2017 banco santander mexico said in 2016 it would invest 736 million in branches and technology kanko said that had depressed earnings in the short term but made sense to us longer term the

an aborted process to hire italian banker andrea orcel as chief executive in an unusual u turn on such a major appointment the bank said in january that it could not meet his pay expectations it s a

washington observing that the global financial crisis has exposed several limitations of conventional and unconventional monetary policy tools reserve bank of india rbi governor shaktikanta das said friday here that monetary economics in emerging markets needs a rethink this includes challenging the conventional wisdom of modern central banks to hike or reduce their interest rates by 25 basis points or multiples thereof das said in a special address delivered on the sidelines of the annual spring meetings of the international monetary fund and world bank highly appreciated by the audience for his call for out of the box thinking to address monetary policy challenges of the 21st century das said the unconventional policies of advanced economies have resulted in risks and spillovers for the emerging markets in his speech titled global risks and policy challenges facing emerging market economies das observed that the global financial crisis has exposed several limitations of conventional and unconventional monetary policy tools in despair some have turned to the heterodox evolution of ideas that are being practiced as modern monetary theory he noted in the end monetary policy must touch the real economy spur investments and maintain monetary and financial stability asserted das the time has come to think out of the box including by challenging the conventional wisdom he told the packed auditorium one thought that comes to my mind is that if the unit of 25 basis points is not sacrosanct and just a convention monetary policy can be well served by calibrating the size of the policy rate to the dynamics of the situation and the size of the change itself can convey the stance of policy the rbi governor said for instance if easing of monetary policy is required but the central bank prefers to be cautious in its accommodation a 10 basis points reduction in the policy rate would perhaps communicate the intent of authorities more clearly than two separate moves one on the policy rate wasting 15 basis points of valuable rate action to rounding off and the other on the stance which in a sense binds future policy action to a pre committed direction he said likewise in a situation in which the central bank prefers to be accommodative but not overly so it could announce a cut in the policy rate by 35 basis points if it has judged that the standard 25 basis points is too little but its multiple that is 50 basis points is too much this approach can also be useful when the central bank is on a tightening mode and potentially help avoid policy turnaround from forward guidance via stance too far into the future which in a highly volatile global scenario may not even be a year das pointed out das also said central banks have to interact closely with financial markets for transmission of monetary policy impulses in this context ensuring a sound and efficient payment and settlement system is a pre requisite he noted

finance ministers bank governors and their staff gather for a g 20 meeting at the imf and world bank s 2019 annual spring meetings in washington on april 12 photo reuters the risk that global economic growth could slow more than expected spurred a call on friday from top finance officials for countries to overcome trade differences and opt for multilateral cooperation and timely policy action policymakers from the group of 20 industrialized countries are worried that the weakness evident in key economies could spread especially if elevated trade tensions such as those between the united states and china escalate further the balance of risks remains skewed to the downside japanese finance minister taro aso said at a news conference following a meeting of g20 finance ministers and central bankers we recognize the risk that growth prospects might deteriorate if weakening in key economies feed into each other aso s remarks dovetail with those of other officials gathered in washington for the spring meetings of the world bank and international monetary fund many of whom fret that self inflicted wounds from protectionist trade policies are to blame for the weakness the week s proceedings kicked off with another downgrade of global growth estimates from the imf bank of japan governor haruhiko kuroda emphasized the need for countries to take steps to foster a more dynamic global economy there was a shared understanding among the g20 members that each country needs to take timely policy action kuroda said at the news conference as the chair country of this year s g20 proceedings japan wants to deepen talks on global imbalances an effort to divert washington s attention from bilateral trade imbalances and stave off us pressure to negotiate two way trade deals german finance minister olaf scholz speaking at an event on the sidelines of the meetings in washington said the rules based order of multilateralism is increasingly under threat and leaders must uphold international cooperation scholz called on the united states to overcome trade differences with europe which erupted again this week when us president donald trump threatened to impose tariffs on 11 billion worth of european union products including commercial aircraft i believe this is a matter of principle it s not just about achieving some short term economic gain it s not about the art of the deal scholz said in reference to the best selling business advice book credited to trump scholz s consternation is understandable given the global downshift in growth is most evident at the moment in europe where the outlook has been further clouded by the uncertainty over britain s departure from the european union an internal european central bank model presented to policymakers on wednesday indicates euro zone growth was just above 0 2 percent in the first three months of the year and could be somewhat weaker in the second quarter two sources told reuters on friday the trump administration was also at odds with other imf stakeholders on the need to boost the global lender s resources and update its governance although it does support extending a portion of the imf s 254 billion crisis fund treasury secretary steven mnuchin repeated the us opposition to increasing overall funding and shareholding quotas likely meaning the effort to lift imf funding and reshuffle voting rights was a dead issue at this week s meetings the voting quotas were last altered nearly a decade ago in our view the imf currently has ample resources to achieve its mission and countries also have considerable complementary resources should a crisis emerge mnuchin said in a statement for the imf s steering committee meeting that was posted on the imf s website on friday without us backing for an update to the imf s stakeholding weights there was little prospect for a change at this week s meetings there is no majority in sight for any changes regarding imf quotas a german official said on condition of anonymity the imf s last quota increase was agreed in 2010 boosting the shareholding and influence of major emerging markets including china and brazil the imf has current total lending capacity of about 1 trillion including the new arrangements to borrow crisis fund that was greatly expanded in 2009 at the depths of the last financial crisis that fund is set to expire in november 2022 mnuchin said it was important for the imf to maintain sufficient financial resources to respond to potential crises british finance minister philip hammond expressed concern the lack of a funding boost could hamper the imf s ability to step in to help venezuela respond to its worsening humanitarian and economic crisis this set of meetings is crucial to the debate about imf quotas and funding for the imf hammond said we all anticipate that as events unfold in venezuela at some point there will be a need for a major program to support venezuela so the uk is very keen to ensure that the imf in particular is properly funded oil rich venezuela is embroiled in political and economic turmoil as socialist president nicolas maduro battles to retain power in the face of us and western powers backing of opposition leader juan guaido imf and world bank shareholders meanwhile are still undecided on whether to recognize guaido as the south american nation s leader
