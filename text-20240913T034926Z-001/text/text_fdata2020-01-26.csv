the genesis it is now almost three years since the trump administrationâ s opening tariff salvo in april 2017 targeting an estimated 5 6 billion of canadian soft lumber in retrospect 2017 was a watershed year not for tariffsâ but for pitted partisan battles over a leftover vacancy on the supreme court the repeal of the affordable care act government deregulation and tax cutsâ a tumultuous year by most measures it was really not until january 2018 that the trump administration showed its hand on its novel approach to international trade abandoning almost 80 years of constructing multilateral infrastructural solutions to trade disputes between nations in the post wwii years candidate trump was long winded in his contempt for multilateralism from the north american free trade agreement nafta to the unratified trans pacific pact tpp to the regulatory oversight of the world trade organization wto multilateral trade agreements and regulatory oversight would be duly replaced by a unilateral approach between the us and its trading partners tariffs or the threat of tariffs would offer up a blitzkrieg body punch setting the tone for the negotiations that were to follow employing the rarely used section 201 of the trade act of 1974 the us targeted washing machines and solar panels moving quickly to steel and aluminum through the equally rarely used section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 this time tariffs were justified under the guise of either national security or under section 301 of the trade act 1974 against unfair trade practices that dealt with intellectual property and the forceable transfer of technology about 370 billion in chinese imports came under section 301 and about 359 billion in vehicles and car parts from canada mexico the eu and japan fell under the section 232 it is a vivid rewrite of the post wwii rules of engagement prioritizing narrowly defined interests while maximizing forward leverage in august steel and aluminum tariffs were used against turkey over the countryâ s detention of an american pastor in march 2019 the trump administration stripped both india and turkey of preferential market access effectively increasing duties on each countryâ s exports to us market by october thailand was added to that list in december the trump administration proposed 2 9 billion of tariffs on french wine cheese handbags and other goods for franceâ s digital services tax that purportedly targeted us technology companies the month also saw tariffs proposed for argentina and brazil with each country being accused of currency manipulation in august it was china who was officially tagged with the opprobrium under section 301 of the omnibus trade and competitiveness act 1988 the on shore renminbi had broken the psychologically important rmb7 threshold against the dollar closing at rmb7 0481 on the 5th of august during the month the renminbi faced the steepest selloff in a quarter century as the currency weakened to rmb7 2 to the dollar chinaâ s 3rd quarter gdp growth fell to a three decade low by summerâ s end 360 billion of us tariffs on chinese goods was online through the end of september the renminbi had fallen 4 5 against the dollar the renminbi clawed back strength in the final quarter down 1 2 against the dollar on the year the renminbiâ s rebound was further helped along in the new year by the rmb3 23 trillion loaned by chinese banks in january to meet bonus schedules to workers before the lunar new year at the end of the month by fridayâ s market close the renminbi had strengthened to rmb6 9178 to the dollar the us treasury quietly removed the designation last week days before the signing of phase one of the us china trade deal china announced retaliatory tariffs on us exports in april of 2018 while the eu canada and mexico followed suit in june and july china targeted aluminum pork and agricultural commodities such as soybeans and wheat while the eu mexico and canada targeted steel and aluminum and other agricultural products the precedence there is no post wwii example of an advanced economy erecting tariffs to the level of those put into place by the us in 2018 19 complicating the matter the impact of tariffs on global supply chains that international companies have spent billions of dollars setting into place over the past decade also holds no comparable post war precedence the international monetary fund has cut its global economic growth projection for 2020 to 3 3 for 2020 a modest increasing from the 2 9 growth in 2019 on increasing global trade volume in 2020 after falling to 1 yoy in 2019 economic growth in 2020 could further be augmented by the 71 interest rate cuts enacted by 49 central banks for the most coordinated worldwide monetary policy response since the global financial crisis the federal reserve accounted for three of that total in addition the fed brought its balance sheet unwind that began in october 2017 to a screeching halt and is now buying 60 billion of treasury bills of durations of less than 12 month in an attempt to place a floor beneath the repo market us asset prices have responded favorably since the fedâ s 11 october announcement the s p 500 is up 13 31 through fridayâ s market close 17 january the yield on the 10 year treasury note has risen 3 41 over the same period the fedâ s actions and the possible lessening of tensions as a result of wednesdayâ s phase one agreement on trade between the us and china have investors visibly taking on more market risk still headwinds to growth shade to the downside as current growth projections remain highly tentative in scope and subdued in context particularly when compared with the last decade there is a good deal of existing research documenting the negative impact of tariffs on the greater economyâ higher input prices from supply chain disruptions decline in capital investment due to economic uncertainty declining market valuations of affected companies lost jobs and eventually higher prices for the end users consumers for manufacturing rising input costs and retaliatory tariffs from targeted countries place upward price pressures on intermediate and final goods pricing undermining market share vis ã vis non tariffed competitors in global markets rising producer prices are a direct outgrowth of rising input costs accentuated further by supply channel disruptions as companies scurry to circumvent tariff restrictions eroding market share comes at the cost of jobs and sundry cost cutting measures by the tariffed firm to reclaim lost market share over time economic growth suffers curiously the trump tariffs were justified at least in part as a protective measure for us manufacturers against unfair trade practices of the countryâ s international trading partners particularly china another overriding justification was to finally do something about the ever ballooning us trade deficit also targeting china who owned the biggest and most persistent trade surplus with the us just how are these justifications holding up to the costs of the administrationâ s tariff regimes the target throughout much of 2017 durable manufacturing was on a tear the mean capacity utilization for manufacturing for the year 2012 100 was 76 46 new orders started the year at 223 billion on their way to 262 billion by september 2018 a year later new orders have contracted for the fifth straight month to a reading of 46 8 through the end of december factory capacity utilization for 2018 rose to 78 79 by the end of 2019 capacity utilization had fallen back to 77 77 manufacturing employment expanded in sync bulking up from 12 4 million in january to 12 7 million over the same period since july manufacturing employment has been in a steady decline posting a reading of 45 1 in decemberâ its fifth consecutive monthly decline in 2018 manufacturing added 264 000 jobs through the end of 2019 that total as dropped to 46 000 jobs created decemberâ s manufacturing count dropped by 10 000 jobs real output in the us manufacturing sector through the end of the 1st quarter of 2017 grew by 1 5 yoy 2 8 yoy in the 2nd quarter 1 9 yoy in the 3rd quarter and 2 7 yoy in the 4th quarter real output grew by 2 4 in the 1st quarter of 2019 2 2 yoy in the 2nd quarter 3 6 in the 3rd quarter and 2 5 yoy in the 4th quarter by the 3rd quarter of 2019 real output had fallen to 0 5 yoy real output had fallen 86 from the 3rd quarter 2018 to the 3rd quarter 2019 manufacturing pmi has fallen from a reading of 56 6 in january 2019 to a reading of 47 2 logged in december a 16 6 drop in 12 months the producer price index ppi for us durable consumer goods 2015 100 for january 2017 came to 101 43 by december the ppi index was up to 102 77 for an annualized growth rate of 0 11 for the period in january 2018 the ppi was 102 71 rising to 104 44 for an annualized growth rate of 0 14 for the periodâ up just over 27 out of the gate us tariffs focused almost exclusively on machinery and capital goods purchased by businesses in effect shielding consumers from increased costs due to tariffs these tariffs were paid by us importers the impact on ppi comes from intermediate good manufacturers with a large share of imported inputs higher input costs due to tariff duties give manufacturing firms several options reduce finished good markups absorb higher costs via lower margins or pass higher costs to the end user survey results conducted by the federal reserve bank of new york revealed that 79 of manufacturers and surprisingly 60 of service firms stated that tariffs had increased their input costs of that number 14 of manufacturers and 12 of service firms stated that their input costs had increased significantly over the past year meanwhile the average annualized industrial capacity for durable goods increased in the 2017 2019 period from 136 62 to 141 13 2012 100 the measure for capacity utilization for the period was more mixed increasing from 76 46 2017 to 78 74 2018 only to drop in 2019 to 77 77 in 1997 capacity utilization was 83 04 capacity utilization has been falling at an annualized rate of 3 for the period the slowdown spilled directly into the transportation sector hitting railroads dependent on the transport of agricultural commodities industrial equipment durable goods like cars petroleum and its byproducts as well as coal for both domestic use and export freight volumes fell 7 9 in december yoy for the largest drop since october 2009 the entirety of freight volumes were negative yoy in 2019 as a result warehouse and transportation employment weakened significantly shedding 10 000 jobs in december alone the industry added about 57 000 jobs throughout the course of 2019 about a quarter of the 216 000 jobs added in 2018 a similar picture emerges in manufacturing losing 12 000 jobs in december while creating just 46 000 for the entire year against 264 000 created in 2018 the cumulative hit to gross output due to the administrationâ s tariff regime over the past two years is difficult to project at the same time the share of the workforce in labor unions fell to 10 3 down from 20 1 in 1983 private sector union workers number 6 2 of the labor force through the end of 2019 the uncertainty there are simply too many unknowns regarding precisely how economic growth would otherwise have shaped up had the tariffs not been in place some of those unknowns for 2020 include the november elections and possible us tariffs on foreign car imports from europe japan and south korea britain france and italy are proposing digital taxes that could invite us retaliatory response unlike china europe is less vulnerable to us duties as us exports to europe are three times the volume currently bound for china this offers up plenty of targetable goods for eu retaliatory duties with 2020 being an election year new trade deals or tariffs placements present enormous challenges from a variety of fronts in 2003 george w bush instated tariffs on european steel the eu struck back with retaliatory duties on florida orange juice bush finally relented florida is an important electoral swing state current estimates on gdp hits abound for the tariffs already in place the congressional budget office estimated gdp at 0 3 percent smaller through the end of 2020 the tax foundation hazards the hit to long term gdp growth at 0 55 adding the loss to wages at 0 37 a recent study from the university of california los angeles puts the long term gdp hit at 51 billion or 0 27 and from the world economic forum in davos switzerland the imf posits that us china trade tensions accounted for about an 0 5 hit to global gdp down from 0 8 in october through the end of 2016 the us trade deficit in goods and services came to 504 8 billion a year later that deficit came to 550 1 billion by the end of 2018 the us trade deficit was 627 7 billion for a 7 53 annualized growth rate over the period using the same reporting period chinaâ s share of the us trade deficit came to 347 billion through the end of 2016 that total increased to 375 6 billion through the end of 2017 by the end of 2018 chinaâ s share of the us deficit for the year came to 382 7 billion for an annualized growth rate of 3 32 through the end of the 3rd quarter 2019 the us goods deficit with china contracted to 319 8 billion down from 381 1 billion yoy as both countries cut back on imports and exports as tariff regimes went live however the us deficit with the rest of the world rose by 49 billion offsetting completely the deficit decline with china the 4th quarter tabulations scheduled to be released on the 28th of february economic uncertainty continues to weigh heavily not only on capital investment but market performance foreign direct investment fdi to acquire establish or expand us business came to 296 4 billion preliminary in 2018 this represented an 8 7 increase over 2017 but fell well short of the average of 338 1 billion for the period 2014 2017 acquisitions accounted for 287 3 billion of the total for 2018 about 97 of the total fdi coming into the us during the year international companies in general are more reluctant to invest in the us because of the continuing trade tensions this reluctance to invest is potentially debilitating to forward growth given that international companies employ about 26 of us manufacturing workforce and produce about 25 of all us exports the goods the impact of tariffs on the consumer is more nuanced and dependent on the types of goods being exported by the respective countries china provides us markets with large volumes of specialized finished goods such as laptops tablets e readers smartphones flat screen televisions smart watches and voice activated assistants from apple microsoft samsung google and amazon substitutes for such goods are difficult to re source quickly if at all given existing global supply chain mechanics accordingly us distributors continue to find a good deal of difficulty in passing on the added costs of tariffs without absorbing the significant fixed costs of reconfiguring existing supply chains as companies redirect investment and sourcing to avoid current tariff regimes this means importers likely pay the added costs of tariffs in the form of either margins or reduced volumes of high demand import goods an alternative option for retailers was to increase the price of non tariffed goods such as clothes dryers which are usually purchased in tandem prices of south korean made lg and samsung washer dryer combinations rose quickly in response to the 20 to 50 tariffs placed on the components after january 2018 in this manner margins were allowed to remain largely the same with us consumers shouldering the added costs of the tariff regime another option for retailers was to front load purchases of both washing machines and solar panels before tariff regimes went online this is one reason why price inflation in the greater us economy remains muted with personal consumption expenditures pce inflation at 1 5 through the end of the 3rd quarter in contrast us exports to china are largely undifferentiated agricultural products like soybeans wheat corn and pork for soybeans china swapped out us production for that of brazil as us purchases dropped 89 in the october 2018 march 2019 period yoy current global soybean inventory is estimated at 96 4 million metric tons mmt through december with an anticipated global demand set at 95 23 mmt us farmers and grain operators will continue to pay the cost for agricultural tariffs either directly due to lost sales or indirectly due to lost market share us tariffs presents the country as an unreliable trading partner making the regaining of market share all the more difficult moving forward the agreement us china trade tensions are now on something of a hiatus at least temporarily phase one of the agreement was inked on the 15th of january the us will now cancel new tariffs on roughly 156 billion in chinese imports that were set to go online the 15 of december the trump administration also agreed to half the duty on approximately 120 billion of chinese goods that was imposed on the 1st of september to 7 5 while details remain scarce the agreement covers at least five areas of contention future purchases of us goods intellectual property protection the further liberalization of chinaâ s financial to foreign competition enforcement provisions and foreign exchange policy what phase one doesnâ t cover is likely more important than what the two countries have agreed to thus far underscoring the entirety of the us chinese relationship is the fate of chinaâ s ongoing industrial policyâ made in china 2025â including governmental subsidies for homegrown competitors in semiconductors commercial aircraft evs and other high tech industries commercial cyber theft supply chains access to advanced technology not to mention all the unresolved issues around huawei await future â phaseâ agreements xi jinping goes back and forth between industrial autarchy and giving valedictory speeches on globalization the trump administration furthers the muddle with a curious mix of mercantilist pursuits to lower the us china trade deficit to a shareholder based drive for profits from us owned chinese subsidiaries to a geopolitical program to thwart chinese expansionism come what may are the two biggest economies in the world economically coupling with or de coupling from one another can the us and china cooperate with each otherâ s mutual benefit while constructively managing their differences or will more than two decades of increased economic integration between the two countries simply unravel phase one is more of a truce and likely a temporary truce at that and how long the truce lasts is highly uncertain the completion of phase two three and so on is even more so with trumpâ s eye on the november elections china is more than happy to bide its time china has agreed to buy more us agricultural commodities and will continue to talk about allowing us financial companies to market their payment products in china the same tactics beijing has pursued for the better part of a year to date china will also increase their purchase of us energy products particularly oil and liquid natural gas imports beijing has promised to provide greater intellectual property protection china has even committed to buy a fixed amount of us goods and services worth 200 billion by 2021 something of a dollar for dollar bid to lower the us china trade deficit and is expected but not obligated to ease some of its retaliatory tariffs on us products during the period many of these us demands are already in place beijing dropped the joint venture requirement for foreign companies in the spring of 2018 allowing us financial services to market their wares in mainland markets is slowly coming to fruition and on currency manipulation both countries have pledged not to competitively devalue their respective currencies interestingly the us has for years asked beijing to let its currency be determined by market forces now both countries appear to be allowing their respective currencies to do just thatâ to be determined by market forces the onshore renminbi â floatsâ within a determined range which is set by the peopleâ s bank of china pboc on a daily basis there is no stipulation to change the practice in phase one what happens if the market pushed the renminbi down in value is highly sensitive for the pboc the agreement offers little or no details on the matter in many respects however the agreement appears to be pushing on a half opened door leaving an estimated 360 billion of us tariffs about 65 of chinaâ s exports to the us in place however clearly invites suspicions that something big remains amiss the trump administration is counting on tariffs as an offset as a strong incentive program not just to manage future chinese trade behavior but as a strong financial incentive to coax us internationals to reconsider supply chains that continue to rely on china this explains the lethargy of the s p 500 on the agreement up about 0 2 tellingly the philadelphia semiconductor index fell more than 1 in anticipation of this interregnum period bank stocks drug companies and energy companies will likely do well so will beef poultry hog and soybean futures without doubt us farmers took a direct hit first from lost agricultural commodity sales to china and then from record rains that turned fields into duck ponds during the october to march 2017 2018 growing season the us supplied 24 4 million metric tons mmt of soybeans to china while brazil supplied 14 23 mmt filling 83 of chinaâ s needs after the july tariff on us soybeans us exports fell to 2 7 mmt in the october to march 2018 2019 seasonâ a drop of 21 7 mmt brazilâ s export total jumped to 25 7 mmt for an increase of 11 5 mmt for the period brazil was supplying just under 80 of chinaâ s soybean needs in the 2018 2019 season while us exports plummeted to about 4 similar scenarios played out for pork poultry and corn the trump administration turned quickly to the commodity credit corporation ccc a depression era agency of the us department of agriculture the ccc funneled 10 2 billion in aid to farmers in all fifty states through the end of november combined with other usda farm assistance program and insurance claims farm income in 2019 was at its highest level since 2014 while most farmers benefited from the government largess funds were distributed based on acreage rather than actual need accordingly almost half of the ccc funds went to the largest 10 of farming operations chinaâ s purchases are scheduled to resume this year with a goal of 40 billion to 50 billion year in agricultural commodities over the next two years in 2017 us agricultural exports were worth 23 8 billion or about 17 of total us agricultural exports for the year of the 85 million tons of soybeans imported by china last year 57 million came from brazil under the best of circumstances reaching the agreementâ s two year target will be an outsized challengeâ and most certainly will come at the expense of existing contracts with countries that were tapped to fill in the gaps of tariffed us agricultural exports chinese purchases beyond that date remain largely undefined the departure the agreement to date is a significant departure from the free trade agreements the us has entered in the post wwii period rather than lowering tariffs as the building block of the agreement in the promotion of the free flow of goods and services across national borders phase one goes in the opposite directionâ and leaves tariffs in place further china is being forced to buy an estimated 200 billion of us exports over the next two years irrespective of market demand or constraints managed trade flies in the face of the free flow market driven flow of goods and services rather than exposing chinese markets to market driven trade phase one conveniently embraces the top down command driven chinese economic model long the bane of us policy makers of old to meet current agreement objectives on a similar topic enforcement of the agreement will not depend on arbitration boards or the wto dispute body the latter having been systematically crippled by the failure of the us administration to recommend judicial appointments to the body to fill attrition vacancies of the past several years instead disputes under the agreement will be handled by ongoing rounds of negotiations between the two sides which highlights the agreementâ s allowance of maintaining us tariffs on about 65 of chinese exports the us trade representative ustr has labeled arbitration boards as violations of us sovereignty both the redo of the nafta agreement and phase one do away with such boards supporting the administrationâ s move away from multilateral to unilateral solutions to international regulation and enforcement of trade agreements disputes will be decided by the parties involved and since most of the concessions appear to be made by china in phase one disputes appear destined to be decided by the ustr and the president both uscma and phase one represent a stick in the eye of the wto the lessons economists have long argued the premise that protectionism leads to real income losses for businesses and households buyers and sellers free and voluntary trade across national and international borders benefits both buyer and seller tariffs on commerce usually distorts the free flow of goods and services generally leaving buyers and sellers worst off the lesson derives from the mistakes made during the great depression we now have renewed talk of tariffs crossing the pondâ and back againâ over ballooning trade deficits and the inability of us trade policy to reduce their impact targeting imported automobiles and their parts and protecting domestic producers presents a highly visible target tariffs and retaliatory tariffs are also circling over digital taxes being proposed by britain france and italy the aggressive use of tariffs to advance unilateral us trade initiatives appear on the rise rather on the wane james b allen in his book â the great protectionist â describes senator reed smoot republican from utah chairman of the senate finance committee co author of the smoot hawley act 1930 as infinitely self confident a person that wasnâ t one to admit he was wrong about anything there is no evidence that any apparent fact any argument any introspection even faintly disturbed him reed smith lost his seat in the democratic deluge of 1932 a witness to 16 consecutive quarters of plunging gdp growth until his dying day the only problem he would ever admit to with his tariff regime was that they might not have been set quite high enough
the world bank yesterday praised the progress bangladesh achieved in recent years but apprehends a struggle ahead for the low tax revenue and banking sector s poor condition while bangladesh is poised to maintain its current level of growth in the medium term key structural reforms are needed to sustain productivity growth said the washington based multilateral lender in its review of bangladesh s performance under the country partnership framework cpf the wb prepares a cpf for five years for member countries it prepared one for bangladesh in fiscal 2015 16 in which it set some targets in sectors such as energy transport social protection education job creation health and climate and environment management the country has made remarkable progress in improving the wellbeing of its citizens the national poverty rate fell from 48 9 to 24 3 per cent between 2000 and 2016 while the extreme poverty rate declined from 34 3 to 12 9 per cent rural poverty fell substantially driven by gains in non agricultural income progress is also seen in non monetary indicators of wellbeing the average life expectancy increased to 72 5 years economic growth has been robust exceeding 7 per cent since 2016 well above the 3 9 to 4 7 percent average for developing countries in recent years according to the wb exports and remittance have been buoyant agriculture had bumper harvests propelled by a solid economic performance gross national income per capita increased from 1 188 in fiscal 2014 15 to 1 944 in fiscal 2018 19 overall inflation has ranged between 5 4 and 6 4 per cent since 2015 and declined in 2019 as decelerating food prices offset a rise in non food inflation the expansion of monetary aggregates has been limited as private sector credit growth slowed and banking liquidity has been impacted by the central bank s recent sell off of dollars to defend the taka with easing of loan classification standards and reopening of classified loan rescheduling facility on easier terms vulnerabilities in the banking system and capital markets persists accelerating exports and slowing imports have narrowed the current account deficit the country s budget deficit increased since fiscal 2017 18 but remained below the target of 5 per cent of gdp in fiscal year 2018 19 however according to the finance ministry s existing data the budget deficit crossed the target of 5 per cent of gdp last fiscal year low tax revenue collection continues to be a major challenge as policy and administrative reforms have stalled and in some cases been reversed public debt is expected to increase slightly to 32 8 per cent of gdp the risk of both external and total public debt distress remains low domestic demand growth is strong private investment is set to gain momentum given the reduced risk of political uncertainty following the 2018 elections and expected reforms to lower the cost of doing business tariff escalation by the us against china may provide a boost to exports in the short run if bangladesh can capture some of the trade diversion however the recession in european and us export markets and appreciation of bangladesh s real exchange rate would adversely impact export demand and remittance the elevated global economic risk calls for accelerated structural reforms to increase potential output and build fiscal and external buffers an immediate challenge is to address banking sector vulnerabilities revenue shortfalls and appreciation of the real effective exchange rate at the same time there is a need to prepare for tighter external financing conditions in the near to medium term given that garment occupies 84 per cent of total export bangladesh s export base is narrow posing a structural economic weakness diversification of export base is critical to buffer impacts from both external and internal shocks and to sustain relatively high growth and accelerate job creation overall volume of foreign direct investment fdi is still limited with bangladesh trailing competitors such as vietnam where fdi averaged 6 per cent of gdp in the last five years compared to 0 7 percent in bangladesh additionally reforms are necessary to improve infrastructure improve access to credit address the high interest rates boost human capital and make business regulation less onerous and more predictable the wb group has already given bangladesh 10 06 billion under the cpf for five years from fiscal 2015 16 it will provide 2 2 billion in the current fiscal year earlier the wb gave bangladesh 8 38 billion from fiscal 2010 11 to 2014 15 under the cpf the international finance corporation ifc a sister concern of the wb already provided bangladesh with 1 8 billion in the last four years the amount was 783 million from fiscal 2010 11 to 2014 15 the wb s another concern multilateral investment guarantee agency gave the country 474 million in the last four years under the cpf the lender will provide 12 26 billion from fiscals 2015 16 to 2019 20 the wbg now proposes extending the tenure of the partnership framework for one more year to june 2021 to align with the government s eighth five year plan
lebanon will need an 8 5 billion dh31bn bailout package from the international monetary fund to break its economic impasse meet future financing needs and restore growth the institute of international finance said even with the 11bn in pledges lebanon received at the cedar donor conference in 2018 which are tied to reforms that need to be undertaken by the country the new government should seek an imf programme enforce uniform capital controls to avoid money going abroad and maintain its exchange rate peg to the dollar in the short term wrote garbis iradian iif s chief economist for the mena region an imf programme could provide a framework for the needed fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to address deficiencies in the economy he wrote in a new report while the scale of the imf financing will depend on the financing needs we estimate that the imf would need to provide exceptional access to lebanon in line with other recent imf programmes such as argentina and iceland and spread over three years mr iradian said an imf supported programme could help pave the way for 3bn of additional funds from multilateral and bilateral sources he added the country needs to implement a set of reforms and take additional measures to meet its 24bn of financing needs over the next five years according to the washington based iif lebanon which is experiencing its worst economic crisis since the end of a 15 year civil war in 1990 needs to implement reforms and take additional measures to meet 24bn of financing needs over the next five years the organisation said the country s economy deteriorated rapidly with gross domestic product estimated to have contracted 3 8 per cent 2019 and is set to shrink 4 7 per cent this year according the iif the fiscal deficit widened last year and the country s debt to gdp ratio surged to 166 per cent one of the highest in the world lebanon s public debt most of it held by lebanese banks reached 89 5bn at the end of november 2019 the country s new government needs to press on with fiscal reforms that address structural imbalances and reduce the sapping of funds by the main power company electricite du liban which drains about 2bn a year along with fighting tax evasion the government needs to increase revenues while minimising the effect on the poor the iif said a reduction of interest rates implemented by the central bank of lebanon and commercial banks on deposits loans and public debt is positive the organisation said continued action on this front can improve liquidity of banks and boost confidence encouraging investment and easing the impact of fiscal adjustment it said the health of lebanese banks can be strengthened through their recapitalisation while privatisation of state assets needs to be an integral part of the government s economic plan the iif said aside from the country s main power company lebanon s central bank owns the state carrier middle east airlines the privatisation of which has been postponed repeatedly the central bank also owns the casino du liban other assets that could be privatised include beirut airport the beirut port the national lottery and telecoms operators hundreds of lebanese gathered outside the central government building to reject the newly formed cabinet while some protesters breached tight security erected around it removing a metal gate and barbed wire prompting a stream of water cannons from security forces ap proceeds from privatisation could help the government raise billions of dollars and reduce the size of public debt which would lower debt servicing payments and create fiscal space the government also needs to fight rampant corruption and improve the business environment the iif said with rising poverty and the imbalance between the rich and poor the government should consider creating a social fund that is financed by foreign grants and recovery of stolen public funds to address its debt overhang the iif said the government should consider measures that include rolling over and extending the maturity of the domestic currency part of the debt which accounted for about 62 per cent of total debt at the end of 2019 maturing bonds it said could be exchanged for new longer dated sovereign bonds possibly at lower yields in the context of an imf programme lebanon needs to pay 1 2bn due in march when a eurobond hits maturity another 700 million is due in april and 600m in june the crisis increased the yield on the country s bonds threefold lebanon was able to escape the 2008 global credit crisis relatively unscathed due to a high interest rate regime which lured more than 1bn a month in capital flows that financed its fiscal and current account deficits the current economic crisis which accelerated following the outbreak of war in neighbouring syria in 2011 slowed the flow funds and led to negative deposit growth at lebanese lenders the lebanese pound has lost a third of its value against the dollar in the black market and is now trading at about 2 000 pounds or lira to the dollar above the 1 500 peg lebanon s newly appointed finance minister ghazi wazni met world bank and imf officials over the weekend although the country sought technical assistance from the imf and world bank it has not formally requested a bailout package to date

countries as a result it virtually never stays in one place for more than one year in fact it typically moves much more frequently this gives the strategy its name the money is hot because it s considered fast moving and not necessarily reliable it will flow out of an economy as easily as it flowed in hot money investors can approach this strategy in several ways most will buy currency and keep their assets in a regional bank taking advantage of the interest rates those banks will pay others will buy short term assets such as the u s three month treasury bill this is a short term investment product with a guaranteed return making it suitable for this strategy even if a less common approach note that hot money refers only to incoming foreign capital this does not refer to exports and imports domestic hot money hot money can also refer to moving money within a domestic economy in this context investors are looking for short term interest rates offered by domestic banks domestic hot money investing moves between banks looking for the highest interest rate offered on short term banking products as with global hot money investors tend to move their money frequently always pursuing whichever institution offers the best rates advertisement advertisement domestic hot money investors commonly seek out certificates of deposit this is a less common usage by and large when investors refer to hot money they are talking about the practice in the context of global finance hot money examples hot money at time this was written the u s three month treasury bill paid a 1 52 interest rate also at time of writing the british three month libor was 1 83 suppose then that we are hot money investors with our money currently in euros held in a parisian bank we have decided to exit the euro zone due to the current negative interest rate environment here we might convert our euros into british pounds and put that money in a u k bank seeking interest based on the 1 83 interest rate paid in the british market we might buy certificates of deposit debt instruments or other forms of short term banking based investments advertisement advertisement say however that in march the u s increases the three month treasury bill rate to 1 9 then we might convert our pounds to u s dollars and put that money in a bank in the united states that would generate interest based on the higher rates paid in that economy domestic hot money trading works the same way say consumer bank offers 0 03 interest on all savings accounts their competitor neighborhood bank offers 0 02 so you put your money into consumer bank two months later neighborhood bank increases its savings account rate to 0 04 leading you to move your money to them this would be domestic hot money in action albeit on a very small scale impact and importance hot money can significantly impact a country s exchange rates and capital flow advertisement advertisement when investors begin buying up currency in order to take advantage of a country s interest rates this will have two main effects first it will drive up the value of that currency in our example above the u s dollar will gain value against the british pound as we unload pounds in favor of the dollar this will help the country s import sector while hurting exports and tourism second hot money can bring short term capital into a country again from our example above when we transfer our british pounds to u s dollars we put those new dollars into a u s bank this gives the bank capital that it can lend and invest with this can be good or bad as excess capitalization can cause inflation and asset overvaluation at the same time by exiting a country we help to devalue its currency relative to others when we sold our british pounds for u s dollars the pound lost value against the dollar this helps that country s export sector by making it cheaper for foreign consumers and tourists to do business in britain however the weaker purchasing power also makes it more expensive for the british import sector thus it weakens that segment of the economy policymakers and economists take different views on the value of this some argue that this creates a natural market mechanism for economies to draw in capital and balance their currency others argue that this creates an unpredictable mechanic as a result an economy s currency and capitalization can swing based on the whims of short term investors advertisement advertisement hot money and politics hot money investors will sometimes chase political rather than economic trends in some cases they will invest in an economy not necessarily because it offers the best interest rates but because it offers potential stability or they will avoid an otherwise attractive economy because they re concerned about political instability limitations of hot money the main limitation of hot money is capital controls for hot money to work a country needs to allow capital to move freely in and out of the economic zone if laws make it difficult to keep money in the country or to transfer money out of it hot money investors can t work with the kind of speed that their strategy depends on advertisement advertisement in addition an economy has to have the technical ability to move money in and out with ease and reliability say an economy doesn t have the infrastructure or technology to conduct electronic transfers for example if it works on an unreliable power grid then hot money investors can t work the same is true of economies that suffer from endemic corruption if an investor has to worry about having their money siphoned off by local bankers or politicians they cannot keep their money in a local account the bottom line hot money hot money is an investment strategy that involves moving capital between economies to take advantage of short term interest rates the term comes from how quickly and easily investors move their money hot money can significantly impact a country s exchange rates and capital flow meanwhile it can also create short term capital for a country advertisement advertisement investing tips you don t need to be a global financier to invest

funny money or savvy investing critics want answers about source of russian pm s wealth by todd prince january 25 2020 it is a notorious russian comedy that has been playing now for decades a career government official and his wife and other relatives are found to possess assets worth far more than what his state salary could justify if he responds at all the official answers the uncomfortable questions with claims of his relatives business or investment acumen despite their notable lack of prior experience the curtains on that play seemed to be rising once again last week when activists zeroed in on the wealth surrounding new russian prime minister mikhail mishustin who was appointed on january 15 by president vladimir putin in a major government shakeup mishustin and his wife vladlena mishustina claimed total income over the past decade of slightly more than 1 billion rubles 16 million including 213 million and 789 million rubles respectively according to public disclosure filings that are mandatory for high ranking officials the income comes from various sources mishustin s salary as head of the tax service profits from investments and the sale of a business and other assets according to the daily kommersant mishustin s declared income over the period in question consists nearly entirely of his government salary kommersant reported the couple s real estate assets have raised further questions the couple owns a house in a luxurious moscow suburb valued at nearly 10 million according to the online investigative site proekt as well as an apartment near the center of moscow the opposition media organization open media which is funded by former oligarch mikhail khodorkovsky reported that at least two of mishustin s sons studied at institut le rosey an elite boarding school in switzerland a luxury that costs about 100 000 a year then there is his sister natalia stenina mishustina she owns three residential properties including a 750 square meter suburban villa next to her brother and a stake in moscow commercial property according to the bbc citing in part nonpublic data it received from a whistle blower in the federal tax service her real estate assets total more than 16 million the bbc said wealthy russian politicians often disguise their wealth by registering assets in the names of their close relatives including parents children and siblings stenina mishustina worked for aeroflot early in her career according to various russian media outlets but it is unknown if she has been employed anywhere thereafter she co invested in a loss making moscow restaurant with aleksandr udodov who is considered by russian media to be a member of mishustin s inner circle according to the state property register udodov whose biography on his own website lists no employment until 2010 when he was 41 years old gave stenina mishustina the 750 square meter home as a gift in 2009 the bbc reported kommersant reported in 2011 that investigators sought to search udodov s apartment in moscow in connection with an illegal attempt by a shell company to receive a sales tax refund totaling 1 87 billion rubles which at the time was equivalent to 60 million kommersant described udovov at the time as officially unemployed but able to resolve many things in the tax sphere itera group a real estate firm issued a press release a few days later stating that udovov worked there as a vice president and was not a suspect in any cases mishustin has not commented on any of these reports private sector claims however unlike the typical storyline of russian government officials and their enormous wealth mishustin s script has a bit of a twist that blurs the play s conclusion mishustin worked in the private sector in the 1990s and from 2008 until 2010 in hot sectors where people were making money hand over fist in some cases nearly overnight exactly how much mishustin made during his years in business is unclear though a 2010 statement by the tax service shows he earned a few million in at least one year kommersant which is owned by an oligarch close to the kremlin recently published a scenario that justifies how the mishustins excluding his sister could legally possess so much wealth the article was later cited by state media to dispel any rumors while critics trashed it as a disguised press release by the family kommersant claims without citing anyone that mishustin transferred assets acquired during his business career including a stake in an unnamed company to vladlena mishustina upon returning to government service in 2010 mishustina sold the stake over two years and reinvested the money in conservative income generating bank deposits the paper reported citing unspecified media reports one year russian ruble deposits paid on average around 6 5 percent over 2017 18 while dollar deposits at russian banks paid around 2 percent according to russian central bank data an equal mix of dollar and ruble deposits would imply that the mishustins have as much as 20 million in the bank based on mishustina s investment income over the past two years kommersant claims mishustin bought the elite home in the moscow suburbs in 2000 with the salary from his first private sector job the home purchase would have cost a small fraction of its current value russia defaulted on its debt in august 1998 sending the economy and real estate prices crashing the apartment near the city center was given to the mishustins in the early 2000s by the government as compensation for his low government salary kommersant reported saying it was a common practice at the time it is just a press release by vladlena mishustina signed by with zero sources and evidence said leonid volkov an aide to popular opposition figure aleksei navalny dot ru boom the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 and the launch of market reforms opened the door to massive wealth for the select few who had the connections the brains or the moxie to meet the massive russian demand for consumer and commercial goods entrepreneur oleg tinkov was typical of that group importing foreign electronics such as calculators and televisions for resale to domestic customers at prices far exceeding their cost tinkov eventually opened an electronics chain store and sold the business a few years later making millions in 2019 forbes ranked him the 47th richest businessperson in russia with a fortune estimated at 2 2 billion mikhail khodorkovsky once russia s richest man before his 2003 arrest on tax fraud charges that he called politically motivated got his start in business in the 1980s during perestroika by importing computers he parlayed the money from that business into a bank that would scoop up shares of russian companies during the era of privatization in the 1990s the market for personal computers and software which had already taken off in the west and parts of asia was nearly nonexistent in russia when the soviet union collapsed profits from reselling imported second grade computers in russia were as high as 300 percent during perestroika kommersant reported in 1994 levon amdilyan an economist who studied at moscow state university alongside yegor gaidar the future acting prime minister under boris yeltsin spearheaded the creation of a noncommercial organization in december 1988 called the international computer club mkk its goal was to establish contacts between soviet and foreign technology specialists and to attract foreign technology including computer hardware and software into the country the club held an annual computer trade show in moscow from 1990 through the mid 1990s attracting the likes of apple ibm and other top u s technology companies according to contemporary articles the forum however was intended for a narrow circle of people that included top brass at technology companies on the one hand and large customers on the other namely government agencies and banks senior russian government officials authorized to make buying decisions were among the visitors and they purchased a lot willingly from everybody kommersant reported in 1994 amdilyan sometimes traveled with government officials to foreign technology trade shows underscoring his influence with agencies at the time according to kommersant mishustin a friend of amdilyan was involved in the club from an early stage during a rainy november day as amdilyan drove his daughter to school in 1989 he discussed the idea of holding a computer trade show in russia with mishustin over the course of two hours we discussed and developed plans for the forum and picked a date june 17 1990 now i can hardly believe that it was possible the club s website quotes mishustin as saying thus mishustin would have been at the center of the burgeoning russian computer hardware and software market interacting with the biggest names in the industry at home and abroad mkk however the market was rife with illegal practices with the business software alliance estimating in 1995 that 94 percent of all business software in russia was pirated after the soviet union collapsed amdilyan transformed mkk into a private joint stock company owned 50 50 by him and mishustin according to registration documents mishustin s stake was eventually transferred to his wife wholesale trade and consulting were among its listed activities though it is unclear what the company exactly did aside from hosting the trade show and then later an elite conference in sochi mishustin would eventually become board chairman of mkk before leaving the private sector in 1998 to join the tax service where he initially served as assistant to its chief boris fyodorov overseeing information technology neither amdilyan nor mishustin have said how much mkk earned during the 1990s amdilyan would go on to invest in technology companies such as takskom which would become one of five data operators to receive a license from mishustin s tax agency for a new service the russian online publication republic reported the annual market for that service was estimated at 100 million republic said back in business mishustin would work the next decade in government first moving up the chain at the tax service to deputy minister and then moving over to lead the federal agencies for the real estate register and special economic zones when mishustin left government service in early 2008 to join ufg asset management an investment firm co founded by his former tax boss fyodorov russia was nearly as hot a market as china russia s economy had been surging for about eight years amid high oil prices and its stock market was the world s best performer over that period amid the gold rush moscow based investment firms were paying top dollar for executives with multimillion dollar annual salaries for top brass that could deliver deals not unheard of the industry riches were attracting some government officials like mishustin into the private sector where they could potentially leverage their connections to boost business for instance troika dialog a moscow based investment bank in 2007 hired former deputy economy minister andrei sharonov as a managing director mishustin received 79 million rubles or about 2 5 million in 2009 the tax service he ran told the daily vedomosti in april 2010 that the amount comprised his ufg salary and consulting fees for the firm two former executives active in the russian asset management business in the 2000s and speaking on conditions of anonymity said 2 5 million seemed rich and generous mishustin they said would have had to bring serious business to justify such a payout whatever the truth about the current source of mishustin s money the end result is likely to follow the usual script mishustin will not respond to the reports he will not be investigated the majority of russians getting their information from state controlled television will never know about the matter source

jaqueline sande correspondent since 2008 zimbabwe has been enjoying a multi currency regime introduced to restore sanity to the economy after years of hyperinflation it seemed like the only solution the zimbabwe dollar had all but been rejected zimbabwe dollar notes released in the morning would be worthless by evening the multi currency regime brought with it certainty and the ability to plan into the future something which had become impossible in the zimbabwe dollar era this was a good aspect for both industry and consumers on the flip side though the united states dollar soon emerged as the currency of choice though under the multi currency regime all regional currencies were to be accepted as a means of payment the us dollar soon gained monopoly with currencies such as the south african rand and the botswana pula initially being sidelined and later on being totally rejected in favour of the us dollar thus the economy was dollarised there is no legislation which specifically introduced the us dollar as the sole currency for transacting in zimbabwe but the economy simply opted for the greenback the us dollar while bringing about stability also brought with it many challenges use of the multi currency regime meant the country could not make use of monetary instruments to influence economic activity as such the economy was being run using only the fiscal function the multi currency regime made locally produced products more expensive as compared to imported products and thus made local products more expensive this had a negative impact on the country s capacity to export and earn foreign currency the transitional stabilisation programme tsp introduced a raft of measures to restore macro economic stability and stimulate productivity in the economy the monetary sector and currency reforms implemented under tsp included the separation of fca accounts and rtgs accounts liberalisation of the exchange rate the establishment of an inter bank foreign currency market and conversion of local us dollar accounts into rtgs dollar accounts this process was gradual in order not to induce unnecessary shocks on the economy the entire process culminated in the reintroduction of the zimbabwe dollar zwl through si33 2019 which has since been applied and interpreted by the supreme court in its recent judgment there has been an outcry against the judgment with some stating that it will deter investors from coming to zimbabwe because it undermines property rights nothing can be further from the truth as the supreme court did nothing but to interpret and apply the position of the law since the promulgation of si 33 2019 in essence nothing has changed the supreme court judgment changes nothing but merely enforces the law in accordance with the intentions of the legislature bearing in mind at all times the mischief that the legislature intended to cure it must be remembered that the state consists of the three arms the executive legislature and judiciary the judiciary s role is not to create or strike down laws but merely to interpret them and apply them in promulgating si33 2019 the intention of the legislature was to strip the us dollar as a medium of exchange to preserve it as a reserve currency the supreme court had the occasion to interpret and apply the provisions of si 33 2019 and bring the intention of the legislature into practicality as stated above it is the duty of the courts to interpret statutes and in so doing the court uses where the language used in a statute is clear and unambiguous the words ought to be given the ordinary grammatical meaning per malaba cj the case for determination was whether the provisions of si 33 2019 applied to judgment debts obtained in united states dollars prior to the promulgation of the statutory instrument the court held that all debts accrued prior to the promulgation of si 33 2019 including judgment debts obtained in united sated dollars are now payable in zwl at the rate of 1 1 the court has not done anything save to interpret and apply the law as was promulgated by the legislature the outcry against the supreme court is thus misplaced there is nothing new that the supreme court judgment does it merely applies the position of the law after the promulgation of the statutory instrument it is important to put the statutory instrument and the subsequent court judgment into the context of tsp the intention of the blueprint was to bring monetary and fiscal reforms which will consolidate the economy and increase productivity the minister of finance from the onset indicated that the continued use of the us dollar was no longer sustainable there were no longer adequate us dollars circulating in the system to sustain meaningful economic activity and that is when the gap arose which led to the creation of the black market there being no adequate supply of the us dollar to finance the economy it meant that the currency that was being held in our bank accounts was now a mythical us dollar the actual united states dollar being absent from the system by the time the statutory instrument was passed no one actually had real us dollars in their account anyway the deed had already been done and it was imperative that the law recognises this and puts it into application this judgment should come as a relief to everyone if the court had held otherwise there would be pandemonium in the economy insurance companies would have to pay claims in us dollars simply because the premiums were paid in us dollars there would be a run in on banks as people demanded us dollars ordinary people who had borrowed would be required to pay back in us dollars yet the truth is no one has us dollars anymore this would cause unnecessary hardship on everyone the economy is de dollarising by the end of tsp market distortions resulting in price disparities depending on whether one is using united states dollar cash ecocash or transfer should be a thing of the past at that stage the economy will have successfully de dollarised jaqueline sande is a lawyer strategist and a business consultant
what a start to the year it s been there was so much that could have gone wrong in the opening weeks of 2020 and yet it s been the completely unexpected that s rocked the markets this week it was the spread of coronavirus that s making investors nervous we re not in full panic mode just yet but there s clearly tensions building and the near 3 declines in china on the final day of trading before the new year holiday is a prime example of that central banks come back to the fore next week with a possible rate cut from the bank of england and first federal reserve meeting of the year the standout events the meeting marks a end to a messy tenure for boe governor mark carney and he could be going out with one final rate cut country uk the brexit bill as received royal ascent which means that in case it wasn t already clear the uk will leave the eu on 31 january and enter into the 11 month transitional period this is subject to eu lawmakers passing the brexit deal on wednesday but there s not expected to be any complications there although it would be very brexit if there was one last twist there may be no big ben bong for brexit if you ve not heard this story i envy you but the trade negotiation phase can now get underway not only is the uk keen to agree a new relationship with the eu in that time it also has admirable ambitions to strike one with the us as well that may be less complex but at the same time it doesn t make for an enjoyable 11 months for uk civil servants thankfully this coming week the topic of conversation will instead focus around the bank of england thursday s meeting has gone from a fond farewell to mark carney although brexiteers may remember him less fondly to an actual live meeting carney leaves the boe in mid march before the next meeting later that month it s become a coin toss for a rate cut which typically means it will be unchanged but odds have fluctuated quite dramatically over the last couple of weeks so that could change as we get closer to the vote us the fed is on hold and while no one expects any changes to the target range policymakers could tweak the ioer and provide some clarity on how they will end their purchases of treasury bills next quarter the january fomc meeting will likely see limited changes as the data since the december meeting has been slightly softer but countered by improved optimism following the us china phase one deal the dollar will stubbornly remain strong on safe haven flows but long term fed policy should provide a backdrop for weakness as the fed seems set for a path to see further balance sheet growth mexico the mexican peso will look to see if it remains one of the best performing currencies in latam the focus for peso traders will fall on preliminary fourth

prices have been quite volatile this week not to mention one area that s been particularly sensitive to the breakout of coronavirus fears about the economic impact of a more severe outbreak appear to

daily chart oanda fxtrade advanced charting platform gold gold prices have been relatively stable over the last couple of weeks since events in the middle east settled down rallies are being sold into

as the populist government of andrés manuel lópez obrador amlo in mexico continues to centralize power in his hands by weakening all institutions that represent checks and balances to the growing encroachment of the executive and by changing laws and regulations that guarded individual and property rights from the government s intrusion the incompetence of the administration to perform the most basic functions of governing has led to a series of failures and disasters with skyrocketing social and economic costs perhaps the most glaring metaphor to illustrate such ineptitude is the case of the presidential plane during his decade and a half presidential campaign amlo had been denouncing what he claimed to be the luxurious spending of previous governments when the administration of felipe calderón 2006 12 traded an old and accident prone b 757 for a new state of the art b 787 8 his accusations mounted it turned out that the new plane was not delivered in time for calderón to fly in it but it benefited his successor enrique peña nieto 2012 18 who used it regularly as most heads of state do with their airplanes amlo s demagoguery on the subject mounted declaring that the presidential plane was of such luxury that not even obama had one an image that appealed to many of his uncouth supporters in amlo s small village mindset he couldn t imagine that the air force one program actually two b 747 8 modified to the needs specified by the pentagon which was approved to replace the reagan era planes currently in service would cost more than us 4 billion compared to us 218 7 million for mexico s tp 01 presidential transport 1 the day of amlo s inauguration as president he sent tp 01 to storage in the us and put it on sale what he apparently didn t know was that the plane had a 15 year lease and was not his or the governments for that matter to sell the plane spent a year in storage in california at a cost of more than us 1 million plus the lease payments that continued to be disbursed by the government infrastructure bank it has just been returned to mexico throughout this process the demagogue promised many times to spend the proceeds that he dreams he will get from the imagined sale on the most varied purposes depending on the inspiration of the moment recently he promised the inhabitants of zacualtipán in the state of hidalgo a town of 35 000 inhabitants that he would bring them water with the revenue from the plane s sale but since there are no clients lining up to buy the aircraft in mexico or elsewhere amlo came up with what he thinks is a marvelous idea he will raffle it off to the general population selling 6 million tickets at 500 pesos each us 25 which would generate assuming all the tickets are sold us 150 million perhaps enough to pay the balance of the lease but not to give the money to the dozens of harebrained projects that the demagogue has concocted and this leaves unanswered what the winner of the airplane would do with it since amlo devised all sorts of restrictions for the buyer as was to be expected the brouhaha following the saga of the ill fated sale of the aircraft distracted public attention from the massive failures of the government in areas that affect the welfare of the people far more of which a brief summary follows the public health system of the country is in complete chaos since amlo canceled a world renowned program of popular health insurance to replace it with a centralized government run one that failed dismally when it started on january 1 part of pandemonium is due to the lack of sufficient drugs in the hospitals and clinics of the system because the government centralized all the purchases in the hands of ignorant bureaucrats with no knowledge of health issues the problem is so serious that parents of children with cancer that were not being treated blocked for several hours this week all entrances to mexico city s international airport in protest the latest figures show that 2019 the first full year of amlo in power was the bloodiest with 34 212 homicides an increase of 17 over the previous year this terrible situation is a direct consequence of amlo s strategy of embraces and not shootings that summarizes his reluctance to deal with the numerous bands of criminals throughout the country and his conviction that the root cause of all criminal activity is the country s prevailing poverty which has fallen sharply in the last two decades a fact that he denies his failure in assuaging the violence that afflicts mexico has not led him to rethink his approach but to reinforce it amlo has virtually completed a turnaround in the energy policy followed by his predecessor to open the energy sector oil and gas exploration refining and distribution as well as electricity generation and distribution to private investment domestic and foreign he is re centralizing all these activities in the sole hands of the government s badly run monopolies pemex petróleos mexicanos and cfe federal electricity commission amlo has been pouring large amounts of public money into these money losing behemoths as if we were back in the 1970s a time of increasing oil prices and new and rich oil discoveries both monopolies are virtually bankrupt with an unbearable debt in the case of pemex more than us 100 billion and in all likelihood they will lose their investment grade this year putting the country in severe peril the economy is at a standstill with zero growth in 2019 virtually no private investment and new employment with negative growth for the first time in decades although the fiscal balance has been maintained that is not likely to last long because the government blew half of the contingency fund that had been accumulated over many years to confront serious economic crises like the global one that hit the markets in 2008 the other reason that the exchange rate has remained quite steady under the level of 20 pesos per us dollar which amlo claims is a great accomplishment is a tight monetary policy that keeps interest rates high with mexico s prime at 7 25 despite frequent reunions with private sector leaders in which amlo and the segment of his aides that is more or less rational an absolute minority compared to the ultra radicals that want to extend the government s tentacles in every direction and produce grandiose expressions of solidarity and promises of large future investments the confidence of the private sector is shot for good this explains a serious retrenchment of all investment and the dismal prospects for future growth i believe that 2020 will mark the beginning of amlo s unraveling as he confronts even more serious crises of his own making that will affect his government as it continues to prove its complete ineptitude at performing the basic functions of a good government with the handpicked personnel that he has selected to staff most of it favoring personal loyalty over training the prospects of 2020 in mexico are bleak as it is unlikely that there will be any change in the government s course it will demolish mexico s economy institutions and democracy manuel suárez mier is

with time running out on his final term as president vladimir putin evidently wants to end it with a boom putin has been a cautious steward of russia s 1 7 trillion economy partly to shield it against blowback from his more adventurous foreign policy for the last five years he s imposed some of the world s toughest budget austerity combined with high interest rates that s made russia a favorite of carry trade investors but it s left living standards mired at 2012 levels and economic growth stuck below 2 now the president is changing course and channeling an economist whose pro growth ideas are mainstream almost everywhere else john maynard keynes putin just appointed a new cabinet stacked with advocates for more government spending and investment a keynesian recipe and he s told them to hurry up about it in power for 20 years putin gets credit at home for steadying an economy that suffered a decade of chaos and debt default after the soviet union collapsed but lately stability has threatened to turn into stagnation until now the government hasn t rushed to the rescue it s pared borrowing to a minimum in the last five years and has been stashing any spare cash from russia s commodity exports into a massive rainy day fund russia s first priority was to secure its borders to reduce its vulnerabilities said elina ribakova deputy chief economist at the institute of international finance in washington at the time it would ve been wrong to lean on keynesian theories now they re so comfortable on that front that it s time to start thinking about how to boost potential growth feel the change western sanctions and volatile oil prices have been a key reason for putin s fortress russia approach which aimed to make the economy self sufficient but the turn to keynesian stimulus shows that russia isn t walled off from wider currents of economic thinking there s been a similar shift in other countries the u s has widened budget deficits even after a decade long expansion and the u k and germany have begun to shift away from austerity india and turkey are trying to boost growth via fiscal policy at the first meeting of russia s new government prime minister mikhail mishustin said he wants to get the spending spree underway quickly russians should feel the changes in their lives and surroundings in the near future he said mishustin has appointed former kremlin adviser andrey belousov who s lobbied for more government borrowing and spending as his deputy premier evgeny yasin a director at russia s higher school of economics and one of the country s most prominent economists calls belousov a russian keynesian russian political changes at this moment have one goal to boost economic growth billionaire oleg deripaska founder of aluminum producer united co rusal plc told bloomberg television in davos
president donald trump addressed an audience of the global business elite in davos on tuesday to make the case that ordinary americans have been the chief beneficiaries of his administration s america first maxim at the world economic forum in the swiss alps trump argued that a regime of tax cuts regulatory rollbacks and protectionist trade policies have benefited the working class every decision we make on taxes trade regulation energy immigration education and more is focused on improving the lives of everyday americans trump said adding that the well being of the american worker was paramount on cnbc national economic council director larry kudlow echoed the president s assertions inequality is diminishing right now he said i think we re in a better place many mainstream economists hold a different opinion while low unemployment and steadily if slowly rising wages have improved the fortunes of lower income americans these gains pale in comparison to the investment gains realized by the wealthy few the economic backdrop is such that people s finances are improving and the stage is set for further improvement it s debatable what all of that s attributable to said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com in spite of higher incomes significant wealth building among the middle class has not manifested mcbride pointed out more people are working more people are making money the extent to which people have used that backdrop as way to step further towards financial security such as boosting emergency savings retirement savings or paying down debt is still unclear he said the republicans corporate tax cuts also magnified economic inequality said ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics the tax policy center says that two thirds of the gains from the tax cuts in 2018 went to the top 20 percent of the household income distribution with the top one percent getting 21 percent of the immediate gains he said i don t particularly feel that it s been evenly distributed across the entire socioeconomic landscape said scott cole founder and president of cole financial planning and wealth management economists point out that trump s policies also have led to a ballooning of the federal deficit a growth sapping trade war and a recession in manufacturing even as the stock market has notched record highs there s no way that what s happening right now under a republican administration is fiscal conservatism cole said in his davos speech trump revisited another favorite topic negative interest rates they get paid to borrow money something i could get used to very quickly love that he said in reality negative rates would serve to further erode the financial stability of ordinary americans said karen shaw petrou managing partner of consulting firm federal financial analytics we know that they also destroy household savings and long term retirement security she said it s a move that supports stock markets not personal savings and to the extent that financial security is defined by wealth accrual a large number of households have still been left behind mcbride said we ve seen scant evidence that americans en masse have moved the needle regarding some fundamental aspects of financial security he said regardless of what the headline is i would think it s troublesome if you keep hearing about how great this economy is and you re not participating in it cole said

iowa state university we not just fighting to win an election we are fighting to build a movement sanders said jan 25 how was he on his facts politifact is traveling through iowa in the run up to the feb 3 caucuses this week fact checking statements made by the democratic caucus candidates we previously fact checked andrew yang at muscatine community college and we will be covering other candidates in the coming days sanders opportunities to campaign in iowa in the home stretch have been limited related fact checking andrew yang in muscatine iowa related stump speech analyzers for pete buttigieg amy klobuchar bernie sanders elizabeth warren and joe biden the crowd frequently cheered sanders calls to action with some voters rising to their feet and chanting bernie bernie voters yelled out boos when he railed against what he described as the military industrial complex the prison industrial complex and gop efforts to cut taxes for the ultrarich sanders opportunities to campaign in iowa in the home stretch have been limited because he is required to be in washington d c for trump s impeachment trial that s my responsibility and that is what i will do he said however we are going to try to get back in the next 10 days as often as can here we ll briefly tackle the accuracy of several remarks by sanders the u s pharmaceutical industry charges us the highest prices in the world this is accurate the commonwealth fund a new york based health policy group compared many common medications in the united states and several other countries using the american cost as a benchmark of 100 it calculated the cost in canada the united kingdom france germany switzerland and australia germany was the closest match to the american price tag but canada the uk and australia were all about half the cost other studies reached the same general result broadly the united states spends more on drugs because prices for many drugs are higher and patients usually on the advice of a doctor take newer high cost drugs the average american worker is not making a nickel more in real inflation accounted dollars than he or she did 45 years ago this is exaggerated the median worker in 2018 did make more than a worker in 1974 once you adjust for inflation that said the growth was quite small a cumulative increase above inflation of only about 11 over those 45 years in the meantime it s also worth noting that the wage data used for this calculation excludes income from social security medicare medicaid food stamps and refundable tax credits like the earned income tax credit so it s an incomplete picture of income 49 of all new income goes to the top 1 we fact checked that claim in september and rated it mostly true sanders was referring to growth in pre tax pre government benefit income during the economic recovery following the great recession from 2009 to 2017 which was calculated by one of the leading experts in the field of income inequality research however it s not the only way to measure income and other economists pointed to more comprehensive though slightly more dated studies that compare income growth after accounting for what people pay to and receive from the government a large and boisterous crowd in ames iowa listens to bernie sanders speak on jan 25 2020 louis jacobson politifact if you are a woman you should not make 79 cents on the dollar compared to men this is more complicated than it sounds the median earnings for men and women who worked full time year round were 55 291 and 45 097 respectively according to 2018 census bureau data in other words women made 81 6 cents for every 1 a man made however that is not the figure for equal work the gender discrepancy reflects the professions seniority and hours worked by the two sexes whether by choice or by historical patterns discrimination is one factor but not the only one attempts to measure the gap between men and women doing equivalent work have shown a narrower difference though it depends heavily on the specific profession in question related the fight between joe biden and bernie sanders over social security explained today we spend twice as much money per person on health care as do the people of any other country on earth the united states spent more per capita on health care than every other country studied by the organization for economic cooperation and development in 2018 and the u s total was twice as much as most of the countries studied but not all of them the countries that the united states did not exceed by twice as much in 2018 were switzerland norway germany sweden austria and denmark we have more people in jail in the united states than china does this is accurate according to world prison brief a project of the institute for crime and justice policy research and the university of london s birkbeck college the united states had 2 12 million imprisoned people compared to 1 65 million for china which ranked second on a per capita basis the united states also ranked first in the world ahead of el salvador and turkmenistan china ranked 113rd on a per capita basis what the united nations tells us if present trends continue there will be tens of millions of climate refugees there is much uncertainty about this prediction though sanders was more cautious about his projection in ames citing tens of millions rather than an instance last year when factcheck org checked him saying hundreds of millions a 2014 report by the international organization for migration a un agency addresses the issue of how many people who will move as a result of climate change and environmental factors there is great uncertainty about the figures the report states forecasts for the number of environmental migrants by 2050 vary by a factor of 40 specifically between 25 million and 1 billion the report said the figures will ultimately depend on multiple factors including what actions are taken to combat climate change and economic growth due to the uncertainty the report states that the organization does not advance an estimated figure a 2018 report by world bank predicted that climate change could lead to more than 140 million people

jaqueline sande harare bureau since 2008 zimbabwe has been enjoying a multi currency regime introduced in order to restore sanity to the economy after years of hyperinflation it seemed like the only solution the zimbabwe dollar had all but been rejected zimbabwe dollar notes released in the morning would be worthless by evening the multi currency regime brought with it certainty and the ability to plan into the future something which had become impossible under the zimbabwe dollar era this was a good aspect for both industry and consumers on the flip side though the strongest currency being the united states dollars soon emerged as the currency of choice in the country even though under the multi currency regime all regional currencies were to be accepted as a means of payment the united states dollar soon gained monopoly with currencies such as the south african rand and the botswana pula initially being sidelined and later on being totally rejected in favour of the united states dollar thus the economy was dollarised there is no legislation which specifically introduced the united states dollar as the sole currency for transacting in zimbabwe but the economy simply opted for the greenback in favour of other regional currencies the united states dollar whilst bringing about stability also brought with it many challenges use of the multi currency regime meant that the country could not make use of monetary instruments in order to influence economic activity as such the economy was being run using only the fiscal function the use of the multi currency regime also made locally produced products more expensive as compared to imported products and thus made local products more expensive this had a negative impact on the country s capacity to export and earn foreign currency the transitional stabilisation programme tsp introduced a raft of measures meant to restore macro economic stability and stimulate increased productivity in the economy the monetary sector and the currency reforms implemented under tsp included the separation of fca accounts and rtgs accounts liberalisation of the exchange rate the establishment of an inter bank foreign currency market and conversion of local united states dollars accounts into rtgs dollar accounts this process was gradual in order not to induce unnecessary shocks on the economy the entire process culminated in the re introduction of the zimbabwe dollar zwl through si33 2019 which has since been applied and interpreted by the supreme court in its recent judgment there has been an outcry against the judgment with some stating that it will deter investors from coming to zimbabwe because it undermines property rights nothing can be further from the truth as the supreme court did nothing but to interpret and apply the position of the law since the promulgation of si 33 2019 in essence nothing has changed the supreme court judgment changes nothing but merely enforces the law in accordance with the intentions of the legislature bearing in mind at all times the mischief that the legislature intended to cure it must be remembered that the state consists of the three arms the executive legislature and judiciary the judiciary s role is not to create or strike down laws but merely to interpret them and apply them in promulgating si33 2019 the intention of the legislature was to strip the united states dollar as a medium of exchange so as to preserve it as a reserve currency the supreme court had the occasion to interpret and apply the provisions of si 33 2019 and bring the intention of the legislature into practicality as stated above it is the duty of the courts to interpret statutes and in so doing the court uses where the language used in a statute is clear and unambiguous the words ought to be given the ordinary grammatical meaning per malaba cj the case for determination was whether the provisions of si 33 2019 applied to judgment debts obtained in united states dollars prior to the promulgation of the statutory instrument the court held that all debts accrued prior to the promulgation of si 33 2019 including judgment debts obtained in united states dollars are now payable in zwl at the rate of 1 1 the court has not done anything save to interpret and apply the law as was promulgated by the legislature the outcry against the supreme court is thus misplaced there is nothing new that the supreme court judgment does it merely applies the position of the law after the promulgation of the statutory instrument it is important to put the statutory instrument and the subsequent court judgment into the context of the transitional stabilisation programme the intention of the blueprint was to bring monetary and fiscal reforms which will consolidate the economy and increase productivity the minister of finance from the onset indicated that the continued use of the united states dollar was no longer sustainable there was no longer adequate united states dollars circulating in the system to sustain meaningful economic activity and that is when the gap arose which led to the creation of the black market there being no adequate supply of the united states dollar to finance the economy it meant that the currency that was being held in our bank accounts was now a myth united states dollar the actual united states dollar being absent from the system by the time the statutory instrument was passed no one actually had real united states dollars in their account anyway the deed had already been done and it was imperative that the law recognises this and puts it into application this judgment should come as a relief to everyone if the court had held otherwise there would be pandemonium in the economy insurance companies would have to pay claims in united states dollars simply because the premiums were paid in united states dollars there would be a run in on banks as people demanded united states dollars ordinary people who had borrowed would be required to pay back in united states dollars yet the truth is no one has united states dollars anymore this would cause unnecessary hardship on everyone the economy is de dollarising by the end of tsp market distortions resulting in price disparities depending on whether one is using united states dollar cash ecocash or transfer should be a thing of the past at that stage the economy will have successfully de dollarised jaqueline sande is a lawyer strategist and a business consultant
the pound to australian dollar exchange rates began last week relatively subdued with gbpaud trading around 1 88 after the risk sensitive aussie continued to benefit from the previous week s signing of the phase one us china trade deal however rising criticism of the washington beijing deal began to weigh on market appetite for the risk correlated australian dollar with concerns that the two superpowers were once again set on a collision course chad brown a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics commented that s a giant hole in the phase one deal and there s no way to get around it we re no closer today to resolving any of those fundamental frictions than we were before the trade war started tuesday evening s release of january s australian westpac consumer confidence report also weakened the aud gbp exchange rate with westpac s chief economist bill evans citing the australian bushfires as a cause for deteriorating sentiment amongst buyers the australian dollar aud rose against gbp on thursday however after december s australian unemployment rate report fell to a better than expected 5 1 ending 2019 on a positive note gareth aird an economist at cba was balanced in his analysis commenting the unemployment rate is now on a very gentle downward trend despite gdp growth running well below trend unemployment usually rises when the economy is running below trend bottom line we have removed the february rate cut in our forecasts and pushed it back to april some of the aussie s gains were however held back by lingering doubts over the longevity of the newly signed phase one us china trade deal advertisement pound exchange rates steady on positive uk services pmi the pound gbp was plagued by rising odds over a bank of england boe rate cut last week leaving many sterling traders concerned that the uk economy could start off to a bad start in 2020 also with the fast approaching 31st january brexit date uk markets remained on the defensive as increasing evidence of a possible hard brexit this year weakened the pound this followed comments from chancellor sajid javid who said that the british government were looking to diverge with eu regulations a prospect that left many investors concerned that the uk could face a no deal towards the end of this year mr javid went on to reassure uk markets however saying that the nation s manufacturing sector would not suffer under an agreement with the eu he said we look forward with confidence as we strike that new free trade agreement with our european friends as we strike new free trade agreements across the world it will be a very important time for british business and i can see a british economy that continues to go from strength to strength the gbp aud exchange rate remained steady on friday however despite a better than expected uk markit services pmi which rose from 50 to 52 9 duncan brock group director at the chartered institute of procurement and supply commented 2020 has started on a positive note with this sudden change in momentum however that s where the story will end until this uncorked trickle of new orders and activity turns into a flood for

sensitive to the new global health risk the chinese conoravirus we remain relatively calm though neither around the outbreak of sars nor around the outbreak of swine or birdflu did copper prices fall of a cliff hang seng and local chinese markets were hit by the sars outbreak but it proved short lived as the virus was contained within roughly half a year global contagion effects were limited and they should also be so this time around even if the corona virus has been spreading slightly faster than sars accordingly the aud also weathered the storm and even rose after a while post the sars outbreak even if we remain upbeat on aud vs nzd and gbp it may make sense to remove a few chips from the table given the risk of a surprisingly large escalation of the corona virus gbp could be hit again if the boe ends up cutting this week risk reward is now decent on betting on a boe cut again from a no smoke without fire perspective chart showing how aud weathered the storm around sars swine and birdflu outbreaks source nordea pound sterling traders will be awaiting thursday s bank of england interest rate decision which is expected to hold at 0 75 however since rate cut odds have risen over the course of last week any signs that the boe could take a dovish stance on policy would weaken the gbp aud exchange rate brexit will also remain firmly in focus this week with the uk due to leave the european on friday any signs of a post brexit problem over trade with the uk and eu failing to provide any concrete agreement would leave uk markets feeling jittery on the threat of a no

president donald trump s much discussed phase one trade deal with china sets aside some of the economic uncertainty that has generated market volatility and depressed business investment but trade experts say it falls far short of justifying a globally damaging trade war between the world s two largest economies what s more this resolution could mean higher costs for u s companies and consumers while threatened tariffs on finished consumer goods such as clothes and electronics were avoided the deal also reaffirmed the white house s commitment to tariffs as an enforcement mechanism leaving in place sanctions on 370 billion worth of chinese imports for the foreseeable future this gives american buyers of those goods primarily parts for items made in the u s a greater degree of certainty in their input costs albeit not in the direction they wanted trade analysts said this means companies facing higher input costs would probably begin passing those along to consumers in the form of higher prices if they had not done so already as tariffs become semi permanent chinese producers and u s retailers will have even more reason to pass on price increases said peter petri a professor of international finance at the brandeis international business school overall petri called the deal signed wednesday a valuable agreement saying this is a fragile truce but it s an opportunity for confidence building but he also added several caveats it stopped the downward spiral of retaliations but it is less than what its supporters claim he said some of its provisions are vague and some are unachievable other experts were less impressed i m just underwhelmed said michael o moore professor of economics and international affairs at george washington university i think most people will give a sigh of relief that it s not going to get worse but the real issues remain some said the white house gained nothing by blowing up a nearly completed agreement last spring compared to the may 2019 deal is much thinner and does not entail a long list requirements for china to change its domestic laws and regulations said jacob kirkegaard a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics the trump administration made much of the agricultural purchase concessions in the deal but while the consensus was that the u s agricultural sector will likely be a key beneficiary experts were skeptical that china could or would meet the target of importing an additional 200 billion worth of american goods and services including an additional 80 billion in agricultural purchases over two years above pre trade war levels this requires a 40 percent increase this year and another 40 percent increase in 2021 that seems like a stretch goal said david dollar a senior fellow at the brookings institution it s redistributing income from one group of firms to another one in a very complex way it s not obvious it s a benefit for the u s economy he said with no specific dollar targets per agricultural commodity farmers won t know how many soybeans to plant or pigs to raise making them potentially unable to fulfill much larger orders and petri pointed out that the deal s verbiage gives china wiggle room chinese officials say that they will buy u s goods based on market demand but demand won t grow that fast on its own he said to get such spectacular growth china would have to create massive subsidies for u s goods a huge government intervention that we should not be asking for petri said creating government sanctioned demand at that scale could raise the price of those goods and distort the market some said china also risked running afoul of world trade organization regulations against countries playing favorites with their trading partners in short what was a large and steadily growing market for u s commodity producers in china has now become and will remain highly politicized and hence risky for u s farmers kirkegaard said purchase guarantees weren t deemed the only questionable part of the deal provisions meant to hold china accountable for infractions such as forced technology transfers were anemic according to people who analyzed the text on trade secrets to be honest the language that s in the agreement is pretty loose and generic said harry g broadman managing director at berkeley research group who chairs the firm s emerging markets practice on the face of it i don t see at least on that portion of the agreement a lot that s significantly different from previous types of agreements some of the practices and changes agreed to by beijing were changes that were already in the works or had been previously agreed upon petri said some of these provisions will benefit both american and chinese interests and are in keeping with beijing s longer term economic goals china wants foreign investment and may well roll out new reforms in opening insurance and other financial sectors he said china is trying to create more of an environment in which investment innovation are self reinforcing processes said dean a pinkert senior counsel at the law firm of hughes hubbard reed and a former commissioner of the u s international trade commission pinkert suggested beijing s concessions in these areas were what chinese policymakers wanted anyway i think in the long run it s as much in china s interests to address those structural reform issues as much as it s in the u s s interests he said many criticized the dispute resolution provisions for not including a mechanism for third party arbitration and worried that enforcement ultimately would hinge on the threat to reinstate or ratchet up tariffs while china certainly seeks to mitigate the impact its own economy has sustained as a result of two years worth of trade sanctions the administration s choice to lean into tariffs risks inflicting more damage on the american economy as well the people who are paying the tariffs are u s firms and u s consumers broadman said it s not clear to me what the actual economic impact will be as a dispute resolution measure to threaten china with more tariffs

mark after breaking below the neckline of a head and shoulders formation during last thursday s session with limited price signals pointing to a rebound in the common currency the euro has traded at the bottom of its bollinger band for three straight sessions which should augur a move in the opposite direction with trading around this marker usually not lasting longer than four to five days over the last year support is at 1 1015 while resistance stands at 1 1305 followed by 1 1050 60 the key data event of the week is the fed meeting wed say fx strategists at ing following the easing of trade tensions the fed is to reiterate the message of stability in monetary policy for now the largely unchanged message should not lead to either a material move in the dollar or a more meaningful repricing of the us rate path the latter was recently more driven by the china virus related concerns which led to lower rates globally rather than us specific considerations with the fed unlikely to induce a dovish repricing of the us curve and thus softer usd we continue to look for a broader eur usd stability with a modest bearish bias towards eur usd 1 1000 the euro can be expected to be fairly immune to any political risks for the time being but matteo salvini s antipathy towards the eu may nevertheless cause some turbulence the italian government s instability remains a key issue

global growth concerns geopolitical issues continue to drive gold prices published sun 26 jan 2020 2 54 pm last updated sun 26 jan 2020 4 56 pm while 2019 will be remembered as a superb year for gold investors the initial thud in the early trading weeks in 2020 where gold gained a further 100 following the escalation in us iran tensions has investors hopeful that 2020 will be another great year for the price of gold even though 2020 is not expected to carry the same explosive momentum that saw gold prices jump near 20 per cent during its peak in 2019 the door is yet to be fully shut on another positive year for gold in fact the unexpected burst in geopolitical tensions has already led to gold prices advancing above 1 600 for the first time since april 2013 while no one should rule out a potential further escalation in a delicate situation between the united states and iran the absence of further escalations and downbeat rhetoric over the second trading week of 2020 suggests that the situation will not get worse this means for gold price that there should be a consolidation and we have seen a decline all the way back to 1 535 per ounce as of january 14 less than 10 away from where gold was trading on the opening trading day of 2020 other geopolitical issues for gold investors to contend with include ongoing trade issues where the us china trade tension outlook will remain a sensitive point for safe haven assets such as gold following the signing of the long awaited phase one trade deal anticipation is rising that the next round of negotiations will begin soon this can encourage a bias to expect near term declines in gold momentum a hypothetical break below 1 525 raises the probability that gold prices could be in line to fall below 1 500 for the first time since december 24 if there are further improvements in the us china trade relation outlook coupled with a less pessimistic us federal reserve regarding interest rate policy leading to gold falling below psychological support at 1 500 ambitious investors might even begin to consider that gold could decline as low as 1 445 if there is a break below 1 445 weakness towards 1 400 for the first time since july 2019 is a possibility what can help support gold prices and spare blushes from additional losses are the comments from us treasury secretary steven mnuchin that some trade tariffs will remain in place even after phase one of the trade deal is signed meaning that the agreement doesn t significantly change the pessimistic global growth outlook for 2020 the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd has warned in november that world gdp for both 2019 and 2020 will be at the weakest levels seen since the global financial crisis even the continuation of multiple record highs seen in us stock markets do not seal the cracks that appear in the walls of the world economy aside from prolonged us china trade concerns there are other reasons to have a positive outlook on gold the limitations in what ammunition central banks have left in the tank to combat weaker economic conditions can prevent world stock markets from enjoying another stunning year with advances the narrative provided by fed chair jerome powell that us interest rates will not be increased soon is another potential bonus for gold prices considering that this should weaken us dollar s attraction and gold historically enjoys indications of us dollar weakness gold investors can also take into account before the us election countdown begins closer towards the second half of the year the condition of relations between the united states and north korea the latter went as far to make headlines by testing missiles and suggesting a christmas gift depending on the outcome of nuclear negotiations between washington and pyongyang all things considered there are still a number of global issues that remain unresolved as we move further into 2020 and we can expect further turbulence in gold prices as a result 1 500 in gold should continue to act as a psychological pivot level in prices and potential sellers will likely wait for a decline below this level before finding temptation to monitor whether gold can reverse course away from its explosive start to the decade should gold prices enjoy a continued stay below 1 500 the range previously seen since november until the end of december 2019 between 1 500 and 1 445 can resume jameel ahmad is global head of currency strategy and market research at fxtm views expressed by him are his own and do not reflect the newspaper s policy
don t invest unless prepared to lose all the money you invest this is a high risk investment you shouldn t expect to be protected if something goes wrong join our telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage travis kling the founder chief investment officer of ikigai asset management is making a huge bet on bitcoin to rally before the year runs out despite the fact that bitcoin has been in the midst of a stalling action for the past week and a half the financial expert took to twitter yesterday to share a technical build up structure of bitcoin s price showing trends that have been visible since early 2015 5 years of trendlines perfecting coinciding with the most highly anticipated event in btc history fireworks in store pic twitter com rwncv0cwa3 travis kling travis_kling january 23 2020 complicated demand and supply outlooks according to his chart there is a strong probability that the diagonal resistance and diagonal support for bitcoin will be converging in may 2020 support and resistance are two very important aspects of any financial market especially when it comes to cfds and forex trading these levels are essentially defined by market participants and they define supply and demand both of which can shift quickly support occurs when there s an expectation of a downtrend pausing likely due to a concentration in demand resistance on the other hand occurs when an uptrend is expected to pause due to a concentration of supply temporarily as kling explains the diagonal resistance and support will be converging in may the same time that the bitcoin halving is expected to happen it is expected that the selling pressure will also ease due to the halving miners should be dumping about 7 2 million worth of bitcoin into the market as opposed to 14 4 million per day this huge difference is supply is set to drive demand up thus raising the price of the asset significantly as well kling is the latest market analyst to be betting big on the halving to drive bitcoin to even greater heights in 2020 and beyond several market insiders have made similar bets with companies especially those in the mining space even restructuring their processes and operations to position themselves to gain as much as they can when the block rewards are finally cut in half a month before the bitcoin halving expected in may of this year the halving of the block reward awaits the forks of the first cryptocurrency bitcoin cash and bitcoin sv also at the end of 2020 there will be a halving in the zcash network pic twitter com 2djazmfoud stephen otten cryptoforex_2 january 26 2020 the dollar isn t performing well however this isn t the only pro crypto rhetoric that kling has been pushing lately earlier this week he shared data from the united states congressional budget office cbo which showed that the average budget deficit of the united states would never be less than 1 trillion going forward the data itself showed that the average annual deficit is set to it a staggering 12 2 trillion throughout this decade pointing to even more volatility in both the value of the dollar and the strength of the united states economy in contrast the 1 trillion thresholds that were crossed is well over six times the market cap of bitcoin and about 4 times the market cap of the entire cryptocurrency market the average deficit isn t the only economic metric that is causing concern for investors as at last year the total public debt of the u s hit a record of 23 trillion as it was revealed that the american government has essentially been buying economic growth the federal reserve also added 425 billion to the total supply of dollars in circulation as kling explained the data is more than concerning and it points to an increase in the attractiveness of bitcoin especially over fiat
the priority of the ministry is the food security of the country so it sees as important that favorable external conditions do not lead to shortages of grain in the domestic market the ministry said russian grain exports are so far down 18 this season compared with a year ago and export prices for russian wheat are currently at this season s high any investment in green companies has resulted in major losses so there is no logic to what carney is saying unless it is a cover up for the pension crisis that is unfolding governments have ordered pension funds to buy government debts and then they take interest rates down to negative the governments without climate change are ensuring that pensions will be worthless it seems that he is using climate change as the excuse for the pension system failure moreover the response to the crisis has to happen before people really begin to question the whole nonsensical runaway greenhouse gas nonsense as they dig themselves out of snowfalls not seen in a hundred years green is the buzzword of the day and it seems everywhere you turn today there are only two topics that matter climate change and impeaching donald trump everything else has been put on the back burner so to speak the annual convocation of oiligarchs known as davos is underway and all that the dutiful media would report on was the intense focus on climate change president trump for his part came into that room and did what he always does step on the metaphoric duck and draw the ire of the globalist glitterati but nothing trump said landed with any weight because the davos crowd is in the process of getting rid of america s loki anyway the green economy is being touted by everyone now it was one thing when it began with alexandria ocasio cortez and her insipid green new deal when it was just her and the justice democrats pushing this it could be dismissed as a silly tactic to push the democratic party in the u s unacceptably left by a bunch of malcontent bernie bros when greta thunberg is speaking at both the united nations and davos you know this is official policy mike shedlock picked up on this in a recent post going over all the major central bankers doom porn statements about climate change and as good as mike s article is it doesn t get to the heart of the matter because he doesn t ask why and more importantly why now why is this now such a crisis that we have to alter the shape of the world economy to deal with the potential catastrophe of climate change why won t these tone deaf oligarchs finally come clean about the reality of the weather the ipcc is adding the particle forcing data to their 2022 report which will fundamentally change their climate models to incorporate a small part of the real story of the sun s effect on our weather and even that will force through a change in outlook that will make these decades of demonization of carbon dioxide look incredibly silly it can t be because the weather has been so unbearable hot because it hasn t reality is a harsh mistress as there is record snowfalls all across the northern hemisphere bomb cyclones sweeping in to drop feet of snow across the northeastern u s that are literally unheard of it was a cold wet spring which delayed plantings it was an early winter which interrupted harvests the more the data comes in the more t he usda is altering past crop reports to make the damage not look so bad and the corn prices coming out of the u s are something you have to pay attention to by the way it isn t just the u s russia put in a hard export limit on grains for the first half of this year the last time they did this was because of an incredibly weak harvest corn prices in chicago are still dormant well within in recent historical norms but that is likely because the usda is still counting on 1 3 billion bushels of corn being salable that in reality isn t keep an eye peeled there no matter what ptsd greta and the mighty gore have to say about it so again ask yourself the questions why and why now it started with new ecb president christine lagarde who made the first central bank pronouncement about the need for tackling climate change through green initiatives fueling monetary policy carney said that because of the massive losses from c limate change trillions in pension funds would go bankrupt martin armstrong who has also been warning about the colder planet and the grand solar minimum picked up on carney s statement and he comes close to the truth as to why this push for climate hysterics from the central bankers and the davos crowd but i think martin misses the critical point of carney s statement carney like lagarde the fed and kuroda at the bank of japan are all in agreement now and they know there s something out there they can t contend with carney is helping to prep the ground for lagarde to implement the green new deal as a keynesian stimulus within the european union she will have to override germany s opposition to this while pushing for fiscal integration across the european union but that won t be hard germany s economy is about to bring the house of europe down she was put in charge of the ecb to enforce whatever plan they come up with to deal with tens of trillions in over priced european sovereign debt that is beginning to rise in yield this is exactly as yra harris laid it out in my podcast with him in december but i think this goes even further than that last time they could blame it all on the greed of wall st this was then turned into occupy wall st and has given rise to the well intentioned progressive left that is rightfully and righteously angry that wall st was bailed out at the expense of the lower and middle classes just like karl marx described it s all horseshit but so what what does the truth matter when there s another generation to destroy when this thing blows up they can t be the blame for it these are humanity s saviors after all they ll blame wall st again this time andthe next crisis is one in sovereign debt it will be bigger than the central banks they have been prepping the narrative for a couple of years now with mmt modern monetary theory which is essentially print money until you drop it comes in various disguises universal basic income earned income tax credits and the green new deal but unlike the last crisis the money won t go to save the banking system but to save the broke governments and you save governments by inflating away their previous liabilities in this case the pensions and promises made during the last cycle hence the appeal to greenness and the spectre of the climate change bogeyman honestly it s pathetic but unfortunately it s also working with a lot of people so the answers to the questions i posed earlier are simple why now because the crisis is already here and they have to have us prepared for it when it happens that s what the repo crisis is that s why the fed is considering opening up their repo window to hedge funds it s why the trump administration is still complaining about a rising dollar while running a 1 3 trillion deficit and monetizing it through short term treasury auctions it s why there are more hundreds in circulation than singles and it s why we haven t even gotten started yet when mark carney a central banker is showing us maps of florida before and after a 9 foot rise in global sea levels the whole climate change narrative hasn t just jumped the shark it s carved it up and served it for dinner and since they ve already destroyed one generation of savers they have convinced the next one that it is good and virtuous to have less to have lowered expectations to eat bugs and fake meat and all the rest of it because that is the reality of what s coming a colder planet higher food prices as a percentage of a debased income and total surveillance over your entire life to ensure 100 tax compliance the truth is we went broke a helluva lot earlier than when we got woke now the only question is will you buy what they re selling or protect yourself

cambridge we have suddenly arrived at a tricky stage in global economic development emerging markets are losing their dynamism after a remarkable three decade long run during which they caught up rapidly with advanced economies moreover rekindling this vigor requires a new economic strategy but where will such a model come from and who will provide the intellectual leadership the latest economic forecasts from the international monetary fund and the world bank are sobering pointing to protracted slowdowns across the board in china india sub saharan africa and latin america of course alarmism about the end of growth might be as overblown as past hype about emerging markets unstoppable rise but policymakers in developing countries are genuinely concerned and are grappling with how to revive flagging dynamism in the past governments had a ready intellectual solution the so called washington consensus a term coined by john williamson of the peterson institute for international economics which advocated a broad strategy of macroeconomic stabilisation privatisation deregulation and globalisation some questioned whether and to what extent the strategy worked but the fact is there was a template created by leading western academic and policy institutions that was seen as useful by developing country policymakers and the high noon of the washington consensus coincided with developing countries strong performance two of the current strands of thought that might replace the washington consensus also originated in the west the first represents a reaction against the neoliberal approach and is motivated by several disturbing long run trends weak growth rising inequality an increasingly beleaguered middle class and collapsing social mobility this emerging post neoliberal consensus questions the primacy accorded to markets it advocates a larger role for the state both to generate better market outcomes for example via minimum wage increases and stricter enforcement of antitrust policies and to correct inequitable outcomes via aggressive redistributive policies this approach also calls for more proactive fiscal and monetary policy in the short run the second strand of thought is associated with abhijit banerjeeand esther duflo both winners of the 2019 nobel prize in economics banerjee and duflo argue that economic growth is not really influenced by policy changes or at least not in ways for which we have strong evidence they therefore advocate a strategy of going small focusing on measures such as distributing free malaria bed nets and deworming children that clearly seem to be effective and will produce localised benefits but it is not obvious that either approach is of much help to developing countries the post neoliberal consensus almost entirely reflects concerns in advanced economies secular stagnation and unconventional monetary policies are not high priority problems for governments in poorer countries moreover emerging markets are still growing not stagnating and even inequality which is a common concern takes a very different form and requires very different solutions in developing economies perhaps the biggest drawback of the post neoliberal approach is the dichotomy that it poses or perhaps presupposes between states and markets the reality in developing countries is that both states and markets are weak the very definition of underdevelopment so a policy agenda that focuses on increasing the role of the state may well be unrealistic in addition climate change is a new and critical aspect of the post neoliberal consensus that is likely to prove increasingly problematic on one hand the overwhelming scientific evidence of global warming is a clarion call to action on the other hand policies aimed at promoting rapid decarbonisation raise deep concerns in developing countries because such measures could easily clash with the needs of their energy deprived citizens similarly many developing country policymakers simply cannot afford the luxury of a narrow agenda making them unlikely to take seriously any advice to focus on the small and certain they have no choice but to strive to achieve rapid growth which has been a prerequisite for all successful development transitions moreover the experience of the 1980s and 1990s shows that this objective is not a chimera and that growth can indeed be increased by appropriate policy reforms mahatma gandhi famously said i do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed i want the culture of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible but i refuse to be blown off my feet by any do developing countries today have the capacity not to be blown off course do policymakers have the intellectual and cognitive wherewithal to absorb and assess the new thinking on economic development adopting what is appropriate to their situation and rejecting what is not and do they have their own new ways of thinking about the development challenge consider the situation in the two largest developing countries china and india china has the intellectual capacity but is facing the breakdown of its economic model chinese policymakers now need to find another approach that both encourages growth and ensures that the communist party of china remains in control all the while preventing the extraordinary build up of debt from triggering a crisis it is not obvious to anyone how they can do this meanwhile india s current inward economic turn appears to reflect a broader inclination to be walled in and prevent foreign winds from blowing freely and this intellectual nativism seems to be more about harnessing technical expertise for political objectives than about valuing it for its own sake what is

bengaluru a significant global upturn will remain elusive this year as many economies still face an array of daunting risks despite improved sentiment from an initial us china trade deal and ebullience in financial markets reuters polls showed the global economy in 2019 may have been near its weakest since the financial crisis thanks to trade protectionism and political uncertainty but world stocks had a blowout year with several indexes repeatedly setting record highs with easy policy from central banks set to continue that split between markets and events on the ground may extend into this year according to surveys of over 500 economists covering 46 major economies conducted jan 10 22 when asked what is more likely for developed and emerging market economies this year more than three quarters of nearly 400 economists said about the same as last year in terms of growth rates the world s growth trends are sustainable but fragile we do not see high recession risks in major economies nor do we expect a sharp rise in inflation but we are respectful of late cycle dynamics and various serious political and long term risks said james sweeney chief economist at credit suisse global manufacturing and trade have been in a slump since late 2018 but cyclical indicators are likely to improve in 2020 the rebound is unlikely to be vigorous while very few economists predicted a deeper downturn this year not many more forecast a significant pick up either despite the euphoria surrounding the initial washington beijing trade deal that cooled nearly two years of escalating tensions between the world s two biggest economies in the near term it has certainly removed some downside risks and given sentiment a little bit of a lift said jim o sullivan chief us macro strategist at td securities in the end we re not expecting that to cause business confidence to roar back we don t think trade policy uncertainty is going away in the latest reuters polls the 2020 growth outlook for nearly 75 percent of 46 major economies was either cut or left unchanged from the previous poll similarly the outlook for inflation for nearly 85 percent of those economies was trimmed or left unaltered most central banks were expected to maintain their easing bias despite increasing scepticism about their ability to influence growth or inflation forecasts for the next likely move were still leaning toward a cut rather than a move away from crisis era policies we continue to see interest rates at record low levels lower for longer is fast becoming lower forever said jan lambregts head of global economics and markets at rabobank while most major central banks have been successful in avoiding a deeper economic downturn they have collectively failed to stimulate demand in their respective economies which is not expected to change at least until 2021 we expect most of the 2020s to be characterized by slow growth and very low inflation said jennifer mckeown head of global economics at capital economics given the low level of neutral real interest rates central banks in advanced economies will struggle to offer any meaningful policy stimulus the global economy was forecast to expand 3 1 percent this year unchanged from the october median and the weakest since polling began for this period in april 2018 that is only a sliver better than last year the international monetary fund s latest world growth forecast was slowly converging toward the reuters poll consensus lowered to 3 3 percent from 3 4 percent their third straight cut to the 2020 outlook the apparent ceasefire in the battle over tariffs removes a downside risk to growth but tariffs remain high and we suspect that tensions will persist in other forms adding to reasons to expect the global economic recovery to be a gradual one added capital economics mckeown emerging market central banks have eased policy aggressively but a rebound in developing economies has also been elusive with growth rates in some of the biggest ones moving in the opposite direction china economic growth is set to slow to a 30 year low of 5 9 percent this year on more sluggish domestic consumption and global demand for what it exports

latin america has been observed by electoral specialists for a long time it has been an interesting case study from the electoral point of view with many twists between left and right oriented governments these represented significative changes in the foreign policy agenda between multilateral negotiations and articulation and agreements with developing countries this article aims to discuss the changes that may happen in argentina with the election of a new government regarding its relationship with other countries special attention will be given to its regional behavior focusing on brazil argentina s long term partner with whom it has several signed agreements especially now that the partners have governments of different ideological orientations in the october 2019 general elections argentina went to the polls for the main test of mauricio macri s liberal economic program and one of the most polarized presidential races of recent decades in argentina seeking re election macri attained 40 3 percent of the votes and yet was beaten by the 48 2 attained by his main opponent alberto fernandez elected in the first round among other four candidates that did not reach 10 percent of the votes together more than the defeat of a mandate marked by pressure from its creditors and the unpopularity resulting from deteriorated economic indexes fernandez s victory represents with the former president cristina kirchner as his vice president a return of peronist forces ahead of the country and of a left leadership in latin america s current conjecture from the justicialist party the new president has preciously integrated raúl alfonsin s economy ministry 1983 1989 approached peronist liberal wings under the carlos menem government 1989 1999 and advised nestor kirchner s candidacy when he became the chief of cabinet for his entire tenure 2003 2007 in cristina kirchner s government 2007 2015 he maintained the same post but left on her first year of mandate remaining politically distant since then in this sense cristina s recent waiver to run for president even though she led the polls and his choice of her as plate partner in the frente de todos coalition reflected an effort to broaden its compositions among heterogeneous and fragmented political sectors as alberto s own political trajectory in mid 2018 argentina came to terms with the international monetary fund imf on a loan of us 44 billion that became imf s largest volume of money ever granted by the fund in its history which was expanded to us 57 billion a few months later intended only as a stand by agreement to increase liquidity and strengthen confidence amid the country s cambial crisis 83 percent of the loan that macri s administration received around us 44 billion ended up being allocated to repay other debts that undefined restructure attempts of debt with private creditors soon pointed to the same path for imf s terms this resulted in extremely high levels of debt that may express the major challenge that the new government internally inherits and suggests where argentinian foreign policy priorities should be placed however fernandez seems to have other priorities in foreign policy which he has sought to address in the programmatic terms of its political platform and by pronouncements and meetings he has held since its campaign regarding the country s imf bailout requests and the imminent debt restructuring the political program of frente de todos 2019 phrases an irresponsible foreign indebtedness that will place the next government s foreign policy in front of a system of concentrated powers and interests a reactive stance that fernandez confirmed by pointing to the impossibility of applying further adjustments in conversation with imf representatives and later indicating his refusal of receiving the remaining us 11 billion that were in standby from the total agreed by macri with the fund further through a diagnosis that unipolar structures are giving place to a gradual emergence of a multipolar system the program denounces the central role that relations with the united states would have gained in the previous government proposing in addition to lead broader economic relations with china in accordance with the multipolar trend and attract chinese foreign investment in the region a matter addressed by fernandez s balancing post election meetings with the chinese ambassador about a range of new and ongoing chinese built infrastructure projects he also met with the american ambassador in the same month who reinforced american support to overcoming argentinian economic challenges concerning regional issues the platform points to a loss of centrality of the integration project defends the strategic nature of relations with neighbours and the possibility of restore initiatives that were blocked such as unasur in effect fernandez has already affirmed having no intention to leave the lima group which supports juan guaido s leadership and considers the possibility of interventions in venezuela s crisis however his position is probably in accordance with the position of the puebla group that met for the second time with fernandez s reception in buenos aires that opposes any use of force that breaks a peaceful settlement of disputes in the region finally the regional fragmentation among political and economic models along with different interests of regionalism and global insertion expose the most probable tensions in relations with the brazilian government fernandez s requests for the release from prison of the former brazilian president lula da silva 2003 2010 whom he visited in prison led to openly hostile mentions by the incumbent president jair bolsonaro who put under threat brazil s permanence in mercosur if fernandez and kirchner won the elections the case of the former brazilian president that fernandez accused of being an unforgivable arbitrary situation closely resembles cristina kirchner s situation when she had an arrest warrant issued for treason against the homeland because of a 1994 terrorist attack after giving signs she would run for the presidential elections certainly while the context imperatives of these frictions cannot be ruled out fernandez s first visit to lopez obrador in mexico could mean a rearrangement of proximity among leaders of the region s largest economies at first glance it is often pointed out that given an internal scenario of marked concessions the government could use external interactions to offer fewer moderate responses to the electorate or to remind supporters of its orientation however this logic tends to suggest that foreign strategies could be formed unconnected from domestic audiences and commitments or that the international environment could sustain direct connections to the ballot box s will both possibilities are questionable yet among argentinian domestic and structural constrains different conjunctures could prevail and a troubled relationship with brazil is the case in many of them the unfolding of these stances puts the spot on the interdependent relation with argentina s second largest trade partner while brazilian diplomats declared they expected another approach from fernandez once in office argentinian chancellor felipe sola one of the first confirmed names of the new cabinet immediately declared that relations will be developed not only with the presidents who are friends but with countries we have obligations and interests in mercosur outward oriented relations have taken the central stage the agreement with the european union whose negotiations were closed on june 2019 meant a concert of broad trade issues between blocks that represent 25 of the world economy this also implies that the legislators preferences of each party have been mapped out since their approval is required for the agreement s implementation final process in argentina however the new government will have to conclude the course of an agreement that it did not negotiate and obstacles could be posed during the technical revisions or the ratification itself the timetable for these final steps has yet to be defined considering that foreign policy matters tend to follow legislative support for presidential initiatives ribeiro urdinez 2017 delays or renegotiations still could be articulated even though sectored interests within mercosur economies are likely to outline these options malamud 2019 additionally old brazilian pressures to argentina s phytosanitary barriers especially the list of non automatic licenses adds a reduction in mercosur s common external tariff which could be a threat to the import substitution policies set as key pledges during fernandez s campaign lacalle pou s victory in uruguay coordinates brazil paraguay and uruguay for economic openness and the integration of local producers into global value chains even though the expansion of mostly primary competitive sectors may deepen the bloc s trade asymmetries with its partners with venezuela s indefinite suspension argentina s sole resistance to this agenda will still be defined the restructuring of argentina s debt with private creditors and concomitantly with the imf will ultimately be the closest challenge of the new president in addition to legal strings attached to the national debt the attempt to extend the terms of maturities was defined since the previous period as the only alternative the debt repayments suspensions however should be conditioned to fiscal adjustments that are unlikely to be agreed without the support of the united states the fund s largest shareholder us eventual incentives to approach fernandez may be american companies investments in the country and long term intentions to reduce china s economic influence in the region however the trade war between china and the united states may cool down this dynamic rather than reconfiguring trade flows as argentina occupying us s place of soybeans exports for china it could overflow to the escalation of protectionist effects between them by the beginning of the decade the interaction of emerging and traditional powers on reforming the international financial system of global governance as the expansion of china s foreign investments suggested that bilateral solutions and regional money funds were starting to become a reasonable forecast for financing and prevention of global southern crises chin 2010 in fact argentinian relations with china is underpinned by a range of investment packages for infrastructure projects including nuclear power plants two major dams and a us 2 5 billion upgrade of a rail network that were also carried on by macri s government despite his strategy in the international finance architecture at the regional level on the other hand fernandez s announcements of us 1 6 billion in loans from fonplata plata basin financial development fund a multilateral financial organization formed by argentina bolivia brazil paraguay and uruguay to fund future development plans in argentina and the us 4 billion pledge from the development bank of latin america caf to finance infrastructure ongoing projects in the country may reactivate important sectors of the economy but it still remains to be seen whether regional development banks or arrangements could play bigger roles as argentina seeks alternatives for the financial crisis thus the relations of argentina with the centers of international financial and political power as in previous periods will largely govern the maneuvers of the country s foreign policy for the beginning of the next decade common foreign policy issues of south american countries will be prominent themes in the coming years their relationship with the united states and china as well as the future of mercosur depend on the relationship between the two major powers changes of government would likely have a major impact and since some of them have new governments starting in 2020 scholars should be vigilant regarding the relationships between governments with distinct ideological profiles and preferences

the closest ever no wonder the warning signs of a dozen different armageddons lurking on the horizon are difficult to ignore world renowned virologist and ex pat new zealander prof robert webster says another deadly pandemic is not a matter of if but when could the mystery sars like virus emanating from a live animal and market in wuhan china be the start of that global disaster a score of people

financial activities was needed to pay for the next gfc but its warnings have not been heeded could the next international pecuniary calamity perhaps just around the corner mean our whole monetary

is near extinction events such as a northern hemisphere nuclear war 1 4 annual risk or a global pandemic caused by a synthetic virus escaping a laboratory in such scenarios prof wilson says the resources development and relative isolation of new zealand and australia make them the world s top two candidates for island refuges hideaways where a remnant of humanity could hole up until the dust

executive director for the national emergency management agency says they are all over it sort of the country has extensive and agile arrangements in place across agencies that would allow it to deal with a range of events both foreseen and unforeseen this includes working with other countries to respond to emerging threats in regards to building resilience nationwide a national disaster resilience strategy was launched last year new zealand has reasonable stocks of medical food and other supplies but individuals and families should make sure they have their own supplies the nation s emergency planner says there is no mention of fuel asked whether any members of cabinet had a secret bunker or a panic room stuart black says meeting facilities for ministers are available within the parliamentary precinct in wellington i would note that arrangements are also in place to move parliament to auckland on a temporary basis should wellington become severely impacted by an earthquake it is best to ask customs nz about border closure rehearsals she advises customs nz responds that bits of the border including sea and air ports are closed during regular national security exercises but the country has never tried shutting down the entire border at one time an action that would require cabinet level sanction and so no one knows how quickly it can be done bottom line despite uncertainties new zealand is a better place than most to ride out a global meltdown but once here where to live and how to prepare hoard silver and gold that is the advice of a dunedin man in the education sector who does not want to be identified i don t want to appear like a nutter he says he is not anticipating the collapse of society the world will keep turning but he insists there is a financial adjustment coming that will be big enough to cause our paper money based monetary system to keel over ever since 1971 when us president richard nixon decoupled the us dollar from gold governments have been free to print money without measure the increase in money supply has been parabolic private debt is sky rocketing along with house and stock prices all those bills have to be repaid but when the financial house of cards starts to fall individuals and banks will be caught a long way short he says i can already see cracks appearing silver and gold however hold their value in fact their worth climbs every time the financial markets get spooked and soars when it crashes so he has bought gold silver coins and silver bars he owns five 1kg bars of silver worth 50 000 each when it does go awry he is going to use his hoard to invest in property and companies someone told him you re going to be king of the rats when it all falls down better to be a king than a rat he replied australian born greg cromack wants to move to mosgiel along with his daughter as he says data projections for the future don t look good photo supplied a different apocalyptic vision floats in the mind of greg cromack an australian born new zealand data programmer cromack is alarmed by projections of life in a climate crisis world a widower he describes himself as a scared parent who worries about the future of his daughter i m a deep adaptation prepper cromack explains we re doing too little too late to respond to climate change we re going to have a hard time of it cromack has decided australia will be hit too hard he plans to move permanently to new zealand but not to the north island that will be too chaotic nor to canterbury too dry nor the west coast too many storms ticking all his climate change survivor boxes however is otago specifically mosgiel from his research a population of 3000 to 5000 individuals is ideal when things go pear shaped it will be a big enough community to be sustainably self sufficient in food energy and other basics such as healthcare we re going to have to respond to this on a community level cromack does not believe we will have to wait long to see he is sadly correct people will be able to keep on lying to themselves that life is going great i give us eight years that will be the point when everyone realises that s it cromack is friendly and voluble especially compared with self confessed hardcore doomsday preppers the type that foresee a world gone not just ugly but nasty they keep their heads low one a rambo type individual who lives on the west coast tells a dunedin based intermediary he does not want to talk to a journalist another who lives north of wellington does not want to detail his preparations but is happy to provide tips on how to prepare put earthquakes heatwaves financial collapses or bioweapons to one side however and it becomes clear that the differences between how people believe the world as we know it will end are less important than actually preparing for it a message arrives from the wellington doomsday prepper who is writing his top 10 tips i m sticking to the basics of prepping he writes i m avoiding underground bunkers filled with enough gear to supply a small regional war focus on how you d suggest preparing for whichever armageddon you consider most likely he is requested if you prep for one you prep for the other he replies
each year leftist democrats socialists and radicals are asked to hold their noses and vote for the lesser of two evils this is a false choice because we live in a rigged one party state a plutocracy run by the business party a syndicate with democratic and republican wings syndicate is the proper word for our corrupt one party system because there is no real choice only the appearance of choice we are onlookers cheering for the villain or the babyface in a pro wrestling spectacle we call elections orchestrated by a complicit mass media we must open our eyes to this facade for the first revolutionary act is to call things by their true name rosa luxemburg at both the state and national levels the candidates offered up by the syndicate are corporate funded purveyors of empire whose primary loyalty is to the investor class that funds them in fact the only requirement the syndicate makes on their candidates is that they are capable of raising massive amounts of money from corporations or the corporate rich to ensure they have the blessing of the investor class there are no requirements on morality voting record or policy positions within the business party syndicate mark twain was correct when he wrote it could probably be shown by facts and figures that there is no distinctly native criminal class except congress this corruption is as true today as it was 150 years ago and the higher that one is elevated in the party wings of the syndicate the more fundraising dominates their time and focus it is this process that transforms politicians who might initially believe they can honestly represent the public into marketers whose role is to convince the public that there is no alternative to the capitalist system or the policies written by corporate funded think tanks corruption is not an anomaly but an essential element in the functioning of managed democracy sheldon wolin in addition to fundraising rising in the party power structure requires adherence to the status quo ideology of the washington consensus to obtain backing in the syndicate candidates must first profess a belief in american mythology that the u s is the indispensable country a benevolent force where americans are innocent in our hostilities that capitalism is the only method for organizing an economy that free markets and free trade function without government help and benefit all that inequality is a natural state in a meritocracy and that growth is necessary one must also show fealty to the pentagon and arms industry to the financial interests of wall street and to multinational corporate interests martin luther king jr saw it clearly it means ultimately coming to see that the problem of racism the problem of economic exploitation and the problem of war are all tied together these are the triple evils that are interrelated fealty to the syndicate translates to support for endless wars oil subsidies bank bailouts free trade agreements environmental exploitation and coups against any country that fails to embrace neoliberal ideology this fealty also translates to lower wages increased health care costs poorer schools soaring housing costs growing homelessness and massive student debt it doesn t matter which wing of the syndicate the candidate chooses to join they must embrace the core mythology designed to maximize corporate profits and if voting made any difference they d make it illegal emma goldman the continued lesser of two evils voting by the left has facilitated 50 years of neoliberal policies that have created the highest level of wealth inequality that the u s has ever seen and a series of endless wars instigated and perpetuated by both wings of the syndicate einstein stated insanity doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results so why do leftists continue to behave in this manner have we forgotten that he who chooses for the lesser evil all too readily forgets having chosen evil hannah arendt why do we continue to vote for false choice candidates that move us farther and farther into a hegemonic empire of bases occupying the world to answer this question and envision a path forward we must first understand the history and nature of the corruption and then ask what can be done differently we begin by acknowledging that u s representative government was designed by the founding fathers to ensure that the wealthy slave owning elite controlled the state james madison wrote landholders ought to have a share in the government to support these invaluable interests and to balance and check the other they ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority the senate therefore ought to be this body and to answer these purposes they ought to have permanency and stability representative government was never designed to be democratic it was purposely designed to be anti democratic in order to partner with property owners and assist their crimes of asset theft primarily through slavery and land stolen from indigenous nations early on the mythology of white supremacy was intertwined with our other mythologies of capitalism meritocracy and rugged individualism to hide this immoral theft this piracy together these myths act as a social glue that justifies the inequalities apparent throughout society this mythology still blinds most whites to various forms of institutional racism racialized mass incarceration being the most obvious understanding the foundation of capitalism requires a consideration of the hidden abode of race the ontological distinction between superior and inferior humans codified as race that was necessary for slavery colonialism the theft of lands in the americas and genocide michael c dawson racism and impoverishment are the nature of our capitalist system neoliberal mythology developed over the last 50 years is just the latest form of propaganda used to justify a system that uses racist oppression to control and rob us of our labor our assets and our dignity but this early system of government designed to partner with slavery has evolved into a system designed to partner with corporations representative institutions no longer represent voters instead they have been short circuited steadily corrupted by an institutionalized system of bribery that renders them responsive to powerful interest groups whose constituencies are the major corporations and wealthiest americans the courts in turn when they are not increasingly handmaidens of corporate power are consistently deferential to the claims of national security elections have become heavily subsidized non events that typically attract at best merely half of an electorate whose information about foreign and domestic politics is filtered through corporate dominated media citizens are manipulated into a nervous state by the media s reports of rampant crime and terrorist networks by thinly veiled threats of the attorney general and by their own fears about unemployment what is crucially important here is not only the expansion of governmental power but the inevitable discrediting of constitutional limitations and institutional processes that discourages the citizenry and leaves them politically apathetic sheldon wolin democracy incorporated we now live in a system of inverted totalitarianism this is not classical totalitarianism where a strong leader seizes power paraphrasing wolin today our leaders are products of a system a system gradually created that retains old myths it values corporate power over the public good the economy dominates the political and it uses economic instability to generate passivity in a demobilized society the system is designed to seize the assets of the poor and funnel them to the rich and then criminalize the poor to cover up the theft we citizens are complicit in this process by accepting a passive spectator role we are no longer involved in setting policy or choosing potential leaders and a captured intelligentsia offers a false utopian vision while the ruling elite manage democracy we are apolitical subjects not citizens fixed irrevocably in childhood hoping that the leader messiah will bring us to salvation however there are moments when the public recognizes that they have been deceived that the system is broken and corrupt at these times our political leaders offer a salve of technical fixes using the obtuse language of economics to obscure both the reality of the problems and the cause and when all else fails they blame the bureaucrats of government rather than the beneficiaries of government corruption and largess in this system of managed democracy the two major parties are very protective of their monopoly over us politics should any third party begin to gain a significant following that could compete with either party in the polls they will make common cause in attacking and bringing about the dismantlement of the third party steve martinot internal reform of the business party syndicate or either wing of that syndicate is prevented by the structure that governs promotion within each wing a structure that is based upon fundraising from powerful corporations should any leftist candidate manage to bypass the corporate controlled gates via small donation fundraising they are either destroyed via redistricting or from direct personal attacks by corporate funded think tanks and corporate owned mass media examples of the former are anti war rep dennis kucinich while examples of the latter are too numerous to list recent examples of these attacks include those on rep tulsi gabbard for her anti war position rep alexandria ocasio cortez for her green new deal and rep ilhan omar for criticizing israel when you examine the arc of history since wwii there is a consistency between the two wings of the syndicate on both foreign and domestic policy it is clear that our one party criminal system is designed to fund the military industrial complex to support big oil so as to maintain the u s petrodollar as the global currency and to destroy any liberation movements that threaten corporate profits and u s hegemony manifestations of this syndicate include the endless wars for control of oil coups carried out by the cia to eliminate socialist programs embargoes imposed on any countries that do not submit to neoliberal monetary policies and the creation of a surveillance and police state to crush any dissent at home members of both wings of the syndicate have judiciously carried out these actions tens of millions of people have been sacrificed by the syndicate over the past decades in order to maintain u s hegemony and we a docile public are complicit in these acts we need to understand that this ruthless clinging to power at all costs is no different than what is seen in other criminal syndicates there appear to be no moral limits to the syndicate s piracy including accelerating the global climate crisis to maintain power this latter policy of the syndicate is apparent in both wings with obama s all of the above energy policy and trump s climate change denials u s hegemony and corporate profits depend on controlling the global demand for oil and the syndicate cannot allow any policy that is a threat to this power including the green new deal most environmentalists still do not understand this and assume they can work within the system they have been fooled media manipulation has produced an expectation that the democratic wing of the syndicate will adopt environmental policies to avoid this disaster unfortunately it s easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled mark twain manipulation of americans by limiting the dialogue allowed around political problems and by only giving voice to a narrow range of solutions acceptable to the syndicate is a key element in maintaining manufactured democracy this control is accomplished with commercial and social media organized by a handful of corporations that use divide and conquer propaganda techniques honed over the last century to sow fear racism xenophobia and misogyny the planning and propaganda centers for the globalist policies that maintain this control are the decentralized corporate funded think tanks whose mission is to maintain us hegemony protect global capital and defend neoliberal social policies of austerity within this system of propaganda political campaigns work to construct an image least offensive to their wealthy benefactors and to the voters this image is then marketed to us noam chomsky writes it is important to bear in mind that political campaigns are designed by the same people who sell toothpaste and cars voters are bombarded with messages both from the not so independent corporate media and by political campaigns who now tailor their individualized messaging based on your facebook and google profiles in this sea of propaganda the voter is left to choose between coke and pepsi or during the 2016 presidential campaign between caligula and nero and by voting for members of the syndicate we give tacit approval to a corrupt system that robs us of our power our assets our labor and our freedoms what does it mean to choose between candidates that are incapable of addressing the primary existential threats to humanity namely climate change and war what does it mean to choose between candidates who are guaranteed to favor wall street over main street what does it mean to choose between candidates that will continue to pursue policies designed by corporations that remove the last safety nets we have for health education food security housing and retirement by choosing between the syndicate candidates are we collaborating with a system that perpetuates economic and social inequality controlled by an ever growing military and police surveillance state can lesser of two evil voting be justified in such a system does such participation indicate consent in a system of injustice is there a way to break the cycle all attempts to reform the one party system over the past four decades have proved futile due to the structural reasons described above in fact corporate control of the syndicate has strengthened any efforts to work within the corrupted structure and that deviate from the syndicate s washington consensus are crushed attempts thus far to run a non syndicate candidate in a winner take all election system have been futile both due to lesser of two evils voting which causes small party candidates to be ignored or on the rare occasion when an outsider wins because individual representatives within that system have no power what is especially needed now is an effort to build something outside this system something outside of the control of corporate money let s call this something the movement just to give it a name the movement must be broad based and inclusive to face off against the syndicate therefore it must combine all the issues that the left struggle against no one issue can dominate this uniting is possible because all the political struggles have a common enemy namely the syndicate which is too powerful for any subset of organizations to challenge in addition all the various political objectives of the left preventing war and climate change ending oppression and racism promoting democratic participation ending corporate control preventing environmental degradation dismantling capitalism providing affordable health care and education and ending poverty are all intertwined with the power structure of the syndicate and because the syndicate controls the current power structure it will not allow any challenges to its power within that structure the movement must be built outside that system and in such a manner that the syndicate is unable to control or destroy it so what form can the movement take and what role can existing progressive and leftist organizations have with regards to the movement first the left must acknowledge that all political organizations that currently exist will be unsuccessful in achieving their objectives if they require defeating the core objectives of the syndicate for example any organizations attempting to impact policy as regards global climate change will fail because syndicate power relies on maintaining an oil based economy and control of that oil maintains petrodollar hegemony it doesn t matter that this syndicate control will result in the deaths of billions of people because the syndicate s corporate machine structure will eliminate any member whose primary concern is not maintaining syndicate power alternatively any attempts to reduce global poverty and inequality will fail because syndicate profits depend on that exploitation and any attempts to move away from endless war will fail because the syndicate s control and profits depend on the maintaining a growing military industrial complex any targeted efforts at change will never be powerful enough only a combined effort that involves all leftist interests with massive participation can be successful and any organizations who choose to focus on a narrow set of goals rather than topple the syndicate will fail over time and slowly become more concerned with maintaining their operations rather than reaching their goal which would eliminate their reason for existence in fact such behavior can now be seen in many leftist or progressive organizations with many environmental organizations fully captured and beholden to corporate funding so what can organizations do to build the movement first they must be willing to sacrifice their narrow political interests to the larger goals of the movement this should be declared openly and their education programs must address the interconnectedness of all our political problems they must also identify the primary driver of these problems namely the business party syndicate with its democratic and republican wings organizations must focus on community building of democratic structures outside the syndicate s control organizations should spend little time on election related issues except as outreach to educate and draw in others to the movement and should instead focus on building coalitions with other groups organizations must emphasize bottom up democratic operations that build solidarity and interconnections with other organizations the movement will need to develop its own internal super structure that is independent of the old systems of power with safeguards to prevent power consolidation and disruption by the syndicate and the movement must wait till it reaches a critical mass of people capable of challenging the business party syndicate before it wields its political power so what can be done by individuals now while the path to building the movement is unclear a first step is to do anything one can to disempower the syndicate one way is to demonstrate that your loyalty is not to the business party by registering to vote with a non corporate party no party preference fails to do this since this does not demonstrate interest in building an alternative to the syndicate second vote for candidates who are not members of the syndicate and who are not from corporate funded parties third form local groups to discuss the history and structure of the syndicate so we understand what we are up against fourth join leftist organizations and begin a dialogue about the interconnected nature of all our social problems and the need to unite against a common enemy namely the syndicate fifth in building the movement we must focus on the ideology and vision that will unite us and not on candidate or leader personalities sixth building the movement means doing the hard work of community outreach and education and in particular getting outside one s comfort zone this will include defending those who are attacked by the syndicate and providing the needed economic and educational support to those communities who join the movement seventh dialogue is critical so all members of the movement must work to develop critical thinking and listening skills training must include recognition of the various propaganda techniques that the syndicate will attempt to use to divide us we live in capitalism its power seems inescapable so did the divine right of kings any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings ursula le guin therefore start doing the work to build the movement today so we can do away with the corrupt business party syndicate which is now the greatest existential threat humanity has ever experienced don t be fooled into thinking that participation in elections means that we really have a choice or that this is democracy your choices are extremely limited and will not change the system nor will they help avert disaster this can only be done by building the movement and taking back our power from corporations he who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it he who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it martin luther king jr dr james mcfadden is a research physicist at the university of california berkeley for the past dozen years he has studied economics

at the annual meeting of the american economic association aea in early january former us federal reserve chair janet yellen former european central bank president mario draghi and eminent economists warned that western economies risked japanification a future of sluggish growth low inflation and perpetually low interest rates yet surprising as it may seem this malaise also threatens east asia hong kong singapore south korea and taiwan once called the asian tigers now face slow growth and disinflationary pressures last year hong kong s economy contracted by 1 2 while the other three grew only modestly singapore by 0 6 and south korea and taiwan by about 2 each inflation in each of these three countries was about 0 6 east asia s economies suffered from weaker external demand a result of slow growth in major industrialised countries and china as well as domestic structural and supply factors moreover their growth potential is trending downward economically and demographically these east asian countries seem to be tracking japan for starters japan is the world s most rapidly aging society with 28 of its population aged 65 and above up from 14 in 1994 this age cohort s share of the population in hong kong singapore south korea and taiwan now averages about 14 and is forecast to increase rapidly in the coming decades a shrinking workforce will in turn reverse the demographic dividends that previously supported strong regional growth in south korea for example average annual gdp growth between 2020 and 2040 is forecast to be about one percentage point lower than now moreover like japan in recent decades the four east asian economies are experiencing slowing productivity growth their export industries have encountered fierce competition from low cost chinese firms while low service sector productivity hampers overall productivity improvements and because these countries are already at the high tech frontier they may find it harder to develop new technologies in the future how east asia s policymakers respond to these challenges will be crucial many economists believe that the bank of japan s timid response to the collapse of the country s real estate bubble 30 years ago aggravated the economy s woes leading to the lost decades that followed mindful of this precedent the fed and the ecb have aggressively cut interest rates and injected large amounts of liquidity since the 2008 financial crisis as has the boj under prime minister shinzo abe s administration speaking at the aea meeting former fed chair ben bernanke expressed confidence in central banks ability to provide further economic stimulus using new policy tools such as quantitative easing and forward guidance but many economists are skeptical as former us secretary of the treasury lawrence summers has noted leading central banks have failed to meet their inflation targets despite massive monetary expansion and with interest rates already at record lows it will be difficult to resolve the next crisis with further aggressive rate cuts furthermore monetary easing alone cannot tackle major structural economic weaknesses summers for example argues that excessive saving and low investment in industrialised economies could result in secular stagnation mohamed el erian emphasises structural disinflationary forces such as aging rising inequality and a loss of trust in institutions while economists including robert j gordon highlight slower productivity growth given their significant structural problems therefore east asia s economies cannot avoid the japanification solely by loosening monetary policy in fact such measures might even do more harm than good over time although these economies have not experienced an asset bubble collapse like japan continued monetary easing could pose such a risk over the last year the hong kong monetary authority and the bank of korea have cut their policy rates several times to 2 and 1 25 respectively benchmark interest rates in singapore and taiwan also remain low at 1 64 and 1 375 respectively as the experience of japan has shown expansionary monetary policy can keep the economy afloat but with asset price bubbles and many zombie like firms to stave off japanification the four east asian economies should adopt a comprehensive set of policies to overcome their structural weaknesses first governments should spend more on productivity enhancing infrastructure technologies and education in order to boost potential growth such public investment in productive sectors could complement weak private demand and expand supply capacity governments could finance this increased spending by issuing low interest rate bonds but they must avoid an excessive build up of public debt especially the share owed to foreign investors without an international reserve currency too much debt could trigger a default and foreign exchange crisis second east asian governments must address the issues of population aging and a shrinking workforce they need to encourage higher labor force participation among women and seniors boost worker productivity through lifelong education and skills training and allow active migrant inflows expanding access to childcare and providing flexible working arrangements would help to raise fertility rates and governments must tackle inefficiencies in both the financial sector and regulatory policies in order to improve productivity growth finally east asia s governments must focus on increasing economic and social equality and bolstering public trust in institutions despite japan s prolonged economic stagnation its society has remained harmonious and stable providing a solid foundation for managing stable growth in east asia however rising economic inequality amid weak growth is eroding public confidence in political institutions the civil disturbances that have rocked hong kong and south korea over the last year are evidence of this without strong public trust and confidence the next economic calamity whether a japan style slowdown or another financial crisis could prove difficult to overcome the risk of japanification is clear and not only in western europe faced with this threat east asia s aging tigers must take urgent steps to regain their vitality lee jong wha is professor of economics and director of the asiatic research institute at korea

the week ahead is arguably the most important here at the start of 2020 the federal reserve and the bank of england meet the us and the eurozone report initial estimates of q4 19 gdp the eurozone also reports its preliminary estimate of january cpi china returns from the extended lunar new year celebration and reports its official pmi japan will report december retail sales and industrial production these data points will provide insight into the state of the recovery from the october sales tax and typhoon fears of the spread of a new virus from china and the potential economic impact weighed on the risk taking appetites last week it is still the early days but the contagion rate appears to be tracking something close to sars which ended up slashing chinese growth by two percentage points china and hong kong equity markets were hit the hardest 3 the s p 500 s decline of a little more than 1 was only the fourth weekly loss but the largest since the end of q3 19 china reports the newest pmi readings on january 30 the impact of the coronavirus may not be picked up entirely in the data which will not offer a clean read on the economy due to the lunar new year to the extent that the virus impact is detected it will likely hit services harder that manufactured goods in the first instance that said january manufacturing and non manufacturing pmi are expected to have softened a little 50 2 and 53 5 respectively in december the risk is that the economic disruption will offset the stimulus recently provided the magnitude of the commitment to buy us goods was already a stretch according to some estimates and weaker chinese growth could provide another hurdle it has been widely reported that china committed to buying 200 bln more us goods than the 128 bln purchased in 2017 the last year before the tariffs however last year the us exports to china were about 98 bln so compared with 2019 china has committed to buying 230 bln more us goods china will likely import a bit more than 2 trillion of goods and services this year the political agreement appears to secure for the us a little more than 15 of that market with a press conference after every fomc meeting and given powell s perceived communication challenges it is difficult to say that the january 29 meeting is a non event still for all practical purposes it is there is scope for a small technical adjustment the fed pays 1 55 interest on both required and excess reserves it could raise this by five basis points to ensure the fed funds rate remains within the 1 50 1 75 target range many who think the fed s bill buying and repo operations represent an easing of monetary policy as in qe they may argue that the fed is tightening however most will likely conclude that it would be a technical adjustment and not a change in monetary policy proper the forecasts will not be updated until march and the economy has not materially deviated from fed expectations last year some media reports played up the two persistent dissents against the series of rate cuts and argued powell was losing control however this does not seem to be the case and indeed a clear consensus has emerged at the december meeting 14 of the 17 officials thought no rate change would be needed this year near term downside risks have lessened the us china trade deal may not deserve the embellished official descriptions but an escalation in the coming months seems less likely than even a couple of months ago the uk will leave the eu at the end of january for an 11 month standstill arrangement where nothing changes while a new trade deal is negotiated the risk of a disruptive no deal exit at the end of the year remains but it is not yet pressing nevertheless the implied yield of the december 2020 fed funds futures contract is near 1 30 compared with the current average of 1 55 suggest a 25 bp fed cut has been discounted the bank of england is a different story two members of the monetary policy committee have dissented at the past couple of meetings in favor of an immediate rate cut two other members have indicated if the data did not improve they too could support a rate reduction boe governor carney also sounded more dovish in recent comments the january 30 boe meeting will be the last carney chairs andrew baily will take the reins before the next meeting on march 26 the official comments and the disappointing economic data has spurred a shift in market expectations on january 10 the derivatives market implied a little less than a one in four chance of a rate cut on january 30 by january 17 the odds jumped to almost three in four but sentiment swung back last week and the odds narrowed to a little less than 50 50 it is a close call and on balance the resilience of the labor market the recovery in business confidence and the uptick in the pmi may keep the boe on hold a bit longer if this is indeed the case sterling may pop higher though ideas that lower rates can still be delivered later in h1 may limit the upside quarterly gdp numbers often grab the headline but for many investors the report is a culmination of other high frequency data with some variance moreover gdp data is backward looking it is then more a favorite of economists than market participants that said the mixed signals of the us economy make this gdp call particularly tricky and the first estimate is subject to statistically significant revisions often stemming from trade and inventories the ny fed s gdp tracker as of january 17 pointed to a sub par 1 2 annualized pace the atlanta fed s model pointed to a 1 8 pace the bloomberg survey has a median forecast of 2 1 the composition of us growth may have also changed consumption may have slowed from the 3 2 annualized pace in q3 residential investment appears to have risen and trade also may have made a net positive contribution the headline and core deflator are likely to be mostly steady the federal reserve will look through just about any weakness in q4 gdp and will make allowances for the production cuts at boeing in q1 20 the case of a rate cut is based on ideas that record long us expansion is fragile and will have increasing difficulty coping with shocks the lack of pick up in early q2 will leave the fed with the same choice as last year with price pressures subdued another insurance policy can be taken out to boost the chances that the expansion can be extended eurozone q4 gdp seems easier to forecast growth has been relatively steady with quarterly growth averaging about 0 3 for the past four quarters and 0 2 for the previous two the year over year pace has been about 1 2 over the same period it may not be very inspiring but it is steady and growth potential is probably only a little higher at around 1 5 or so market participants appear to be more confident that the ecb is on hold for the duration that it is of the fed the market sees only about a one in five chance of a rate cut by the ecb this year perhaps the most challenging data point for investors to make sense of will be the initial estimate of the eurozone s january consumer inflation prices fall in january last january prices fell by 1 that means that if prices fell by 0 9 this month as economists forecast the year over year rate will tick up indeed the year over year rate is expected to rise to 1 4 it would be the highest since last april this is one reason why claims of japanification of europe are too simplistic european inflation is nearly twice that of japan s however while we anticipate a base effect rise in european cpi the comparisons are not as friendly and the true signal as likely to be reflected in the core rate that may ease to 1 2 after being stuck at 1 3 in november and december lastly we turn to japan the issue at hand is how quickly it can rebound from the controversial sales tax increase and the typhoons the most direct report will be retail sales recall the sequence of events anticipating the tax increase in october consumers brought forward purchases and august retail sales rose by 4 6 and then 7 2 before plummeting 14 2 in october they snapped back 4 5 in november and probably a little more than 1 in december industrial output fell by 4 5 in october and another 1 in november a small rise of around 0 7 is expected in december yet in terms of the yen these macro considerations seem to be of secondary importance the heightened anxiety over the new coronavirus expressed through the sale of risk off assets and the unwinding of carry trades and those speculators knowingly or unknowingly riding this wave is the primary driver now as the dollar s advance was stalling around jpy110 25 the coronavirus is an economic and financial shock the extent of that shock still needs to be assessed but it could provide the spark for an arguably long overdue adjustment in the capital markets investors may be risk averse until there is greater transparency about the contagion rate and health risks it is humbling to appreciate that despite the advances in science and medicine some 80k americans died in 2017 2018 from influenza the highest toll in 40 years the world health organization estimates that the annual flu epidemic kills between 250k 500k people globally each year
bengaluru a significant global upturn will remain elusive this year as many economies still face an array of daunting risks despite improved sentiment from an initial us china trade deal and ebullience in financial markets reuters polls showed the global economy in 2019 may have been near its weakest since the financial crisis thanks to trade protectionism and political uncertainty but world stocks had a blowout year with several indexes repeatedly setting record highs with easy policy from central banks set to continue that split between markets and events on the ground may extend into this year according to surveys of over 500 economists covering 46 major economies conducted jan 10 22 when asked what is more likely for developed and emerging market economies this year more than three quarters of nearly 400 economists said about the same as last year in terms of growth rates the world s growth trends are sustainable but fragile we do not see high recession risks in major economies nor do we expect a sharp rise in inflation but we are respectful of late cycle dynamics and various serious political and long term risks said james sweeney chief economist at credit suisse global manufacturing and trade have been in a slump since late 2018 but cyclical indicators are likely to improve in 2020 the rebound is unlikely to be vigorous while very few economists predicted a deeper downturn this year not many more forecast a significant pick up either despite the euphoria surrounding the initial washington beijing trade deal that cooled nearly two years of escalating tensions between the world s two biggest economies in the near term it has certainly removed some downside risks and given sentiment a little bit of a lift said jim o sullivan chief us macro strategist at td securities in the end we re not expecting that to cause business confidence to roar back we don t think trade policy uncertainty is going away in the latest reuters polls the 2020 growth outlook for nearly 75 percent of 46 major economies was either cut or left unchanged from the previous poll similarly the outlook for inflation for nearly 85 percent of those economies was trimmed or left unaltered most central banks were expected to maintain their easing bias despite increasing scepticism about their ability to influence growth or inflation forecasts for the next likely move were still leaning toward a cut rather than a move away from crisis era policies we continue to see interest rates at record low levels lower for longer is fast becoming lower forever said jan lambregts head of global economics and markets at rabobank while most major central banks have been successful in avoiding a deeper economic downturn they have collectively failed to stimulate demand in their respective economies which is not expected to change at least until 2021 we expect most of the 2020s to be characterized by slow growth and very low inflation said jennifer mckeown head of global economics at capital economics given the low level of neutral real interest rates central banks in advanced economies will struggle to offer any meaningful policy stimulus the global economy was forecast to expand 3 1 percent this year unchanged from the october median and the weakest since polling began for this period in april 2018 that is only a sliver better than last year the international monetary fund s latest world growth forecast was slowly converging toward the reuters poll consensus lowered to 3 3 percent from 3 4 percent their third straight cut to the 2020 outlook the apparent ceasefire in the battle over tariffs removes a downside risk to growth but tariffs remain high and we suspect that tensions will persist in other forms adding to reasons to expect the global economic recovery to be a gradual one added capital economics mckeown emerging market central banks have eased policy aggressively but a rebound in developing economies has also been elusive with growth rates in some of the biggest ones moving in the opposite direction china economic growth is set to slow to a 30 year low of 5 9 percent this year on more sluggish domestic consumption and global demand for what it exports
when us treasury secretary steven mnuchin threatens to impose tariffs on a country s car industry if it taxes american tech giants you are inclined to believe that he means it if people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies he said we will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies a trigger happy white house steeped in trade disputes with various economic competitors needs little excuse for retaliation so the british government s plan to impose a 2 sales tax on the largest digital companies ensnaring the likes of google amazon facebook and apple provides all the excuse president donald trump needs with trump fresh from a bloody fight with the chinese over import tariffs that had escalated to the point of plunging us manufacturing into recession it is understandable that many trade economists believe his appetite is satiated at least for the moment but this may be to underestimate trump on the issue of the tech giants even if an america first view of trade often means clobbering one s own side as much as the opposition us soya growers and livestock farmers suffered steep declines in export sales after they were effectively locked out of china a moratorium last year was only partially observed and trump was forced to pour much of the money earned from import tariffs into treasury coffers for compensation payments in the agricultural sector an import tariff is effectively a tax on goods entering the country and is supposed to give a boost to domestic firms whose goods become relatively cheaper but the tariff is paid by the importer so increases costs for domestic manufacturers that use foreign made parts mnuchin has been trump s loyal lieutenant through all these battles the former goldman sachs partner and yale university graduate knows the art of the deal probably better than his boss it was mnuchin who travelled to beijing in 2017 with trade negotiator robert lighthizer to kick off the battle with china s president xi jinping starting with a 30 tariff on chinese solar panels imported into the us mnuchin is understood to have been the one who reined in lighthizer s demands that beijing open its markets wider to the west and crack down further on state subsidies he could see how much us firms that relied on imports from china were hurting yet it was only this month that the administration agreed to ease off and work on a phase one peace deal and this happened only after some tangible concessions from the other side had been agreed british firms are already paying punitive us tariffs following a spat between the us and brussels over subsidies for aeroplane maker airbus a scattergun approach by the white house in the wake of the airbus ruling saw the scotch whisky industry punished last year with a 25 import tariff on bottles of single malt in threatening to slap tariffs on the uk car industry mnuchin is well aware that it is in a difficult bind with brexit threatening exports and the need for hefty investment in electric and hybrid vehicles the us accounts for around 8bn a year of the uk s automotive exports there is honour in not being bullied by the us but when the french have told mnuchin they are prepared to delay a similar digital tax the argument for the uk to delay begins to strengthen mnuchin has conceded that the us should fall into line with the paris based organisation for economic co operation and development when it puts forward proposals for a global digital tax if the us honours this promise a delay in imposing a uk tax will seem wise if the us backtracks on backing the oecd plan then as the french have also threatened the uk can revive the tax and backdate it one way or another the tax avoidance techniques of the major digital firms need to be tackled if the threat of going it alone will help spur the us into accepting the oecd tax then all the better why does a stint at boots seem to make bosses hot retail recruits you have to go back many years to find anything to admire about boots the high street chemist founded by nottingham industrialist jesse boot so it s surprising that today it is still regarded as a hotbed of management talent last week sainsbury s said chief executive mike coupe whose reputation was tarnished by last year s failed merger with asda would pass the baton to retail and operations director simon roberts in the summer before joining sainsbury s in 2017 roberts spent 15 years at m s then 13 years at boots and roberts is not the only boots person taking the helm of a british supermarket this year boots lifer ken murphy is replacing dave lewis at tesco both men started working in shops as teenagers so are no strangers to the sharp end of retail but why are the cvs of executives schooled in the 170 year old boots chain now part of us conglomerate walgreens boots alliance apparently so attractive on the surface anyway the business s coping tactics as brutal forces reshape the retail industry on both sides of the atlantic look no better than those of established rivals both roberts and murphy who are said to know each other well face big strategic decisions as their discount rivals aldi and lidl continue to grow in stature lewis has stabilised tesco but where does it go from here its uk market share is still drifting downwards and its international business has largely been dismantled coupe s disastrous attempt to combine sainsbury s with asda tested the competition watchdog s appetite for mega mergers so roberts who is already credited with improving the supermarkets performance will need something else up his sleeve if boots has access to a secret retail tonic its health benefits have been well hidden trump s switch into campaign mode offers a lull in the storm the coming year will lack the economic fireworks of 2019 there will be ups and downs provided by the uk eu brexit negotiations but with a us president more concerned about getting himself re elected than fighting a trade war with china the general picture looks much more settled all the economies worst hit by last year s almost monthly tit for tat hikes in import tariffs between beijing and washington have begun to recover britain germany and france all put in a strong performance this month as their manufacturing sectors stabilised and their service sectors broke out of a trot into a canter britain is a feather in every chill wind that blows around the global economy and a degree of calm will help settle the nerves of the bank of england s policymakers who had looked poised to cut rates this week speech after speech by the finest minds in threadneedle street had revealed a degree of worry about the economy not seen since the aftermath of the brexit vote earlier this month the odds on an interest rate cut had shortened to the point where it seemed highly likely a shocking collapse in retail spending in the run up to christmas prompted bank governor mark carney to join the ranks of gloom mongers ready to reduce borrowing costs in the hope of reviving not just the high street but all areas of a flagging economy a first stage agreement between the us and china on trade combined with the cumulative impact of interest rate cuts over the past 12 months by 49 other central banks have served to turn things around and save the bank from taking any action itself donald trump has the capacity to wreck even his own good work yet that seems unlikely as he moves into campaign mode for that reason alone the outlook for uk interest rates remains as it was ultra low for the next year with only small rises possible if there should be in defiance of brexit spectacular growth
the federal reserve is overwhelmingly expected to begin 2020 as it ended 2019 by leaving interest rates right where they are as they prepare to hold their first policy meeting of the year in the coming week central bankers are sending clear signals they think monetary policy is in a sweet spot frayed nerves on both sides of the pacific have begun to ease after president donald trump last month called a truce in his china trade war and trade relations within north america have resolved as well with the signing of a new continental pact meanwhile employers are still hiring workers are still spending unemployment is still low and inflation is still tame in a nutshell us growth appears to be cooling back towards a long term trend of around two percent and the recession scare of late summer 2019 feels far off both the economy and policy are in a good place as fed number two richard clarida said in a speech this month so after cutting rates three times in 2019 fed policymakers have made it clear they will not move again unless things get significantly and unexpectedly worse they ve been taking a victory lap for the last couple of months and i expect them to continue doing that economist joel naroff told afp futures markets have taken that expectation to the bank as of friday they predicted the fed will not resume cutting interest rates until september at the earliest but can the fed really hold its breath until then fed chairman jerome powell signaled in december the central bank is keeping an eye on global developments a veiled reference to china s slowdown and the brexit saga the international monetary fund this month again cut its growth forecasts for the world and for the united states trump as ever remains a wild card he has groomed the fed to be a scapegoat for the economy s performance and shows no sign of letting up since he needs a solid economy to boost his chances of re election in november in an interview this week with cnbc the president blamed the central bank for bungling policy by raising the key borrowing rate in 2017 and 2018 without that i think we would have been close to four percent gdp growth forecasts for 2020 now call for growth of around two percent slower than last year which was slower than 2018 and upon closer inspection there are always worrying signs lurking in the details the american manufacturing slump continues with no end in sight despite trump s promises to revive industry consumer spending softened toward the end of 2019 and so did increases in worker pay while hiring in 2019 was the slowest in eight years we do believe there s one more rate cut and we think it comes by the middle of this year kathy bostjancic chief us financial economist at oxford economics told afp for the fed to achieve a soft landing we think it requires some further policy combination in the form of more rate cuts while trump has for now buried the hatchet with beijing tariffs remain in place on two thirds of the products traded between the economic powers and with an election nine months away he appears to be turning his sights to the eu brandishing the threat of auto tariffs in particular on top of punitive duties on 7 5 billion in products from the european union and more taxes on french goods in two separate trade battles there s still a great deal of uncertainty that s going to weigh on business investment bostjancic said so the risks have been diminished but not eliminated completely naroff however said interest rates are already so low the fed is effectively boxed in the federal funds rate the fed s principal tool for maximizing employment and stabilizing inflation is now set at a range of 1 5 to 1 75 percent any lower and the fed will be left with little room to maneuver in the event of a shock to the economy naroff said i m looking at them doing nothing this year absolutely nothing
economic sanctions against iran are having an effect even as experts who spoke with the epoch times diverge on the nature of the impact and on how big a role sanctions have played in the islamic regime s reluctance to escalate following the assassination of a top general gen qassem soleimani was killed in baghdad on jan 3 by a missile fired from a u s drone a strike that secretary of state mike pompeo called a preemptive move to keep soleimani from executing an imminent attack on american assets in retaliation iranian leaders ordered ballistic missile strikes on jan 8 that hit two iraqi bases housing u s troops inflicting damage and non life threatening injuries with no deaths on the same day on high alert for signs of u s retaliation iran s military shot down a ukrainian passenger plane shortly after it had taken off from tehran s imam khomeini international airport killing all 176 people on board an iranian man holds a picture of a victim of the ukrainian 752 flight crash during a demonstration in front of tehran s amir kabir university on jan 11 2020 str afp via getty images some reports suggest that iran s retaliatory strike which had been communicated to iraqi authorities in advance and resulted in no loss of life was calibrated to avoid military escalation with a powerful adversary what tehran knew was that a direct attack on the american military would likely have turned the current battle of sanctions and proxies into a hot war between the two countries one that iran s leadership doesn t want tho bishop political consultant and media coordinator for the mises institute told the epoch times the degree to which sanctions altered iran s military response to the killing of qasem soleimani is less obvious bishop said sam bazzi a middle east analyst and founder of the hezbollah watch monitoring project said sanctions are a factor tempering iran s response but because the country still has slack in its economy to absorb them u s military deterrence was the key factor preventing escalation the u s sanctions have not reached their maximum extent bazzi told the epoch times last year mark dubowitz the ceo of the foundation for the defense of democracies famously said the sanctions needle now stands at around a 6 we need to get to 11 as such there is much more room to damage the iranian economy while at the same time the incremental deployments of u s troops in the region prevent khamenei from lashing out as a u s counter attack in an all out war is expected to be devastating to an increasingly vulnerable regime these factors have so far restrained tehran from retaliating proportionately in the aftermath of the assassination this undated ministry of defence handout shows the hms duncan a type 45 destroyer deployed to the persian gulf region as iran threatened to disrupt shipping ben sutton ministry of defence via ap steve hanke professor of applied economics at johns hopkins university told the epoch times that iran s reluctance to mount a more forceful response is likely linked to hopes of gaining some relief from sanctions making an enormous difference in a by not reacting in an identifiable visible way it obviously mitigates the probability of getting additional sanctions put on them and maybe getting some relief from the sanctions in some way either via europe or china or russia or some other non u s entity hanke said in a press conference announcing new sanctions on an iranian general because he oversaw the massacre of 148 helpless iranians in the mahshahr region u s special representative for iran brian hook outlined the impact of the trump administration s maximum pressure campaign on the iranian economy the sanctions we have imposed are the toughest ever hook said on jan 17 they are making an enormous difference and the iranian people are rightly blaming their own government for 40 years of corruption mismanagement and kleptocracy hook the trump administration s point man on iran then said tehran was facing some of the worst protests in its history adding that iran s oil exports were down by more than 2 million barrels per day slashing the country s oil revenue by over 80 percent brian hook r u s special representative for iran speaks at a press conference at the state department in washington on april 8 2019 saul loeb afp via getty images this amounts to a loss of around 50 billion annually hook said adding that president rouhani admitted that iran had lost 200 billion from u s sanctions since their re imposition iran is also facing a banking crisis with roughly half of all bank loans in arrears more than one in four young iranians is jobless and inflation is at 40 percent hook said today the question that people are asking is whether the regime has the competence to avoid a banking disaster and hyperinflation the iranian economy this year could contract by as much as 14 percent he said international organizations such as the international monetary fund imf have noted iran s economic duress death spiral the key thing hanke said of iran s economy is that they ve really been in a death spiral iran s economy has entered a steep recession the imf said in its most recent economic outlook for the middle east output in 2019 is expected to shrink by 9 5 percent as u s sanctions have continued to tighten the key thing hanke said of iran s economy is that they ve really been in a death spiral iran recently climbed to the third spot on the cato institute s list of the world s most miserable countries just behind venezuela and argentina my modified misery index is the sum of the unemployment inflation and bank lending rates minus the percentage change in real gdp per capita said hanke who developed the misery measure still while iran s economy appears stuck in a nosedive hanke said data suggests a lower level of inflation than official figures claim stable black market exchange rates between the u s dollar and the iranian rial in conjunction with other high frequency data that he said he monitors daily are consistent with a 20 percent level of inflation he said this would support bazzi s observation that iran s economy retains enough slack to blunt the impact of sanctions hanke also said that the effect of sanctions is weakened as regimes typically find workarounds the history of sanctions is always the same thing hanke said the targeted parties learn how to adapt how to mitigate the effects of the sanctions according to the united states institute of peace iran has used a number of tactics to evade the sanctions including storing oil on its tanker fleet at sea disguising ships and turning off transponders to preventing tracking if there is an art that we have perfected in iran and we can teach it to others for a price it is the art of evading sanctions iran s foreign minister infamously said in december 2018 at the doha forum between may 2 and sept 10 2019 at least a dozen iranian oil tankers delivered crude oil to china syria and turkey the institute noted worse unintended consequences of sanctions are possible hanke said in that they can spark a circling of the wagons effect this is where people rally around a regime they are otherwise fed up with and inclined to topple because sanctions can easily be portrayed as an attack against the people not the regime s leaders he argued that iran s leaders have been effective in foisting that perception of the sanctions on the public hanke said the roots of iran s economic vulnerability rest in its interventionist policies the economy is a state controlled intervened economy the best way to think about it is interventionism it s got a lot of socialism he said it s gotten worse and worse over time since the revolution hanke said it s inconceivable that any major initiatives can take place without the state s fingers all over it and that this sets in motion the death spiral the question is how fast does the spiral go and that determines when they re going to hit rock bottom he said sanctions just accelerate the spiral
things never happen for one reason indeed history moves as a great confluence of things that appear at their surface very different even unrelated though they may happen at the same moment in time take climate change and income inequality there s been a lot of reporting on the chemistry and meteorological science that helps us make the linkages between the burning of fossil fuels and changes in our atmosphere that set the stage for the massive wildfires in places like california and australia but that s just part of the story as it turns out there s a connection between the world s rapidly escalating levels of debt surging wealth inequality climate change and the increasing squeeze put on the earth s people and the planet s natural resources by an oversized financial sector that s devouring everything in sight by trying to monetize it rana foroohar s brilliant book makers and takers the rise of finance and the fall of american business flags the domestic face of the global plague of financialization she explains how nowadays banks increasingly make money not from lending money to create new businesses or help existing ones to grow but rather by generating and speculating on debt and despite the well documented relationship between this proliferation of debt speculation epitomized with the catastrophic mortgage backed security debacle that led to several million americans losing their homes the obama administration s reforms only set the stage for the biggest banks to get bigger via yet more debt speculation less than half of all derivatives those financial weapons of mass destruction that poured gasoline on the crisis are regulated even after the passing of dodd frank financial reform legislation in 2010 writes foroohar we may have gotten past the crisis of 2010 but we have not fixed our financial system if you are of a certain age the bigness of banks and their dominion over our lives appears to be a totally normal circumstance because it is all you have ever known yet if we don t do something very radical and soon it is all you will ever know this is particularly true if you are one of the millions of americans whose future prospects for marriage procreation starting a business moving out of your parent s home or pursuing your artistic ambitions are being held hostage to your student loan indenture which thanks to congress is not even dischargeable with bankruptcy the only consolation for you is that you are not alone as you work your soul killing job to stay current on your college loans keep in mind that there are whole nations of poor people whose futures are also shackled by a mountain of debt from which only death can redeem them around the world dozens of theoretically sovereign nations are hopelessly in debt to a global financial system that is rigged to benefit multinational corporations those corporations strip these places of all of their natural resources like gold diamonds oil bauxite and rare earth elements and once the materials are extracted from the earth they are sent to the cheapest place on the planet to mould them into sellable products wherever has the most lax labor and environmental regulations at the moment then to grow and protect the wealth generated by this process they park their revenues in off shore tax jurisdictions and with their hidden billions they leverage their financial power to protect the vast political and economic system that made this miserable scheme possible to begin with you see their influence in our media the academy philanthropy popular culture and of coruse in our politics like the smog from the planet s burning forests it covers everything and fills our lungs here at home student debt lenders sink their talons in prospective college students with a persuasive pitch about the virtues of self improvement and abroad debt peddlers use the seduction of progress and economic development to sink their claws into these aforementioned kinds of countries making them into satellites for this consolidated system of exploitation of course there are too many tragic cases where a corrupt political leader just sells out their country s natural resource base for a cut knowing that there will be a soft landing for them and their progeny in a trump tower on jan 17 in a speech that got obscured by as the trump turns kristalina georgieva the managing director of the international monetary fund imf warned that a new analysis by the imf identified a very real possibility the growing dominance of the financial sector was setting a stage for a looming massive financial disaster on the scale of the great depression even as the world grapples with the prospect of irreversible climate change our new research shows there is a point at which financial deepening is associated with exacerbated inequality and less inclusive growth georgieva said many factors drive inequality corruption regressive taxes intergenerational wealth but the connection between excessive financial deepening and inequality holds across countries she continued by using the u s as an example the negative impact is especially visible where financial sectors are already very deep here complicated financial instruments influential lobbyists and excessive compensation in the banking industry can lead to a system that serves itself as much as it serves others the well documented wealth inequality is not isolated to the u s but is replicated in the other of the nations in the organization for economic co operation and development oecd an economic alliance of capitalist liberal democracies where finance capital resides in oecd countries income and wealth inequality have reached or are near record highs as georgieva writes in some ways this troubling trend is reminiscent of the early part of the 20th century when the twin forces of technology and integration led to the first gilded age the roaring twenties and ultimately financial disaster georgieva notes one issue which we did not face in the 1920s but which we face urgently today is climate change it is often the poor and most vulnerable populations who bear the brunt of this unfolding existential challenge as a consequence the imf s managing director cited data from the world bank that as many as an additional 100 million people will be living in extreme poverty by 2030 consider that right now we are in the midst of international refugee crisis with over 70 million people who have been forcibly displaced more than double the level 20 years ago eric lecompte is a noted united nations finance expert and executive director of jubilee usa a non governmental organization that presses for debt relief for the world s developing nations to enable them to direct their financial resources to social needs like public health educations and infrastructure in order to stave off the ill effects of climate change like rising sea levels and the loss of farmland in an interview lecompte said that the world has a tangible example of debt relief making a major difference because of some of the debt relief campaigns we have won over the years in the 2000s we relieved a lot of debt that african countries were holding and because of that it led to great economic growth that in 2008 insulated africa from much of the rest of the financial crisis he said in sub saharan africa this meant that 54 million kids went to school who would have never seen the inside of a classroom lecompte makes the case that the connection between debt wealth inequality and accelerating climate change is not abstract all we have to do is look at ecuador that s in the throes of a massive debt crisis he said right now they are auctioning off about a third of their rainforest and china is buying it because ecuador is deeply indebted to china it is essentially transferring in wealth the vital rain forest to ready it for oil exploration he continued this is happening in countries across the world right now according to the imf more than 40 percent of developing countries are either in debt crisis or in serious debt distress if we really want to deal with climate change it means dismantling this global debt machine that only accelerates wealth concentration and serves itself at the expense of planetary well being
by barani krishnan investing com the oil bears and gold bugs are back the question is how long their host the coronavirus lets them stay for weeks wti at above 55 and brent at north of 65 had felt as unreal to some crude traders as the daily record highs on wall street to some of course oil s continued upside from 2019 was more than justified and they may be right supply risks are higher now than a year ago with opec pledging 75 more production cuts this quarter than in q1 2019 also tensions are still bubbling in iran and other production hot spots like iraq and libya then there s the super hyped u s china phase one deal and what that could mean particularly for chinese oil demand which is the highest in the world yet the global health scare brought on by the coronavirus is threatening to turn the whole bullish argument for oil on its head just for perspective consider this within 24 hours china s official death toll from the virus jumped from 26 to 41 killing even a doctor who had been at the frontline of the battle to contain the epidemic there s more about 1 400 people have been infected globally the vast majority in china wuhan the chinese city at the epicenter of the outbreak is in virtual lockdown with medical supplies and hospital beds running out and there is a clampdown on at least 10 neighboring cities hundreds of millions of chinese travelers are stranded amid the country s biggest festivity the lunar new year and the tourism and leisure industries are suffering big with shanghai disneyland all cinemas even some mcdonalds closed outside china 10 countries have reported infections from the virus namely australia france japan nepal singapore south korea taiwan thailand vietnam and the united states the world health organization has stopped short of declaring the crisis an international concern despite calling it an emergency in china and a lot more could have happened between the time i finished writing this and the moment you began reading the logical question to ask therefore is what actual impact could all these have on the global economy and the demand for energy and how long could this crisis linger the answer is no one really knows the best comparison experts have so far to the coronavirus is the sars health epidemic from 2003 another china originated global health scare that also caused major market disruptions an estimated 8 000 people were infected with the so called severe acute respiratory syndrome and nearly 800 died china s economy fell by 5 percentage points some think the coronavirus has created more panic than warranted and will come to pass like other infections strengthening the world economy eventually yet the ease at which the virus has spread and the trail of havoc it has left in china have left markets assuming the worst the fell nearly 1 on friday its most in a day since october indicating that wall street s months long resilience against rival stock markets might be threatened while the potential impact of the virus remains a guess one thing s certain the longer china remains in crisis the greater the challenge for donald trump who stands for re election in november to compel beijing to deliver on the phase one as for oil itself the holy grail of demand is china with beijing consuming more than 9 million barrels per day last year or almost 90 of the equivalent of saudi production in precious metals much of gold s upside in the near term will depend on whether wall street continues to swoon if the safe haven resurgence from late last week becomes a trend then 1 580

shave between 0 5 to 1 percentage point off china s gross domestic product growth this year against a baseline forecast of 5 9 per cent on the energy front the outbreak has already downed demand for 200 000 barrels of refined oil products estimated claudia galimberti of s p global platts in china s hubei province where the disease was first noted the shutdown of transportation has probably

after 18 months of a tit for tat tariff driven trade war china and the united states have emerged with a truce in the form of the first phase of a trade deal and a victory for both sides conversations among business leaders at the world economic forum annual meeting in davos switzerland suggested there may not be a phase two of the deal until after the u s election in november echoing what president donald trump said before phase one was signed yet that agreement signed january 15 offers the prospect of some economic stability a win for trump and a win china s president xi jinping even before a new coronavirus reached crises levels in china xi was facing a slowing economy which was not helped by the trade war a persistent pro democracy movement in hong kong and the embarrassing reelection of taiwan s anti beijing president tsai ing wen on january 11 beijing considers taiwan an island province xi has called reunification inevitable but the republic of china as it is officially known has been separate from the people s republic of china since 1949 taiwan has its own government democratically elected by citizens increasingly wary of china s growing rising authoritarianism for trump the trade truce offers a distraction from a senate impeachment trial he was trumpeting the deal even before it was signed telling a lake charles louisiana rally on october 11 that farmers would need more land and bigger tractors to cope with demand from china the deal commits beijing to increasing its imports of u s manufacturing energy and farm goods by 200 billion this year and next that includes larger purchases of soybeans and other farm goods expected to reach 40 billion a year although some critics wonder if china can meet the targets while xi and trump each needed a win the on the street feeling in beijing is that trump was more eager to reach a deal online commentators pointed to the power imbalance between the signatories xi s top economic aide vice premier liu he signed the trade agreement with trump others suggested the deal embarrassed xi who wanted to distance himself from the agreement before the signing the white house soft pedaled xi s absence an administration official said that the ceremony taking place on u s soil is a victory in and of itself and that a future meeting between the two leaders is still a possibility according to abc news president trump needs the truce for political reasons said edward alden a trade expert with the council on foreign relations the trade war with china has created a lot of uncertainty in the u s financial markets going into the 2020 campaign president trump wants the financial markets to be quiet and happy signing phase one could boost trump s reelection chances because the president can claim that he is a good dealmaker at campaign rallies said alden i actually do think that it s going to help him in the 2020 election it s one of the few examples in his presidency so far where he can show significant concrete results he came to the presidency saying that he is a good dealmaker said alden he hasn t actually made so many deals mostly what he has done is basically rip up the deals the previous president made on sunday trump addressed the american farm bureau federation s convention about the new u s trade agreements we did it trump said in austin texas as he recalled his campaign promises to improve trade with china and separately with canada and mexico a deal also signed last week trump fired the first salvo of the trade war in march 2018 setting tariffs on china with an effort to change what the u s called unfair trade practices such as a growing trade deficit the theft of intellectual property and the forced transfer of american technology to china at the signing ceremony trump said that china would buy agricultural products worth 40 to 50 billion over the next two years as much as double the pre trade war values according to data from the united states department of agriculture usda net agricultural income in the united states hit a record high of 123 4 billion in 2013 by 2018 that net income was expected to fall to 59 5 billion a 12 year low according to usda economic research service s farm sector income forecast and if realized a decline of 6 7 percent from the usda s 2017 projection by 2019 net agricultural income had fallen to 55 5 billion the trump administration allocated 28 billion to help farmers in 2018 and 2019 but the subsidies have not completely offset losses even though payments to farmers have exceeded what detroit s big three automakers received in the 2009 bailout which cost taxpayers 12 billion chad brown of the peterson institute for international economics told voa that having a signed deal is better for both leaders than continuing escalation of the trade war and things getting worse and worse i do think this is better than that alden said that although the u s requested inclusion of structural reforms such as beijing s subsidies to state owned enterprises and support and subsidies to the emerging industries china won by having shifted that issue to the next stage china was successful in two respects the deal provided a truce from the trade ware which is what china very much wanted said alden he added that it was more significant that on the core issues china refused what the u s was demanding many analysts have pointed out that the deal is asymmetric favoring the u s because china shall appears often throughout the agreement brown said many of the commitments that china seems to be willing to take on in this agreement i think arguably are actually good for china so it isn t just one sided cfr s alden said that china reached the agreement for economic reasons the trade war has clearly done some harm to the chinese economy than what it did on the us economy he said for economic reasons china needs the truce huang yiping deputy dean of the national development research institute of peking university said in an interview with voa on january 10 that the significance of the agreement lies in the fact that it provides a truce to the trade war ending economic uncertainty for both countries the trade war has a relatively huge impact on china huang said the biggest impact is the uncertainty of the policy especially when the two sides are always at war as a chinese entrepreneur i don t know what the tariff rate will be in the future and that will affect their investment plans the investments on both sides are declining and i personally think it is related to the trade war the second impact is more direct huang continued yes your increased tariffs not conducive to my exports which will affect the economy the growth rate of our exports in the nominal value last year fell by 10 china s gdp grew by 6 1 per cent last year the slowest rate in 29 years the government said earlier this month according to forecasts in an international monetary fund report the growth rate will slip below 6 0 in 2020 bill bishop writer of the china focused newsletter sinocism said i think president xi is happy with a truce that doesn t require china to give up too much i m not sure he needed the deal as much as trump did i think for both of them better to have even a small bad deal than no deal at all at this point and that s where we ended up
the week ahead is arguably the most important here at the start of 2020 the and the meet the and the report initial estimates of q4 19 gdp the eurozone also reports its preliminary estimate of january china returns from the extended lunar new year celebration and reports its official japan will report december and these data points will provide insight into the state of the recovery from the

appears to be tracking something close to sars which ended up slashing chinese growth by two percentage points and equity markets were hit the hardest 3 the s decline of a little more than 1 was only the fourth weekly loss but the largest since the end of q3 19 china reports the newest pmi readings on january 30 the impact of the coronavirus may not be picked up entirely in the data which will not offer a clean read on the economy due to the lunar new year to the extent that the virus impact is detected it will likely hit services harder that manufactured goods in the first instance that said january manufacturing and pmi are expected to have softened a little 50 2 and 53 5 respectively in december the risk is that the economic disruption will offset the stimulus recently provided the magnitude of the commitment to buy u s goods was already a stretch according to some estimates and weaker chinese growth could provide another hurdle it has been widely reported that china committed to buying 200 bln more u s goods than the 128 bln purchased in 2017 the last year before the tariffs however last year the u s exports to china were about 98 bln so compared with 2019 china has committed to buying 230 bln more u s goods china will likely import a bit more than 2 trillion of goods and services this year the political agreement appears to secure for the u s a little more than 15 of that market with a after every fomc meeting and given powell s perceived communication challenges it is difficult to say that the january 29 meeting is a non event still for all practical purposes it is there is scope for a small technical adjustment the fed pays 1 55 interest on both required and excess reserves it could raise this by five basis points to ensure the fed funds rate remains within the 1 50 1 75 target range many who think the fed s bill buying and repo operations represent an easing of monetary policy as in qe may argue that the fed is tightening however most will likely conclude that it would be a technical adjustment and not a change in monetary policy proper the forecasts will not be updated until march and the economy has not materially deviated from fed expectations last year some media reports played up the two persistent dissents against the series of rate cuts and argued powell was losing control however this does not seem to be the case and indeed a clear consensus has emerged at the december meeting 14 of the 17 officials thought no rate change would be needed this year near term downside risks have lessened the u s china trade deal may not deserve the embellished official descriptions but an escalation in the coming months seems less likely than even a couple of months ago the uk will leave the eu at the end of january for an 11 month standstill arrangement where nothing changes while a new trade deal is negotiated the risk of a disruptive no deal exit at the end of the year remains but it is not yet pressing nevertheless the implied yield of the december 2020 fed funds futures contract is near 1 30 compared with the current average of 1 55 suggesting a 25 bp fed cut has been discounted the bank of england is a different story two members of the monetary policy committee have dissented at the past couple of meetings in favor of an immediate rate cut two other members have indicated if the data did not improve they too could support a rate reduction boe governor carney also sounded more dovish in recent comments the january 30 boe meeting will be the last carney chairs andrew baily will take the reins before the next meeting on march 26 the official comments and the disappointing economic data has spurred a shift in market expectations on january 10 the derivatives market implied a little less than a one in four chance of a rate cut on january 30 by january 17 the odds jumped to almost three in four but sentiment swung back last week and the odds narrowed to a little less than 50 50 it is a close call and on balance the resilience of the the recovery in business confidence and the uptick in the may keep the boe on hold a bit longer if this is indeed the case may pop higher though ideas that lower rates can still be delivered later in h1 may limit the upside quarterly gdp numbers often grab the headline but for many investors the report is a culmination of other high frequency data with some variance moreover gdp data is backward looking it is then more a favorite of economists than market participants that said the mixed signals of the u s economy make this gdp call particularly tricky and the first estimate is subject to statistically significant revisions often stemming from trade and inventories the ny fed s gdp tracker as of january 17 pointed to a sub par 1 2 annualized pace the atlanta fed s model pointed to a 1 8 pace the bloomberg survey has a median forecast of 2 1 the composition of u s growth may have also changed consumption may have slowed from the 3 2 annualized pace in q3 residential investment appears to have risen and trade also may have made a net positive contribution the and deflator are likely to be mostly steady the federal reserve will look through just about any weakness in q4 gdp and will make allowances for the production cuts at boeing co nyse in q1 20 the case of a rate cut is based on ideas that record long u s expansion is fragile and will have increasing difficulty coping with shocks the lack of pick up in early q2 will leave the fed with the same choice as last year with price pressures subdued another insurance policy can be taken out to boost the chances that the expansion can be extended eurozone q4 gdp seems easier to forecast growth has been relatively steady with quarterly growth averaging about 0 3 for the past four quarters and 0 2 for the previous two the year over year pace has been about 1 2 over the same period it may not be very inspiring but it is steady and growth potential is probably only a little higher at around 1 5 or so market participants appear to be more confident that the ecb is on hold for the duration that it is of the fed the market sees only about a one in five chance of a rate cut by the ecb this year perhaps the most challenging data point for investors to make sense of will be the initial estimate of the eurozone s january prices fall in january last january prices fell by 1 that means that if prices fell by 0 9 this month as economists forecast the will tick up indeed the year over year rate is expected to rise to 1 4 it would be the highest since last april this is one reason why claims of japanification of europe are too simplistic european inflation is nearly twice that of japan s however while we anticipate a base effect rise in european cpi the comparisons are not as friendly and the true signal as likely to be reflected in the core rate that may ease to 1 2 after being stuck at 1 3 in november and december lastly we turn to japan the issue at hand is how quickly it can rebound from the controversial sales tax increase and the typhoons the most direct report will be retail sales recall the sequence of events anticipating the tax increase in october consumers brought forward purchases and august retail sales rose by 4 6 and then 7 2 before plummeting 14 2 in october they snapped back 4 5 in november and probably a little more than 1 in december industrial output fell by 4 5 in october and another 1 in november a small rise of around 0 7 is expected in december yet in terms of the these macro considerations seem to be of secondary importance the heightened anxiety over the new coronavirus expressed through the sale of risk off assets and the unwinding of carry trades and those speculators knowingly or unknowingly riding this wave is the primary driver now as the s advance was stalling around jpy110 25 the coronavirus is an economic and financial shock the extent of that shock still needs to be assessed but it could provide the spark for an arguably long overdue adjustment in the capital markets investors may be risk averse until there is greater transparency about the contagion rate and health risks it is humbling to appreciate that despite the advances in science and medicine some 80k americans died in 2017 2018 from influenza the highest toll in 40 years the world health organization estimates that the annual flu epidemic kills between around 250k 500k people globally each year
islamabad pakistan may have weathered the worst of storms but would have to battle against brisk headwinds of political instability policy inconsistency challenging external environment slow economy and rising inflation among other distractions in its path to recovery in 2020 this was the conclusion of a report pakistan outlook 2020 politics economy and security published by islamabad policy institute ipi the report assessed pakistan s performance in various areas in 2019 and projected the likely future direction of events in 2020 besides looking at the potential challenges that could be encountered by the country it brought together essays written by experts and former policymakers on diverse subjects such as strategic environment foreign policy internal security economy and cyber security the foremost challenge for the government in 2020 would be to bring stability to the political system uncertainty on the political landscape could impede governance and economic reforms the report said it further noted that despite the government and the military appearing on the same page managing civil military relations would remain a major challenge this year political analyst farhan bokhari believes that as long as party structures remain weak and led by families where the highest offices have passed on in a hereditary manner political parties will remain inherently weak and unable to mature democratically a key implication of this situation has been the failure to build sustainable internal structures within political parties for discussions on key policy issues the report forecasts that external environment would remain challenging this year with chances of limited conflict being imposed by india it called on the government to pursue a regional approach to safeguard the nascent afghan peace process from disruptions it moreover observed that the defining foreign policy challenge will come from middle east the report said that pakistan would have to cautiously navigate the growing strategic competition between beijing and washington for safeguarding and advancing china pakistan economic corridor former foreign secretary salman bashir s assessment is that instability and uncertainties at the local regional and global level would continue to pose challenges to pakistan s diplomacy in the times ahead he called for closer attention to pervasive sense of paralysis and loss of direction compounded by fragmentation in thought and actions and a visible deterioration in established societal values former defense secretary asif yasin malik pointed out that pakistan faces multidimensional threats ranging from conventional military to nuclear to proxies to fifth generation which are both internal and external and also have complex interlinkages the report said that the implementation of reforms agenda agreed with international monetary fund will this year test decisiveness of pti government and pm khan on the economic front unlike anything in 2019 it is projected that pakistan s gdp growth would remain close to 2 5 because of slowdown specifically in large scale manufacturing and agriculture sectors meanwhile inflation would remain high hovering around 13 increase in power tariffs and higher oil prices could however cause inflation to shoot beyond these estimates furthermore it is anticipated that policy rates would be cut in 2020 because the current rates are unsustainable economist hussain haider said that having repeatedly returned from the brink of economic collapse it is high time pakistan chooses a more sustainable model of economic growth as the country faces a now or never situation needless to say this would require robust policy and implementation frameworks the celebrated economic turnaround has been seen numerous times before and should ideally not be cause for rejoice in 2020 fiscal reforms will determine the country s fortunes pakistan must ensure that meritocracy planning and education are given their due importance if it is to make its place on the world stage he maintained on the security front the report said that terrorism by religiously motivated and ethno nationalist groups would continue to pose a serious threat to internal security the other major challenge for the leas would come from the cyberspace meanwhile it cautioned that inimical forces would continue to exploit external vulnerabilities and internal discord and weaknesses what is referred to as fifth generation warfare to undermine stability

the newest reading on consumer sentiment from the university of michigan s surveys of consumers shows that americans are feeling pretty upbeat these days two new metrics on consumer holiday season spending published this week found that consumer spending held up through the all important holiday season the national retail federation said that retail sales in november and december excluding restaurants gasoline and cars totaled just over 730 billion a year over year increase of 4 1 percent the commerce department said retail sales rose by 0 3 percent in december when cars and gasoline two volatile components were excluded retail sales grew by 0 5 percent for the month these figures were buoyed by steady consumer sentiment which remained roughly flat in december the baseline sentiment index ticked down a tiny bit from 99 3 to 99 1 and the outlook of current conditions rose by 0 3 points although the index of consumer expectations slipped by 0 7 points this still represents a year over year increase of 10 5 all three metrics consumer sentiment current economic conditions and consumer expectations have risen year over year reflecting a recovery from worries about the federal reserve and the government shutdown that started 2019 consumers will continue to sustain the expansion due to their favorable judgements about their current and prospective financial situation surveys of consumers chief economist richard curtin wrote in the accompanying analysis consumer spending is the pillar on which the economic expansion rests said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com there are a few good reasons for this optimism he added we ve got unemployment at a 50 year low growth in household income and growth in real spending power for most households the sharp downturn in growth apparently promised by the weakening of business surveys from the spring through the early fall has not materialized ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics wrote in a client note pantheon revised its 2020 gdp average quarterly growth forecasts upward from 1 5 percent to 2 percent as a result shepherdson added mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics said the meteoric rise in the stock market also contributes a potent wealth effect that can stimulate spending the wealth effect the rising stock market should be adding about half a point of gdp growth in 2019 and are on track to do about the same in 2020 he said that supports consumer confidence that helps in terms of cash stockholders can realize those gains it makes it easier for them to borrow zandi said the increase in borrowing rates also is helped along by a combination of low interest rates and economic optimism a forecast from credit bureau transunion predicted that americans will take on more debt this year including mortgages credit cars car and personal loans some households are in fact relying on debt to meet necessities but that s not the base case the majority of it is optimism with regard to employability income and the ability to repay that debt mcbride said according to a new bankrate survey 84 percent of people expect their finances to either improve or stay the same in 2020 only 1 in 6 americans expect their financial situation to get worse this year that ties back to that willingness to spend and comfort with taking on debt in moderation mcbride said 68 percent of economic output comes from consumer spending as long as that virtuous cycle retains intact we can keep recession at bay some market observers though argued that comparative sales should have been even higher given the economic fundamentals at play it s really an easier year over year comparison said camilla yanushevsky equity analyst at cfra research the partial government shutdown that stretched on for weeks worry about rising interest rate and waning tax cut stimulus all combined to put a damper on consumer activity towards the end of 2018 yanushevsky said nrf data found that holiday spending in 2018 grew at a rate of just over 2 percent i m surprised sales weren t stronger zandi said last december was a disaster i expected christmas sales because of the easy comparison to be closer to 5 percent many suspect trade could be putting a drag on recent results shepherdson flagged tariffs as a risk factor to continued economic growth both the direct effects of the tariffs a tax on consumers and businesses and the accompanying uncertainty will continue to constrain economic growth indefinitely he said yanushevsky pointed out that in spite of this week s china trade deal the majority of tariffs remain in place which constrains the rate of expansion we think that s going to stifle economic growth she said predicting that the impact to consumers will be magnified as more companies pass along their higher costs it s still chipping into people s wallets she said the trade war hurt manufacturing really hurt business investment in 2019 yanushevsky said predicting retail sales growth of 3 percent for this year we think there s going to be a more material spillover in 2020
things never happen for one reason indeed history moves as a great confluence of things that appear at their surface very different even unrelated though they may happen at the same moment in time take climate change and income inequality there s been a lot of reporting on the chemistry and meteorological science that helps us make the linkages between the burning of fossil fuels and changes in our atmosphere that set the stage for the massive wildfires in places like california and australia but that s just part of the story as it turns out there s a connection between the world s rapidly escalating levels of debt surging wealth inequality climate change and the increasing squeeze put on the earth s people and the planet s natural resources by an oversized financial sector that s devouring everything in sight by trying to monetize it rana foroohar s brilliant book makers and takers the rise of finance and the fall of american business flags the domestic face of the global plague of financialization she explains how nowadays banks increasingly make money not from lending money to create new businesses or help existing ones to grow but rather by generating and speculating on debt and despite the well documented relationship between this proliferation of debt speculation epitomized with the catastrophic mortgage backed security debacle that led to several million americans losing their homes the obama administration s reforms only set the stage for the biggest banks to get bigger via yet more debt speculation less than half of all derivatives those financial weapons of mass destruction that poured gasoline on the crisis are regulated even after the passing of dodd frank financial reform legislation in 2010 writes foroohar we may have gotten past the crisis of 2010 but we have not fixed our financial system if you are of a certain age the bigness of banks and their dominion over our lives appears to be a totally normal circumstance because it is all you have ever known yet if we don t do something very radical and soon it is all you will ever know this is particularly true if you are one of the millions of americans whose future prospects for marriage procreation starting a business moving out of your parent s home or pursuing your artistic ambitions are being held hostage to your student loan indenture which thanks to congress is not even dischargeable with bankruptcy the only consolation for you is that you are not alone as you work your soul killing job to stay current on your college loans keep in mind that there are whole nations of poor people whose futures are also shackled by a mountain of debt from which only death can redeem them around the world dozens of theoretically sovereign nations are hopelessly in debt to a global financial system that is rigged to benefit multinational corporations those corporations strip these places of all of their natural resources like gold diamonds oil bauxite and rare earth elements and once the materials are extracted from the earth they are sent to the cheapest place on the planet to mould them into sellable products wherever has the most lax labor and environmental regulations at the moment then to grow and protect the wealth generated by this process they park their revenues in off shore tax jurisdictions and with their hidden billions they leverage their financial power to protect the vast political and economic system that made this miserable scheme possible to begin with you see their influence in our media the academy philanthropy popular culture and of coruse in our politics like the smog from the planet s burning forests it covers everything and fills our lungs here at home student debt lenders sink their talons in prospective college students with a persuasive pitch about the virtues of self improvement and abroad debt peddlers use the seduction of progress and economic development to sink their claws into these aforementioned kinds of countries making them into satellites for this consolidated system of exploitation of course there are too many tragic cases where a corrupt political leader just sells out their country s natural resource base for a cut knowing that there will be a soft landing for them and their progeny in a trump tower on jan 17 in a speech that got obscured by as the trump turns kristalina georgieva the managing director of the international monetary fund imf warned that a new analysis by the imf identified a very real possibility the growing dominance of the financial sector was setting a stage for a looming massive financial disaster on the scale of the great depression even as the world grapples with the prospect of irreversible climate change our new research shows there is a point at which financial deepening is associated with exacerbated inequality and less inclusive growth georgieva said many factors drive inequality corruption regressive taxes intergenerational wealth but the connection between excessive financial deepening and inequality holds across countries she continued by using the u s as an example the negative impact is especially visible where financial sectors are already very deep here complicated financial instruments influential lobbyists and excessive compensation in the banking industry can lead to a system that serves itself as much as it serves others the well documented wealth inequality is not isolated to the u s but is replicated in the other of the nations in the organization for economic co operation and development oecd an economic alliance of capitalist liberal democracies where finance capital resides in oecd countries income and wealth inequality have reached or are near record highs as georgieva writes in some ways this troubling trend is reminiscent of the early part of the 20th century when the twin forces of technology and integration led to the first gilded age the roaring twenties and ultimately financial disaster georgieva notes one issue which we did not face in the 1920s but which we face urgently today is climate change it is often the poor and most vulnerable populations who bear the brunt of this unfolding existential challenge as a consequence the imf s managing director cited data from the world bank that as many as an additional 100 million people will be living in extreme poverty by 2030 consider that right now we are in the midst of international refugee crisis with over 70 million people who have been forcibly displaced more than double the level 20 years ago eric lecompte is a noted united nations finance expert and executive director of jubilee usa a non governmental organization that presses for debt relief for the world s developing nations to enable them to direct their financial resources to social needs like public health educations and infrastructure in order to stave off the ill effects of climate change like rising sea levels and the loss of farmland in an interview lecompte said that the world has a tangible example of debt relief making a major difference because of some of the debt relief campaigns we have won over the years in the 2000s we relieved a lot of debt that african countries were holding and because of that it led to great economic growth that in 2008 insulated africa from much of the rest of the financial crisis he said in sub saharan africa this meant that 54 million kids went to school who would have never seen the inside of a classroom lecompte makes the case that the connection between debt wealth inequality and accelerating climate change is not abstract all we have to do is look at ecuador that s in the throes of a massive debt crisis he said right now they are auctioning off about a third of their rainforest and china is buying it because ecuador is deeply indebted to china it is essentially transferring in wealth the vital rain forest to ready it for oil exploration he continued this is happening in countries across the world right now according to the imf more than 40 percent of developing countries are either in debt crisis or in serious debt distress if we really want to deal with climate change it means dismantling this global debt machine that only accelerates wealth concentration and serves itself at the expense of planetary well being
after 18 months of a tit for tat tariff driven trade war china and the united states have emerged with a truce in the form of the first phase of a trade deal and a victory for both sides conversations among business leaders at the world economic forum annual meeting in davos switzerland suggested there may not be a phase two of the deal until after the u s election in november echoing what president donald trump said before phase one was signed yet that agreement signed january 15 offers the prospect of some economic stability a win for trump and a win china s president xi jinping even before a new coronavirus reached crises levels in china xi was facing a slowing economy which was not helped by the trade war a persistent pro democracy movement in hong kong and the embarrassing reelection of taiwan s anti beijing president tsai ing wen on january 11 beijing considers taiwan an island province xi has called reunification inevitable but the republic of china as it is officially known has been separate from the people s republic of china since 1949 taiwan has its own government democratically elected by citizens increasingly wary of china s growing rising authoritarianism for trump the trade truce offers a distraction from a senate impeachment trial he was trumpeting the deal even before it was signed telling a lake charles louisiana rally on october 11 that farmers would need more land and bigger tractors to cope with demand from china the deal commits beijing to increasing its imports of u s manufacturing energy and farm goods by 200 billion this year and next that includes larger purchases of soybeans and other farm goods expected to reach 40 billion a year although some critics wonder if china can meet the targets while xi and trump each needed a win the on the street feeling in beijing is that trump was more eager to reach a deal online commentators pointed to the power imbalance between the signatories xi s top economic aide vice premier liu he signed the trade agreement with trump others suggested the deal embarrassed xi who wanted to distance himself from the agreement before the signing the white house soft pedaled xi s absence an administration official said that the ceremony taking place on u s soil is a victory in and of itself and that a future meeting between the two leaders is still a possibility according to abc news president trump needs the truce for political reasons said edward alden a trade expert with the council on foreign relations the trade war with china has created a lot of uncertainty in the u s financial markets going into the 2020 campaign president trump wants the financial markets to be quiet and happy signing phase one could boost trump s reelection chances because the president can claim that he is a good dealmaker at campaign rallies said alden i actually do think that it s going to help him in the 2020 election it s one of the few examples in his presidency so far where he can show significant concrete results he came to the presidency saying that he is a good dealmaker said alden he hasn t actually made so many deals mostly what he has done is basically rip up the deals the previous president made on sunday trump addressed the american farm bureau federation s convention about the new u s trade agreements we did it trump said in austin texas as he recalled his campaign promises to improve trade with china and separately with canada and mexico a deal also signed last week trump fired the first salvo of the trade war in march 2018 setting tariffs on china with an effort to change what the u s called unfair trade practices such as a growing trade deficit the theft of intellectual property and the forced transfer of american technology to china at the signing ceremony trump said that china would buy agricultural products worth 40 to 50 billion over the next two years as much as double the pre trade war values according to data from the united states department of agriculture usda net agricultural income in the united states hit a record high of 123 4 billion in 2013 by 2018 that net income was expected to fall to 59 5 billion a 12 year low according to usda economic research service s farm sector income forecast and if realized a decline of 6 7 percent from the usda s 2017 projection by 2019 net agricultural income had fallen to 55 5 billion the trump administration allocated 28 billion to help farmers in 2018 and 2019 but the subsidies have not completely offset losses even though payments to farmers have exceeded what detroit s big three automakers received in the 2009 bailout which cost taxpayers 12 billion chad brown of the peterson institute for international economics told voa that having a signed deal is better for both leaders than continuing escalation of the trade war and things getting worse and worse i do think this is better than that alden said that although the u s requested inclusion of structural reforms such as beijing s subsidies to state owned enterprises and support and subsidies to the emerging industries china won by having shifted that issue to the next stage china was successful in two respects the deal provided a truce from the trade ware which is what china very much wanted said alden he added that it was more significant that on the core issues china refused what the u s was demanding many analysts have pointed out that the deal is asymmetric favoring the u s because china shall appears often throughout the agreement brown said many of the commitments that china seems to be willing to take on in this agreement i think arguably are actually good for china so it isn t just one sided cfr s alden said that china reached the agreement for economic reasons the trade war has clearly done some harm to the chinese economy than what it did on the us economy he said for economic reasons china needs the truce huang yiping deputy dean of the national development research institute of peking university said in an interview with voa on january 10 that the significance of the agreement lies in the fact that it provides a truce to the trade war ending economic uncertainty for both countries the trade war has a relatively huge impact on china huang said the biggest impact is the uncertainty of the policy especially when the two sides are always at war as a chinese entrepreneur i don t know what the tariff rate will be in the future and that will affect their investment plans the investments on both sides are declining and i personally think it is related to the trade war the second impact is more direct huang continued yes your increased tariffs not conducive to my exports which will affect the economy the growth rate of our exports in the nominal value last year fell by 10 china s gdp grew by 6 1 per cent last year the slowest rate in 29 years the government said earlier this month according to forecasts in an international monetary fund report the growth rate will slip below 6 0 in 2020 bill bishop writer of the china focused newsletter sinocism said i think president xi is happy with a truce that doesn t require china to give up too much i m not sure he needed the deal as much as trump did i think for both of them better to have even a small bad deal than no deal at all at this point and that s where we ended up

all is not well with the global economy the us china trade tiff and a slowdown in manufacturing across the west have pulled down demand for base metals especially aluminium at the london metal exchange lme the spot price of aluminium was 1 775 tonne last friday down about five per cent from the levels a year ago the international monetary fund imf in its january world economic outlook report revised lower the global economic growth in 2020 and 2021 by 0 1 per cent and 0 2 per cent from its october estimates to 3 3 per cent and 3 4 per cent respectively in 2019 the global economy is likely to have grown by 2 9 per cent however depending on the development in the us china trade war the global growth may even move lower slower economic expansion would mean less industrial activity resulting in subdued demand for base metals sober demand since the auto industry is the largest consumer of aluminium its slowdown across the globe has been a dampener for the metal with reduced consumer spending uncertainty remains for the sector rating agency moody s has given a negative outlook for the global auto industry in 2020 as it expects light vehicle sales to decline by 0 9 per cent following a projected 3 8 per cent decline in 2019 demand in china the single biggest consumer little over 50 per cent of global consumption as well as the top producer around 56 per cent of global production of the metal can have a significant influence on the price of aluminium this year if it improves many chinese companies are taking an effort to strike deals to build roads ports and other infrastructure requirements in other countries this may boost the demand for the metal going ahead further as emerging markets including india thailand and indonesia aim for more industrialisation it can help aluminium from the demand side sufficient supply the global primary aluminium production in 2019 contracted for the first time in a decade despite the entry of russian major rusal s aluminium in the market as the us lifted sanctions on the company according to the international aluminium institute iai the production was down 1 per cent to 63 7 million tonnes the last time the metal s output contracted was in 2009 when it dropped 5 7 per cent the major reason for the 2019 fall was china which saw its production drop nearly 2 per cent to 35 8 million tonnes western europe and latin america too saw a dip in production in 2019 that said the market continues to have excess supply production in aluminium has been in excess of demand for three years now by 3 4 million tonnes in 2019 while production was 63 69 million tonnes demand was 60 million tonnes thus the outlook from the supply point is not very encouraging for aluminium investors further the issues faced by the chinese smelters seem to be only temporary going forward the supply from these units can be expected to be restored which will only add to the already surplus production also the output from countries in the gulf cooperation council gcc has been steadily increasing currently gcc production stands at 9 per cent of the global output price outlook going ahead in 2020 a strong price rally is doubtful given the weak economic outlook for china as also the us and europe one factor that gives comfort to aluminium investors now is a spike in the cancelled warrants on aluminium at the lme when a warrant is cancelled it means that the holder of the warrant generally large traders is not ready to make their stock available to the market cancelled warrants on aluminium inventories started shooting up in the last week of december 2019 from 162 700 tonnes in end november it ballooned to 623 225 tonnes on january 22 highest since 2016 and stood at 528 075 tonnes as of january 24 cancelled warrants now account for 48 per cent of the total inventory at lme warehouses the highest ever was 56 per cent in 2014 the spike in cancelled warrants is now squeezing the supply available in the market a positive signal for the price for the short term however note that if the prices scale above 2 000 tonne a fresh bout of supply may come into the market from closed smelters keeping a check on the price outlook for indian market in india almost half the demand for aluminium is from the power sector unlike other countries where it is the auto sector that drives the demand in india the auto sector consumes about 15 per cent of the aluminium produced in the country there is not much upside seen in the aluminium price in the domestic market too aluminium scrap imports come into india in bulk quantities so if the global excesses find a way to india this year again with no custom barriers the prices may move in tandem with the global market share copy link email facebook twitter telegram linkedin whatsapp reddit
georgieva predicted that the global economy would grow 3 3 per cent this year and 3 4 per cent next year but cautioned that 3 3 per cent is not a fantastic growth it is sluggish that improvement was partly a result of a recent easing of trade tensions including the agreement this month between the united states and china she said she also cited interest rate cuts by 49 central banks and signs that industrial production around the world was starting to bottom out kristalina georgieva managing director of the international monetary fund said the global economy s prospects had improved noticeably even in the three months since the fund s annual meeting with the world bank top economic policymakers and business leaders from around the world made fairly upbeat predictions for global economic growth this year at the world economic forum but they cautioned that already low interest rates meant there was limited room to respond if new problems arose she warned that with interest rates already very low or even negative in many places it would not be easy to respond if new difficulties emerged in what appeared to be a veiled reference to possible economic consequences from a new virus in china and bushfires in australia georgieva said january had already produced events that posed new risks and that policymakers would need to be able to respond more quickly than in the past when things went wrong treasury secretary steven mnuchin alluded indirectly to the new coronavirus that led beijing to quarantine more than a dozen cities in china this week saying health challenges need to be watched closely problems at boeing which has temporarily halted production of its 737 max jets after two crashes could trim us economic growth by as much as one half to three quarters of a percentage point in the short term he said while adding that the united states still has a very robust economic outlook through 2020 europe and japan have been at the centre of concerns that negative interest rates leave little room for policymakers to ease monetary policy and stimulate growth if needed on friday the top central bankers from both places acknowledged the dangers of negative interest rates even as they said they saw no immediate opportunity to tighten monetary policy christine lagarde president of the european central bank said she welcomed figures showing lower unemployment in europe and wages rising 2 5 per cent a year but she warned that inflation had not yet risen to the point that the central bank could tighten monetary policy which would push up short term interest rates and leave room to cut them later we are seeing inflation moving a teeny tiny bit she said

hope yen and calvin woodward associated press washington abroad at home and in twitter s ether president donald trump unleashed a fusillade of statements over the past week as the senate impeachment trial unfolded and the davos economic forum played out in switzerland on impeachment the state of the country abortion pollution and more trump didn t tell the story straight a week in review missile attack trump on u s troops targeted by the iranian missile attack in iraq this month i heard they had headaches and a couple of other things and i can report it is not very serious no i don t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that i ve seen no i do not consider that to be bad injuries no news conference wednesday in davos switzerland the facts that assurance is misleading at best the pentagon said friday that 34 service members suffered traumatic brain injury in the attack and half were taken to germany or back to the u s for further observation and treatment traumatic brain injury can be severe enough to cause life long debilitation or death the severity of the brain injuries has not been described in detail by the pentagon evaluation of the wounded troops continues in the first few days after the attacks trump inaccurately told the nation that no american service members were hurt abortion trump on gov ralph northam d va the governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth remarks at anti abortion rally friday the facts no northam he didn t trump routinely twists northam s words which were convoluted to begin with noting that late term abortions usually only happen if a fetus is severely deformed and unlikely to survive northam laid out a scenario in which such a fetus is not aborted and the baby is delivered then he said the baby would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between doctors and the mother about what to do in extremely rare instances babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age blue collar boom trump this is a blue collar boom since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by plus 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1 remarks in davos on tuesday more ap fact check trump s compulsive claims of biggest ever more ap fact check trump says pelosi dems defended iran general the facts it isn t a boom for blue collar workers they haven t done much better than everyone else and some of their gains under trump have faded in the past year as his trade war hurt manufacturing the mining and logging industry for example which includes oil and gas workers lost 21 000 jobs last year manufacturers have added just 9 000 jobs in the past six months while the economy as a whole gained more than 1 1 million jobs during that period the u s economy is still heavily oriented toward services while factory jobs have grown other jobs have grown faster so manufacturing has slightly shrunk as a proportion of the work force since trump took office he s right that net worth among the bottom half has risen but from such a low base that no boom can be claimed the federal reserve says the bottom half has just 1 6 of the nation s wealth compared with 1 1 when trump took office it was 2 1 in 2006 trump for the first time in decades we are no longer simply concentrating wealth in the hands of a few we are concentrating and creating the most inclusive economy to ever exist davos remarks the facts that s not true wealth is overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a few the richest 1 of americans own 32 of the nation s wealth about the same as in early 2017 when the president was inaugurated the middle class share defined by the fed as those from the exact middle of the wealth distribution up to the top 10 remains at about 29 this despite the slight gains of the bottom half the percentage of americans who own their own homes a key source of wealth building has improved modestly under trump but remains below the level seen as recently as 2013 ocean debris trump we have to do something about other continents we have to do something about other countries we have a beautiful ocean called the pacific ocean where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that s put there by other countries davos news conference wednesday the facts he s right that garbage from abroad has come to u s shores by sea what he does not say is that garbage from the u s also makes it over the ocean to other countries and that americans have plenty to do with trashing their own shores debris from asia was most noticeable after the 2011 japanese tsunami said marine debris expert kara lavender law of the sea education association but the same can be said about debris entering the ocean from the u s and washing ashore in asia in fact she said most debris is not tracked to the country of origin the united states produces the largest amount of plastic waste in the world by weight law said most debris we find on the coast of the u s is likely from the u s denise hardesty a scientist who researches ocean trash for australia s federal science organization said by email impeachment and ukraine trump on military aid to ukraine remember this they got their money and they got it early interview wednesday with fox business network trump they got their money long before schedule davos news conference the facts they got the money months late congress approved nearly 400 million in aid to ukraine in the early months of 2019 u s officials involved with the aid learned in the summer that trump had ordered the assistance to held back as he pressed ukraine to announce an investigation of democrats it was released sept 11 only after a whistleblower s complaint about trump s pressure on ukraine had surfaced and a few days after democrats in congress opened the investigation previous rounds of assistance were not similarly disrupted trump on democratic rep adam schiff d calif the lead impeachment manager for the senate trial he makes a statement that i made and it was a total fraud i never made it that s why i released the conversation because if i didn t release it people would have said that i made the statement that he made this guy is a fraud fox interview wednesday the facts no schiff spoke after trump released the rough transcript of his july phone call not before trump s claimed motive for coming out with the transcript is demonstrably untrue the white house released the account of the conversation on sept 25 schiff gave his account on sept 26 while leading a house intelligence committee hearing on the matter as the committee chairman trump has made much of schiff s account seizing on how the democrat put words in trump s mouth in describing the president s conversation with ukraine s leader schiff made clear in the hearing that he was not to be taken literally he said he was characterizing trump s conversation in not so many words attempting to describe the essence of it and doing something of a parody schiff based his account on the rough transcript he did not cause it to be released trump lawyer jay sekulow on special counsel robert mueller we had the invocation of the ghost of the mueller report i know something about that report it came up empty on the issue of collusion with russia there was no obstruction in fact impeachment trial tuesday the facts he s wrong to suggest that mueller s report cleared the trump campaign of collusion with russia nor did the report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice instead the report factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice leaving it open for congress to take up the matter or for prosecutors to do so once trump leaves office if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so mueller said after the report was released mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front sekulow during the proceedings that took place before the judiciary committee the president was denied the right to cross examine witnesses the president was denied the right to access evidence and the president was denied the right to have counsel present at hearings impeachment trial tuesday the facts that s false the committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time was split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it black colleges trump on historically black colleges and universities i saved hbcus we saved them they were going out and we saved them davos remarks tuesday the facts that s a big stretch trump signed a law in december restoring money that lapsed for several months when congress failed to reauthorize some 255 million in financing on time the money came back because senate education leaders reached a compromise on a broader dispute that had entangled financing for black schools neither the lapse nor the restoration was directly tied in any way to the trump administration the administration generally has supported historically black colleges as previous administrations have done and it s true that such schools have faced financial struggles and some have closed the trump administration has expanded access to federal support for black schools with religious affiliations and in 2018 forgave federal loans given to several of them after hurricanes but this segment of university education was not vanishing air water trump i m proud to report the united states has among the cleanest air and drinking water on earth and we re going to keep it that way and we just came out with a report that at this moment it s the cleanest it s been in the last 40 years davos remarks the facts no air quality has worsened under his administration and it s a stretch to say the u s is among the countries with the cleanest air dozens of nations have less smoggy air in the u s and other countries air is better than it was during the days of full on coal power leaded gasoline and belching smokestacks before the advent of modern pollution regulation decades ago but by multiple measures air quality has deteriorated in the last few years trump this month proposed the latest enforcement rollbacks for the bedrock environmental acts credited with beginning that clean up of u s air and water a half century ago as to water quality one measure yale university s global environmental performance index finds the u s tied with nine other countries as having the cleanest drinking water but after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america in 2017 and 2018 than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 according to an associated press analysis of epa data and deadly air particle pollution increased 5 5 in the u s between 2016 and 2018 after declining by 24 from 2009 to 2016 says a carnegie mellon university study the obama administration set records for the fewest air polluted days economy trump we have the greatest economy we ve ever had in the history of our country and i m in europe today because we re bringing a lot of other companies into our country with thousands of jobs millions of jobs in many cases davos remarks the facts his persistent depiction of the u s economy as the greatest ever is false as for jobs pouring into the country investment by foreign companies has slumped under trump according to a report by the organization for international investment a washington based association that represents foreign businesses foreign companies directly invested 268 billion into the u s economy in 2018 a decrease of nearly 220 billion from its record breaking level in 2016 when democrat barack obama was still president on the broader picture economic growth under trump is not nearly the greatest ever in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not reached on an annual basis under trump growth reached 7 2 in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and hasn t hit historically high growth rates the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low of 3 5 but the proportion of americans with a job was higher in the late 1990s wages were rising at a faster pace back then too this much is true the obama trump years have yielded the longest economic expansion in u s history but not the greatest trump the average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest for any u s president in recorded history we started off with a reasonably high rate davos remarks the facts actually trump started with a rate that if anything was reasonably low not reasonably high the unemployment rate was 4 7 when trump replaced obama in the white house that is below the long term u s average unemployment of 5 7 since the labor department began compiling the data in 1948 obama inherited a rate of 7 8 it remained high for years topping 8 for a record length of time but gradually fell to the below average level trump inherited trade trump just last week alone the united states concluded two extraordinary trade deals the agreement with china and the united states mexico canada agreement the two biggest trade deals ever made davos remarks the facts no there have been larger trade deals for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union with its liberalized trade regimen was itself formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations trump s u s mexico canada agreement is much larger though it s an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton household income trump real median household income is at the highest level ever recorded davos remarks the facts not really but it would be misleading even if it were true real median household income in 2018 matched the previous high of 63 200 first reached in 1999 that s according to adjusted figures the census bureau released to account for changes in its surveys over time trump is presumably referring to an unadjusted number that does show the 2018 figure as the highest on record either way what the data show is that income for the median household the one at the exact middle of the income distribution essentially stagnated for nearly 20 years the census data also show that household income fell sharply after the great recession then began rebounding in 2015 before trump took office associated press writers robert burns jill colvin christopher rugaber josh

telephones tsipras to pressure him into accepting the new memorandum on the troika s conditions rejected by the greeks in the referendum françois hollande does the same tsipras meets the parties that had called for a yes vote and with them draws up a position conforming to the troika s demands even though these had been clearly rejected the day before in the referendum 7 july at the brussels summit juncker is downright insulting in the presence of alexis tsipras he declares that the greek people had been asked a question about something which does not exist and asks tsipras to explain in detail what the question put to the greeks was if that would not be too much to ask tsipras replies that the government is ready to negotiate 8 july tsipras puts forward a proposal that resembles the

no partisans opposed to the 13 july agreement is repressed by the police a letter signed by 109 members out of 201 of syriza s central committee rejects the 13 july agreement which it qualifies as a

with the votes of new democracy pasok and to potami but without the votes of 39 syriza mps 32 against including varoufakis 6 abstentions 1 absence 17 july after the 13 july agreement the european

committee holds a meeting the demands upheld by the left platform in particular for a syriza congress to take place before the signature of the agreement and for a referendum within the party over

for popular mobilization and for the formation of a new political force outside syriza to oppose the policies of the tsipras government and the third memorandum 14 august vote in the hellenic parliament on the third memorandum yes 222 votes no 64 votes of which 32 are syriza members abstention 11 votes 10 syriza absent from the vote 2 syriza 20 august payment of 3 2 billion to the ecb for bonds it bought in 2010 2012 at 70 per cent of their nominal value and which had yielded it 6 1 per cent of interest interest an amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set every year on the total nominal value that is a real rate of return of about 10 per cent 20 september early elections syriza remains the main electoral force and tsipras forms a new government from august 2015 until august 2018 the third memorandum is implemented with a long list of new austerity measures and social regression european elections from 26 may 2019 victory of new democracy local and regional elections in two rounds are held 26 may and 2 june 2019 victory of new democracy which takes control of 12 of the 13 regions in crete syriza remains in power allied to pasok and most of the country s big towns including athens and thessaloniki however kke the greek communist party which gets the syriza votes keeps patras even though the kke had never called to vote for syriza early elections on 7 july 2019 victory of new democracy the party led by kyriakos mitsotakis with 40 per cent of the votes has an absolute majority in parliament syriza gets 31 5 per cent of votes golden dawn no longer has any parliamentary representation a new far right party greek solution enters parliament for the first time the party founded by varoufakis wins 9 seats 3 4 per cent of votes and the communist party has 15 mps with just over 5 per cent of votes the greek people disappointed by alexis tsipras s syriza withdrew their support syriza lost 470 000 votes compared to the january 2015 election syriza with tsipras at its head won 82 seats or a little over a fourth of the total seats in the parliament in terms of percentage the total votes won by syriza 31 5 per cent varoufakis s movement 3 4 per cent and that of the former president of the greek parliament zoe kostantopoulou 1 4 per cent which was short of the threshold of 3 per cent needed for a seat corresponds to the portion of the electorate that carried syriza to government in january 2015 signalling the disillusionment of the greek people the abstention rate strongly increased at 42 per cent it was the second highest in the country s history tsipras s capitulation led to a total rejection of politics in particular among working people and youth and yet syriza is the party that has paid the lowest price for applying the memoranda while in power the right new democracy which returned to power in july 2019 with promises of improved living conditions for the people had gone from 2 300 000 votes in 2009 to 1 100 000 in may 2012 and then increased to 1 800 000 in june 2012 to return to government pasok which had received popular support in october 2009 with 3 million votes and then agreed to the first memorandum of understanding was handed an unequivocal rejection in june 2012 with 753 000 votes and its collapse continued after that only 289 000 votes in january 2015 syriza on the other hand which in february 2015 prolonged the second memorandum of understanding and in july august 2015 presided over the adoption of the third memorandum through to its finalization in august 2018 dropped from 2 246 000 votes in january 2015 to 1 926 000 in september 2015 and 1 781 000 in july 2019 syriza s less catastrophic political fortunes show above all that the greek people are not massively turning to the right or the extreme right but also that they have responded with an attitude of resignation and adaptation to the normality created by the neoliberal purge the extreme right lost votes compared to 2015 even though a new party of the same stripe greek solution made its entry into parliament while golden dawn mired in court proceedings lost its 17 seats falling short of the threshold of 3 per cent mitsotakis s new democracy stole votes from golden dawn by putting extreme right leaders high on its tickets crushed by a debt that is still in excess of 170 per cent of gdp gdp gross domestic product gross domestic product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added the measure is notoriously incomplete for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange the gdp takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services economic growth is defined as the variation of the gdp from one period to another greece remains in a kind of protectorate status concealed behind the simulacrum of sovereignty but the people of greece have not said their last word translated by cadtm see the audit an enquiry into greek debt and more

after 18 months of a tit for tat tariff driven trade war china and the united states have emerged with a truce in the form of the first phase of a trade deal and a victory for both sides conversations among business leaders at the world economic forum annual meeting in davos switzerland suggested there may not be a phase two of the deal until after the u s election in november echoing what president donald trump said before phase one was signed yet that agreement signed january 15 offers the prospect of some economic stability a win for trump and a win china s president xi jinping even before a new coronavirus reached crises levels in china xi was facing a slowing economy which was not helped by the trade war a persistent pro democracy movement in hong kong and the embarrassing reelection of taiwan s anti beijing president tsai ing wen on january 11 beijing considers taiwan an island province xi has called reunification inevitable but the republic of china as it is officially known has been separate from the people s republic of china since 1949 taiwan has its own government democratically elected by citizens increasingly wary of china s growing rising authoritarianism for trump the trade truce offers a distraction from a senate impeachment trial he was trumpeting the deal even before it was signed telling a lake charles louisiana rally on october 11 that farmers would need more land and bigger tractors to cope with demand from china the deal commits beijing to increasing its imports of u s manufacturing energy and farm goods by 200 billion this year and next that includes larger purchases of soybeans and other farm goods expected to reach 40 billion a year although some critics wonder if china can meet the targets while xi and trump each needed a win the on the street feeling in beijing is that trump was more eager to reach a deal online commentators pointed to the power imbalance between the signatories xi s top economic aide vice premier liu he signed the trade agreement with trump others suggested the deal embarrassed xi who wanted to distance himself from the agreement before the signing the white house soft pedaled xi s absence an administration official said that the ceremony taking place on u s soil is a victory in and of itself and that a future meeting between the two leaders is still a possibility according to abc news president trump needs the truce for political reasons said edward alden a trade expert with the council on foreign relations the trade war with china has created a lot of uncertainty in the u s financial markets going into the 2020 campaign president trump wants the financial markets to be quiet and happy signing phase one could boost trump s reelection chances because the president can claim that he is a good dealmaker at campaign rallies said alden i actually do think that it s going to help him in the 2020 election it s one of the few examples in his presidency so far where he can show significant concrete results he came to the presidency saying that he is a good dealmaker said alden he hasn t actually made so many deals mostly what he has done is basically rip up the deals the previous president made on sunday trump addressed the american farm bureau federation s convention about the new u s trade agreements we did it trump said in austin texas as he recalled his campaign promises to improve trade with china and separately with canada and mexico a deal also signed last week trump fired the first salvo of the trade war in march 2018 setting tariffs on china with an effort to change what the u s called unfair trade practices such as a growing trade deficit the theft of intellectual property and the forced transfer of american technology to china at the signing ceremony trump said that china would buy agricultural products worth 40 to 50 billion over the next two years as much as double the pre trade war values according to data from the united states department of agriculture usda net agricultural income in the united states hit a record high of 123 4 billion in 2013 by 2018 that net income was expected to fall to 59 5 billion a 12 year low according to usda economic research service s farm sector income forecast and if realized a decline of 6 7 percent from the usda s 2017 projection by 2019 net agricultural income had fallen to 55 5 billion the trump administration allocated 28 billion to help farmers in 2018 and 2019 but the subsidies have not completely offset losses even though payments to farmers have exceeded what detroit s big three automakers received in the 2009 bailout which cost taxpayers 12 billion chad brown of the peterson institute for international economics told voa that having a signed deal is better for both leaders than continuing escalation of the trade war and things getting worse and worse i do think this is better than that alden said that although the u s requested inclusion of structural reforms such as beijing s subsidies to state owned enterprises and support and subsidies to the emerging industries china won by having shifted that issue to the next stage china was successful in two respects the deal provided a truce from the trade ware which is what china very much wanted said alden he added that it was more significant that on the core issues china refused what the u s was demanding many analysts have pointed out that the deal is asymmetric favoring the u s because china shall appears often throughout the agreement brown said many of the commitments that china seems to be willing to take on in this agreement i think arguably are actually good for china so it isn t just one sided cfr s alden said that china reached the agreement for economic reasons the trade war has clearly done some harm to the chinese economy than what it did on the us economy he said for economic reasons china needs the truce huang yiping deputy dean of the national development research institute of peking university said in an interview with voa on january 10 that the significance of the agreement lies in the fact that it provides a truce to the trade war ending economic uncertainty for both countries the trade war has a relatively huge impact on china huang said the biggest impact is the uncertainty of the policy especially when the two sides are always at war as a chinese entrepreneur i don t know what the tariff rate will be in the future and that will affect their investment plans the investments on both sides are declining and i personally think it is related to the trade war the second impact is more direct huang continued yes your increased tariffs not conducive to my exports which will affect the economy the growth rate of our exports in the nominal value last year fell by 10 china s gdp grew by 6 1 per cent last year the slowest rate in 29 years the government said earlier this month according to forecasts in an international monetary fund report the growth rate will slip below 6 0 in 2020 bill bishop writer of the china focused newsletter sinocism said i think president xi is happy with a truce that doesn t require china to give up too much i m not sure he needed the deal as much as trump did i think for both of them better to have even a small bad deal than no deal at all at this point and that s where we ended up
georgieva predicted that the global economy would grow 3 3 per cent this year and 3 4 per cent next year but cautioned that 3 3 per cent is not a fantastic growth it is sluggish that improvement was partly a result of a recent easing of trade tensions including the agreement this month between the united states and china she said she also cited interest rate cuts by 49 central banks and signs that industrial production around the world was starting to bottom out kristalina georgieva managing director of the international monetary fund said the global economy s prospects had improved noticeably even in the three months since the fund s annual meeting with the world bank top economic policymakers and business leaders from around the world made fairly upbeat predictions for global economic growth this year at the world economic forum but they cautioned that already low interest rates meant there was limited room to respond if new problems arose she warned that with interest rates already very low or even negative in many places it would not be easy to respond if new difficulties emerged in what appeared to be a veiled reference to possible economic consequences from a new virus in china and bushfires in australia georgieva said january had already produced events that posed new risks and that policymakers would need to be able to respond more quickly than in the past when things went wrong treasury secretary steven mnuchin alluded indirectly to the new coronavirus that led beijing to quarantine more than a dozen cities in china this week saying health challenges need to be watched closely problems at boeing which has temporarily halted production of its 737 max jets after two crashes could trim us economic growth by as much as one half to three quarters of a percentage point in the short term he said while adding that the united states still has a very robust economic outlook through 2020 europe and japan have been at the centre of concerns that negative interest rates leave little room for policymakers to ease monetary policy and stimulate growth if needed on friday the top central bankers from both places acknowledged the dangers of negative interest rates even as they said they saw no immediate opportunity to tighten monetary policy christine lagarde president of the european central bank said she welcomed figures showing lower unemployment in europe and wages rising 2 5 per cent a year but she warned that inflation had not yet risen to the point that the central bank could tighten monetary policy which would push up short term interest rates and leave room to cut them later we are seeing inflation moving a teeny tiny bit she said

s financial markets going into the 2020 campaign president trump wants the financial markets to be quiet and happy signing phase one could boost trump s reelection chances because the president can claim that he is a good dealmaker at campaign rallies said alden i actually do think that it s going to help him in the 2020 election it s one of the few examples in his presidency so far where he can show significant concrete results he came to the presidency saying that he is a good dealmaker said alden he hasn t actually made so many deals mostly what he has done is basically rip up the deals the previous president made on sunday trump addressed the american farm bureau federation s convention about the new u s trade agreements we did it trump said in austin texas as he recalled his campaign promises to improve trade with china and separately with canada and mexico a deal also signed last week trump fired the first salvo of the trade war in march 2018 setting tariffs on china with an effort to change what the u s called unfair trade practices such as a growing trade deficit the theft of intellectual property and the forced transfer of american technology to china at the signing ceremony trump said that china would buy agricultural products worth 40 to 50 billion over the next two years as much as double the pre trade war values according to data from the united states department of agriculture usda net agricultural income in the united states hit a record high of 123 4 billion in 2013 by 2018 that net income was expected to fall to 59 5 billion a 12 year low according to usda economic research service s farm sector income forecast and if realized a decline of 6 7 percent from the usda s 2017 projection by 2019 net agricultural income had fallen to 55 5 billion the trump administration allocated 28 billion to help farmers in 2018 and 2019 but the subsidies have not completely offset losses even though payments to farmers have exceeded what detroit s big three automakers received in the 2009 bailout which cost taxpayers 12 billion chad brown of the peterson institute for international economics told voa that having a signed deal is better for both leaders than continuing escalation of the trade war and things getting worse and worse i do think this is better than that alden said that although the u s requested inclusion of structural reforms such as beijing s subsidies to state owned enterprises and support and subsidies to the emerging industries china won by having shifted that issue to the next stage china was successful in two respects the deal provided a truce from the trade ware which is what china very much wanted said alden he added that it was more significant that on the core issues china refused what the u s was demanding many analysts have pointed out that the deal is asymmetric favoring the u s because china shall appears often throughout the agreement brown said many of the commitments that china seems to be willing to take on in this agreement i think arguably are actually good for china so it isn t just one sided cfr s alden said that china reached the agreement for economic reasons the trade war has clearly done some harm to the chinese economy than what it did on the us economy he said for economic reasons china needs the truce huang yiping deputy dean of the national development research institute of peking university said in an interview with voa on january 10 that the significance of the agreement lies in the fact that it provides a truce to the trade war ending economic uncertainty for both countries the trade war has a relatively huge impact on china huang said the biggest impact is the uncertainty of the policy especially when the two sides are always at war as a chinese entrepreneur i don t know what the tariff rate will be in the future and that will affect their investment plans the investments on both sides are declining and i personally think it is related to the trade war the second impact is more direct huang continued yes your increased tariffs not conducive to my exports which will affect the economy the growth rate of our exports in the nominal value last year fell by 10 china s gdp grew by 6 1 per cent last year the slowest rate in 29 years the government said earlier this month according to forecasts in an international monetary fund report the growth rate will slip below 6 0 in 2020 bill bishop writer of the china focused newsletter sinocism said i think president xi is happy with a truce that doesn t require china to give up too much i m not sure he needed the deal as much as trump did i think for both of them better to have even a small bad deal than no deal at all at this point and that s where we ended up
after 18 months of a tit for tat tariff driven trade war china and the united states have emerged with a truce in the form of the first phase of a trade deal and a victory for both sides conversations among business leaders at the world economic forum annual meeting in davos switzerland suggested there may not be a phase two of the deal until after the u s election in november echoing what president donald trump said before phase one was signed yet that agreement signed january 15 offers the prospect of some economic stability a win for trump and a win china s president xi jinping even before a new coronavirus reached crises levels in china xi was facing a slowing economy which was not helped by the trade war a persistent pro democracy movement in hong kong and the embarrassing reelection of taiwan s anti beijing president tsai ing wen on january 11 beijing considers taiwan an island province xi has called reunification inevitable but the republic of china as it is officially known has been separate from the people s republic of china since 1949 taiwan has its own government democratically elected by citizens increasingly wary of china s growing rising authoritarianism for trump the trade truce offers a distraction from a senate impeachment trial he was trumpeting the deal even before it was signed telling a lake charles louisiana rally on october 11 that farmers would need more land and bigger tractors to cope with demand from china the deal commits beijing to increasing its imports of u s manufacturing energy and farm goods by 200 billion this year and next that includes larger purchases of soybeans and other farm goods expected to reach 40 billion a year although some critics wonder if china can meet the targets while xi and trump each needed a win the on the street feeling in beijing is that trump was more eager to reach a deal online commentators pointed to the power imbalance between the signatories xi s top economic aide vice premier liu he signed the trade agreement with trump others suggested the deal embarrassed xi who wanted to distance himself from the agreement before the signing the white house soft pedaled xi

the canadian dollar exchange rates held steady at the beginning of last week with gbp cad trading around 1 69 as its close trading partner the us celebrated a bank holiday in respect of martin luther king s birthday instead canadian markets focused on us china trade developments after the newly signed phase one trade deal with markets feeling uncertainty as washington beijing relations seemed to remain precarious despite the new pact the risk sensitive canadian dollar struggled to make much headway against its peers chad brown a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics said that s a giant hole in the phase one deal and there s no way to get around it we re no closer today to resolving any of those fundamental frictions than we were before the trade war started meanwhile wednesday saw the release of the bank of canada s boc interest rate report for december which fell below consensus from 1 9 to 1 7 leaving some canadian dollar traders concerned over the health of the nations economy derek holt vice president of capital markets economics at scotiabank commented we are getting less core inflation pressure than had been expected and i think we ll see more of that as the rest of the year unfolds thursday saw the boc hold its interest rate at 1 75 but dovishly slash its growth forecasts as canada s economy lost its momentum stephen poloz the boc s governor commented advertisement there is some downside risk to the outlook for inflation i m not saying the door is not open to an interest rate cut obviously it is it is open but it hinges on how the data evolve from here the gbp cad exchange rate closed the week trading down by 0 2 around 1 718 as brexit uncertainty ahead of the 31st january official leaving data weighed on market confidence in the pound looking ahead the pound to canadian dollar gbp cad exchange rate will continue to be driven by brexit developments next week with the uk officially due to leave the eu on friday any signs that the uk could face a no deal with the eu later on this year however would prove gbp negative the bank of england s boe interest rate will also remain in focus with the bank expected to hold the rate at 0 75 however any dovish commentary in the accompanying statement would weaken the gbp cad exchange rate as the outlook for the british economy darkens the canadian data calendar is sparse next week with cad investors mainly looking ahead to friday s release of november s canadian growth figure which is expected to rise from 0 1 to 0 1 geopolitical developments will also determine the direction of the gbp cad exchange rate with the risk sensitive loonie slipping on any further flare ups between washington and beijing

in our country the average american is a law abiding person who works hard to pay his or her debts including taxes and student loans for this type of person government bailouts are unnecessary sadly presidential candidates do not seem to be interested in appealing to this type of voter advertisement for example u s senator elizabeth warren d ma has campaigned on a plan to eliminate student tuition debt this has not pleased those students and their parents who worked hard and maybe took on an extra job to pay these burdensome debts on monday one of those fathers confronted warren at a campaign event in iowa the video of their exchange went viral he said to warren my daughter is getting out of school i saved all my money she doesn t have any student loans am i going to get any money back the senator coldly responded of course not he continued so you re going to pay for people who didn t save any money and those of us who did the right thing get screwed my buddy had fun bought a car went on vacations i saved my money he made more than i did but i worked a double shift worked extra my daughter worked since she was 10 at that point the responsible father became incensed when he realized that warren was not taking his comments seriously he said to her so you re laughing although she claimed no i m not the outraged father was not convinced he concluded his brief visit by telling her yeah that s exactly what you re doing we did the right thing and we get screwed when he walked away warren immediately started talking to the next person in line but the impact of their conversation will not fade away any time soon it is reminiscent of the exchange at a 2008 toledo ohio campaign event between then presidential candidate u s senator barack obama d il and samuel wurzelbacher who became known as joe the plumber advertisement recommended wurzelbacher questioned obama about his tax plan he said your new tax plan is going to tax me more isn t it obama gave a long winded answer about how higher taxes would benefit those at the bottom and give them more money to afford plumbing services the future president said when you spread the wealth around it s good for everybody well not exactly president obama as his horrible eight year record showed the obama administration s policies might have been good for government bureaucrats and politicians but not for average hardworking americans president obama believed strongly in income redistribution as noted by americans for tax reform there were 21 different taxes passed during the obama administration clearly his onerous tax and spend agenda was harmful to the economy under president obama the country suffered through a weak economy with low growth while 9 trillion was added to the national debt even worse an additional 13 million americans needed food stamps to provide for their families in contrast tax cuts are good for almost everyone which is why the economy has responded so well to president trump s fiscal policies he has reduced both taxes and federal government regulations the response from the american people has been astounding in the last three years over 7 million jobs have been created and the nation is enjoying an unemployment rate of 3 5 the lowest in 50 years the stock market is reaching new highs on a regular basis and the consumer confidence rating is extremely strong advertisement one of the reasons president trump was elected was that the american people wanted to move away from the disastrous policies of barack obama a hillary clinton administration would have been four more years of a similar agenda if only more americans would have listened to joe the plumber his enlightening debate with barack obama gave americans a real insight into why income redistribution does not work in a similar way the iowa encounter with the outraged father has given americans a real insight into the flawed philosophy of elizabeth warren her real plan is to give bailouts and buy votes warren s proposal to pay all student loan debt will cost 640 billion and will be funded by higher taxes on the wealthy however it is more than the wealthy who will suffer if warren is elected president she offers nothing of substance to hard working americans trying to do the right thing in fact her 52 trillion medicare for all plan will lead to higher middle class taxes thanks to the iowa father who exposed warren s true agenda hopefully this will lead to millions of average americans becoming awakened to the dangers of not only her policies but also those of her fellow democratic presidential candidates jeff crouere is a native new orleanian and his award winning program ringside politics airs locally at 7 30 p m fridays and at 10 00 p m

this article is more than 4 years old the year of the rat kicked off with a foodborne viral infection spreading in central china and beyond hong kong declared a state of emergency on saturday photo by dale de la rey afp afp via getty images there is no rest for the weary if there was ever the perfect time to take profits on china now is the time china s economy is set to double in size in 2020 versus where it was 10 years ago but all of that will be put on hold if the coronavirus is not stopped soon china s government announced travel restrictions during the lunar new year celebrations and a special team set up to handle the outbreak was announced on saturday chinese premier li keqiang is now in charge of controlling and stopping the spread of the virus which has now killed 56 people as of sunday morning barclays capital expects that the outbreak will reduce first quarter gdp by just around 0 2 percentage points as holiday travel and spending is impacted the phase one trade deal and fiscal stimulus over the last several months has helped china weather the trade war but that reprieve will be undercut if this becomes another version of the 2003 sars crisis so far the outbreak is nowhere near that crisis level china s 2019 gdp is expected to have beat market consensus estimates of under 6 and come in at around 6 2 china s stock market has been in retreat since coronavirus became as big a headline as the trump impeachment trial this week the u s stock market is also falling after weeks of gains early signs suggest that quant fund algorithms hunting for key words like outbreak or even coronavirus are triggering sell offs in travel stocks american airlines shares fell over 4 on friday china s ctrip international now known as trip com group saw its shares fall by 6 9 on friday guan yi a virologist who helped identify severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 was quoted saying in the washington post that the spreading of coronavirus could be 10 times bigger than the sars epidemic because that virus was transmitted by only a few super spreaders in a more defined part of the country an electrician sets up wiring while construction workers drive excavators

2020 photo by getty images getty images we are trying to get away from over extrapolating the impact on the markets right now michael reynolds investment strategy officer glenmede coronavirus causes respiratory infections like sars and the body can often fight it back like the cold or flu in rare cases it can lead to deaths which is what is happening with this particular strain out of wuhan china china s government is building an emergency hospitals in wuhan with some 1 000 beds that is reportedly expected to be operational within the next two weeks president trump praised xi jinping on twitter over the weekend saying china was containing the outbreak so far only a handful of people who have traveled to wuhan and returned home have been contaminated by the virus a person returning from wuhan to southern california is the third case of the illness in the u s reported today residents of wuhan are on lockdown though some have tried to leave before restrictions went into place early last week around 600 cases were reported it tripled as of sunday to over 2 000 with 2 700 people under observation in wuhan for exhibiting symptoms of the virus according to a report in the south china morning post today of the known cases 25 were considered severe as of january 23 according to the world health organization it is unclear what the number is now though everyone suspects it will rise agathe demarais global economic forecaster for the economist intelligence unit says if this turns into something akin to the sars outbreak it could reduce china s real gdp growth in 2020 by half a percentage point for the year taking the official growth number under 5 5 for the first time ever news of the outbreak came on december 8 the market ignored it until late last week when two cases were found in the u s now that people have the virus in the u s it is stoking fears of a pandemic the number of people infected with the virus in china almost increased tenfold in the past few weeks with the outbreak spreading from wuhan to almost all provinces worst case scenarios abound a chinese health worker waits to check the temperature of travellers entering a train in beijing the number of cases rose to over 1 300 in mainland china on saturday photo by kevin frayer getty images getty images beware of the doomsayers barclays said in a note to clients on friday that there was a risk of the outbreak spreading wider and infecting more people than sars some 8 096 global cases were reported worldwide with 774 deaths during the lunar new year travel season about 300 000 and 800 000 chinese travel through wuhan s train stations and airport respectively this suggests that from january 10 until all transportation was halted in wuhan on january 23 there could have been between 4 and 5 million people departing wuhan barclays estimates compared to the sars outbreak that was mainly concentrated in beijing guangdong and hong kong the increased mobility of chinese people now versus then could bring more challenges to control the spread of the virus nevertheless those three cities are widely considered the epicenters of chinese commerce and mobility which is not the case with wuhan markets will be watching this closely it will give many funds managers especially the quant funds a reason to sell the dow is back under 29 000 after inching closer to 30 000 china will sell off even more on bad headlines setting up a buying opportunity once the case numbers fall interestingly enough john hopkins university conducted an experiment simulating a deadly coronavirus outbreak just last october at an event called event 201 a global pandemic exercise coronavirus may signal a time to take profits on china s a shares bull market if the virus spreads considerably this week china s stocks will tank photographer kiyoshi ota bloomberg bloomberg news the study done in collaboration with the world economic forum and the bill and melinda gates foundation predicted the virus coming out of brazilian pig farms the study imagined that a pandemic outbreak could see 65 million people infected within 18 months it was not a forecast nor a prediction that this is plausible with the wuhan virus as their test case was a more potent coronavirus than the so called 2019 novel coronavirus coming out of china china s economy was firing on all four cylinders until this happened if chinese growth drops by one percentage point an initial assessment shows that global growth in 2020 will be reduced by around two percentage points we are trying to get away from over extrapolating the impact on the markets right now says michael reynolds the investment strategy officer at glenmede a wealth manager with around 40 billion under management unless the virus spreads and things get really bad then it shouldn t be dominating anyone s investment decisions at the moment he says
columns jay ambrose syndicated columnist you almost felt sorry for them the six democratic presidential candidates who recently held their last debate before the iowa caucuses the subject of president donald trump s razzle dazzle historically stunning economy came up what were they to do concede its accomplishments demonstrate ignorance mouth falsehoods or respectably indulge in fine tuned analysis granting the obvious while pointing to shortcomings and possible improvements joe biden quickly skipped the analysis option less like a thoughtful statesman than like king kong thumping his chest he roared that working and middle class people were being clobbered they re being killed he said he had support across the board on this emphatic stance and could hardly wait to debate trump differences with others wouldn t end there however a cnn poll shows a 19 year high 76 of the american people believe that the economy is either very good or is a least somewhat good after all as varied online magazine articles point out millions of jobs have been created under trump and unemployment is the lowest in a half century just 3 5 percent which is essentially no unemployment if you want a job send an email or knock on a door people who had given up hope and were sitting at home are getting back in the hunt african americans have experienced their lowest unemployment in history and people without college degrees have the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 20 years economist stephen moore tells us wages have been going up four times faster than what we saw in the slow walk obama recovery but guess what apparently paying more attention to biden than to those in the know elizabeth warren who is worth 12 million said the economy was working only for those at the top not for anyone else in lower tones with more nuance pete buttigieg said something similar biden worth something like 9 million agreed the wealthy were the only ones doing well tom steyer the only billionaire in the room seemed on board and noted he was giving his money away bernie sanders the owner of three homes did not say he was giving two away but hissed about the greed and corruption of the corporate elite who are actually doing more for america than the political elite running for president what s reported is that income increases during the trump boom have been greatest at the bottom income level the new median household income of 66 000 is the highest in history meaning the middle class is probably grinning instead of being killed and clobbered as an example of those in tough situations getting significant boosts it has been noted that single parent mothers have seen their pocket books swell by 7 6 percent the poverty rate meanwhile is the lowest in decades trump helped make such good things happen through individual tax cuts boosting consumer confidence and also a corporate tax cut it invites investments to our country makes us more competitive with low taxed european corporations brings back money to our shores and unleashes corporations to advance their cause by such means as increasing wages the stated aim of the candidates was mostly to raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy that will slow down the boom while failing to finance ruinously expensive new programs that will increase a massive threatening debt that is just maybe trump s greatest failing lumping all six of these candidates together as if they are one would be absurd of course and amy klobuchar for instance separates herself from the others with a seeming attachment to common sense analysis but most have opposed every good move trump has made such as lessening illegal immigration and thereby affording more jobs to citizens already here or deregulating to the point of capitalism almost being capitalism again a sparkling economy with jobs conferring dignity is crucial to a long list of desired societal ends far more important for the overall public good than ever bigger government usurping our initiative trying to control more than it can ever understand and diminishing our liberty jay ambrose is a columnist with tribune news service reach him at speaktojay aol com
the register s editorial many of her ideas aren t radical they are right she must show that her vision will lift people up rather than divide them she cares about people and she will use her seemingly endless energy and passion to fight for them the outstanding caliber of democratic candidates makes it difficult to choose just one no wonder iowa democrats are unsettled each of the remaining candidates campaigning across iowa ahead of the caucuses could make a fine president each would be more inclusive and thoughtful than the current occupant of the white house each would treat truth as something that matters each would conduct foreign policy by coalition building rather than by whim and tweet the outstanding caliber of democratic candidates makes it difficult to choose just one but ultimately iowa caucusgoers need to do that who would make the best president at this point in the country s history at a time when the economic deck has become so stacked against working americans that the gap between rich and poor is the highest in more than 50 years at a time when a generation of war has stressed military families and sapped the treasury the des moines register editorial board endorses elizabeth warren in the 2020 iowa democratic caucuses as the best leader for these times more on the endorsement the board s thoughts on others in the field why we endorse opinion editor explains the purpose of today s editorial the senior u s senator from massachusetts is not the radical some perceive her to be she was a registered republican until 1996 she is a capitalist i love what markets can do she said they are what make us rich they are what create opportunity but she wants fair markets with rules and accountability she wants a government that works for people not one corrupted by cash a former harvard professor and expert in bankruptcy law she helped set up the consumer financial protection bureau the agency was specifically designed to prevent a repeat of the banking crisis and look out for little guys swindled by lenders and credit card companies she believes government should actively work to prevent and respond to abusive practices that jeopardize individuals and the country s economy warren doesn t measure the health of the economy by looking at the stock market or an unemployment rate that doesn t count the longtime jobless or chronically underemployed she measures it by how working families are doing many are not doing well and warren seeks major reforms to help them a qualification some of her ideas for big structural change go too far this board could not endorse the wholesale overhaul of corporate governance or cumulative levels of taxation she proposes while the board has long supported single payer health insurance it believes a gradual transition is the more realistic approach but warren is pushing in the right direction she believes access to health care is a human right she would make climate change a top priority and use her executive power to roll back trump administration policies that prop up fossil fuels she says corporations should have less washington influence children should be protected from gun violence child care should be affordable immigrants deserve compassion mass incarceration should end and the wealthy should pay more in taxes those ideas are not radical they are right they would improve life in america and they are generally shared by the other democratic candidates who bring their own strengths to this race former vice president joe biden would restore credibility in the white house and respect among allies around the world former south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg brings refreshingly smart youthful optimism sen amy klobuchar of minnesota offers a track record of bipartisan achievement much like warren bernie sanders champions the working class news coverage breaking down the register s endorsement iowa caucus history a complete guide plus photos of the first in the nation iowa caucuses but at this moment our country needs more we need a president who can work the levers of government to translate ideas into signed laws and effective regulations we need a president committed to bringing our troops home from open ended foreign entanglements we need a president who understands that the american dream itself is at risk the ideal that someone who works hard and plays by the rules can get ahead and that their children will do even better with warren the oval office will be occupied by someone who has made rebuilding the middle class her life s work these tall tasks will require resilience and courage in the face of inevitable attacks from the gop both during the campaign and while in office warren has proven she is tough and fearless but toughness can also be perceived as divisive as can rhetoric that vilifies the wealthy lobbyists and corporations that employ millions of people relentless attack mode threatens to further fracture a country riven by party income and racial divides helping you make your own decision voter guide don t have a lot of time find faqs on the key issues where the candidates stand and more to make your

plan to tackle healthcare climate change gun violence and more unifying the country may not be possible but to gain the support required to govern she must show that her vision will lift people up rather than divide them warren s competence respect for others and status as the nation s first female president would be a fitting response to the ignorance sexism and xenophobia of the trump oval office she is a thinker a policy wonk and a hard worker she remembers her own family s struggles to make ends meet and her own desperation as a working mother needing child care she cares about people

washington hotel with a group of donors including two men at the centre of the impeachment inquiry talking about golf trade politics and removing the us ambassador to ukraine the conversation captured on a recording made public saturday contradicted mr trump s repeated statements that he does not know the two men lev parnas and igor fruman who went on to work with the president s personal lawyer rudy giuliani to carry out a pressure campaign on ukraine the recording a video shot on mr fruman s phone during the dinner in april 2018 largely confirmed mr parnas account of having raised with mr trump criticisms of the ambassador to kyiv at the time marie yovanovitch and the president s immediate order that ms yovanovitch be removed from the post get rid of her mr trump can be heard

the two were pursuing in ukraine and then went on to discuss several themes that later became central to the pressure campaign he claimed that ambassador yovanovitch whose name he did not cite had been disparaging mr trump he said that the ukrainians were supporting the clintons all these years he even mentioned in passing the family of the former vice president joe biden the recording does not appear to introduce substantive new information about the effort to oust ms yovanovitch but it does seem to shed light on the origins of mr trump s interest in the issue and to foreshadow his administration s withholding of military assistance from the country as part of the pressure campaign it hints at the motivations of mr parnas and mr fruman who had come to believe that ms yovanovitch was opposed to their business plans in ukraine where they had tried to break into the natural gas market according to associates of the two men both of whom are soviet born us citizens and it provides a glimpse of something rarely seen top tier political donors getting a chance in an intimate setting to share their views with the president and press their agendas with him recommended trump lawyer begins impeachment defence with warning to senators during the dinner mr trump lashed out at the european union for trying to screw the united states assailed the world trade organisation as a weapon intended to harm america and lamented the globalists around him who did not care if manufacturing plants shuttered democrats are seeking trump s removal from office on the grounds that he abused his power by pressing ukraine to investigate targets of the president including mr biden and his son hunter biden mr parnas and mr fruman worked closely with giuliani in seeking information and making contacts in ukraine in support of the effort starting months after the april 2018 dinner for most of the recording the camera is pointed at the ceiling but the audio is clear early in the recording trump can be seen as he enters the private room at the trump international hotel in washington on april 30 2018 the existence of the recording and some of the conversation were first reported by abc news on friday the effort to oust ms yovanovitch would later become directly linked to the broader pressure campaign on ukraine waged by mr giuliani mr parnas and mr fruman evidence provided to house investigators showed that mr parnas was in regular contact last year with ukraine s chief prosecutor who also wanted ms yovanovitch replaced and seemed willing to trade investigations of mr biden for her removal and other signs of support from the trump administration by the time of the dinner with mr trump mr parnas and mr fruman already saw ms yovanovitch as an impediment to their efforts to get into the energy business in ukraine in the full recording released saturday mr parnas can be heard telling mr trump that he and mr fruman are in the process of purchasing an energy company in ukraine right now mr trump responds how s ukraine doing then quickly adds don t answer prompting laughter in the room after some conversation about ukraine s war with its hostile neighbour russia and its efforts to establish energy security mr trump asked how long would they last in a fight with russia i don t think very long mr parnas responded without us not very long adding they feel they re going to be ok if you support them mr parnas continued by saying that the biggest problem is corruption there and later added ms yovanovitch although not by name to a list of issues trump should address in ukraine the biggest problem there i think where we where you need to start is we got to get rid of the ambassador he said she s basically walking around telling everybody wait he s going to get impeached just wait the remark prompted laughter in the room trump asked for the ambassador s name mr fruman said i don t remember trump sounding stern then said get rid of her get her out tomorrow i don t care get her out tomorrow take her out ok do it those comments were directed at one of trump s aides who was in the room at the time mr parnas has previously said there was some additional laughter in the room at trump s remarks mr yovanovitch remained in her job for another year after trump s remarks until she was recalled on the white house s orders it is not clear whether the president changed his mind forgot about his order or was talked out of dismissing her mr parnas has recently acknowledged that he was wrong about ms yovanovitch who has denied ever disparaging trump the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment trump has previously acknowledged that he had problems with yovanovitch but has defended his actions as appropriate given that presidents have the right to name and replace ambassadors as they see fit mr parnas and mr fruman gained access to the dinner which was organised by a pro trump super pac america first action by pledging to donate 1 million 769k to the group lev parnas with donald trump in florida house judiciary committee ap the month after the event they donated 325 000 249 000 to the group through a company they had recently formed to pursue energy deals called global energy producers at the beginning of the video the person holding the phone walks around the private suite filming chatter among the guests who included donald trump jr jack nicklaus iii the grandson and namesake of the legendary golfer and barry zekelman a canadian billionaire whose steel business is mostly in the united states later mr trump said to attendees this is all sort of like off the record right during the dinner attendees fawned over mr trump and seemed to revel in their ability to ask him for direct help with business issues in the meandering conversation mr trump defended the aggressive actions he was taking against china and explained that he overruled advisers who urged him to take a softer approach because the united states was already so deeply on the losing end of the relationship they re tough but i always say when you re 500 billion down you can t lose the trade war mr trump said referring to the bilateral trade deficit the united states runs with china mr trump who has since reached a trade truce with china foreshadowed his next big trade fight taking aim at the eu the european union is a group of countries that got together to screw the united states it s as simple as that mr trump said adding that such a notion is surprising because we re all sort of from there right the conversation came just one month after trump had slapped tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium including metals imported from europe facebook screengrab shows mr parnas with son of president trump donald trump jr the campaign legal center via ap file at the dinner mr trump repeatedly praised the tariffs although he occasionally expressed concern that they could reduce the amount of available metals i don t want to be at a point where we don t have enough steel in this country he said a few minutes later he added you re going to see prices go up hopefully not too much it has been a decade since legal changes paved the way for unlimited donations to super pacs making such gatherings an even more explicit demonstration of how a large political payment can turn into access to push a special interest the donors competed for time to walk through their sometimes conflicting issues one by one pitching the president to take up their causes almost as if they were on shark tank the reality television show looking for investors in their ideas mr zekelman a canadian citizen who owns a steel tube manufacturing company that donated 1 75 million 1 39m to the political action committee supporting mr trump pushed the president on what he saw as the top two challenges facing his company cheap steel tube imports from asia and new federal rules that made it harder to find truck drivers he first urged mr trump to go even further in his effort to limit steel imports to the united states and he then questioned the rules intended to prevent fatal truck accidents by using electronic monitoring systems to limit how many hours drivers can be on the road since that dinner legislation has been introduced in the house with the co sponsorship of 12 republicans including the brother of vice president mike pence to allow smaller trucking companies to get exemptions from the rule mr zekelman is not allowed under federal law to make a contribution to the political action committee so his company donated the money through one of its subsidiaries based in the united states a manoeuvre that has generated a complaint with the federal election commission that he might have violated federal election law after the new york times wrote about the donations last year one attendee told trump that he operates a company that supplies trucks powered by compressed natural gas and urged mr trump to take steps to make the business more competitive with electric powered trucks or cars another who said he runs a company that does business with the us postal service pushed trump to consider backing the construction of a 500 mile section of highway in the united states that would be used exclusively by self driving trucks paying truck drivers he said is one of his company s biggest costs all the technology is there right now he said it is absolutely safe mr parnas did not limit his efforts to influence mr trump to ukraine he can be heard trying to engage mr trump about issues related to another business venture he would go on to pursue a plan to win marijuana retail licenses in nevada and elsewhere he appeared to ask mr trump to consider changing regulations that banks have said make it difficult for them to process transactions related to the cannabis business have you thought about allowing banking in some of these states that allow cannabis mr parnas asked what mr trump responded you can t do banking there mr parnas said banking regulations were the biggest problem for the industry and argued that the issue could help mr trump politically if the president created a bipartisan committee to study it mr parnas argued you can know what s going on and make the right decision by just putting the committee together it will give you such a boost in the midterm with a lot of the millennials mr trump expressed some scepticism saying marijuana use has led to more accidents and asserting it does cause an iq problem but donald trump jr seemed more agreeable arguing between that and alcohol as far as i m concerned alcohol does much more damage and asserting you don t see people beating their wives on marijuana it s just different a spokesman for the younger mr trump did not respond to a request for comment the new york times

was not convinced he concluded his brief visit by telling her yeah that s exactly what you re doing we did the right thing and we get screwed when he walked away warren immediately started talking to

canada free press barack obama and samuel wurzelbacher joe the plumber wurzelbacher questioned obama about his tax plan he said your new tax plan is going to tax me more isn t it obama gave a long winded answer about how higher taxes would benefit those at the bottom and give them more money to afford plumbing services the future president said when you spread the wealth around it s good for everybody well not exactly president obama as his horrible eight year record showed the obama administration s policies might have been good for government bureaucrats and politicians but not for average hardworking americans president obama believed strongly in income redistribution as noted by americans for tax reform there were 21 different taxes passed during the obama administration clearly his onerous tax and spend agenda was harmful to the economy under president obama the country suffered through a weak economy with low growth while 9 trillion was added to the national debt even worse an additional 13 million americans needed food stamps to provide for their families in contrast tax cuts are good for almost everyone which is why the economy has responded so well to president trump s fiscal policies he has reduced both taxes and federal government regulations the response from the american people has been astounding in the last three years over 7 million jobs have been created and the nation is enjoying an unemployment rate of 3 5 the lowest in 50 years the stock market is reaching new highs on a regular basis and the consumer confidence rating is extremely strong wurzelbacher questioned obama about his tax plan he said your new tax plan is going to tax me more isn t it obama gave a long winded answer about how higher taxes would benefit those

one of the reasons president trump was elected was that the american people wanted to move away from the disastrous policies of barack obama a hillary clinton administration would have been four more years of a similar agenda if only more americans would have listened to joe the plumber his enlightening debate with barack obama gave americans a real insight into why income redistribution does not work in a similar way the iowa encounter with the outraged father has given americans a real insight into the flawed philosophy of elizabeth warren her real plan is to give bailouts and buy votes warren s proposal to pay all student loan debt will cost 640 billion and will be funded by higher taxes on the wealthy however it is more than the wealthy who will suffer if warren is elected president she offers nothing of substance to hard working americans trying to do the right thing in fact her 52 trillion medicare for all plan will lead to higher middle class taxes thanks to the iowa

a very small percentage of u s citizens inequalities of the tax code health care health insurance coverage as a right not a privilege affordable housing and public education what moment in the election cycle so far have you found most significant that most members of the gop have publicly abandoned any semblance of fidelity to the party s supposedly long held values and principles i m not sure if they just paid lip service to them in the past and the principles currently espoused are what they truly believe or if they have been fully co opted by the low minded and dishonorable

particularly because the lgbtqia community tends to be disproportionately impacted by nearly all social health problems we measure in society besides that municipal state and federal deficits have me freaked out what moment in the election cycle so far have you found most significant the human rights campaign s town hall it was illuminating to hear just how much time candidates had or hadn t spent understanding the unique challenges the lgbtqia community faces why do you want to take part in this project while my experience cannot represent the entire lgbtqia community it s important to have queer voices at the table especially as we continue to see federal and civil assaults attempt to erode the progress we ve been fighting for it s also important to me to engage in a process where i m

of supporters why do you want to take part in this project i am fascinated by the reasons people choose their candidates in my community there is fairly strong support for donald trump despite everything he has done it is very curious to me that people from the same community can view a candidate with such diverse opinions what else would you like us to know as a social studies teacher i have always presented both sides of any political issue as unbiased as possible between the liberal and conservative views with my goal being to have the kids think about the issue from all perspectives that has been very difficult for me with donald trump because many of his actions should not be judged by a left right view but rather a right wrong one i believe that this election is a

views to be pretty naive and by participating in the panel i think that i will expand my understanding of different perspectives and the reasoning behind them what else would you like us to know i m

representative of american values integrity or diplomacy what traits matter to you most in a presidential candidate civility honesty respect and diplomacy the ability to listen and value other ideas viewpoints experience to make important decisions is invaluable i also respect someone who can admit when they are wrong and actually apologize what issues do you care about most since i am a health care provider affordable and comprehensive care that is directed and provided by the health care team educated in the medical needs of their patients is important to me care should not be determined by non medical personnel employed by insurance companies i do recognize the need for fraud oversight and financial responsibility however and the cost for health care in this country needs to be recognized and dealt with by bipartisan efforts understanding and compromise it is a very complex issue that isn t going to be easy to fix what moment in the election cycle so far have you found most significant the impeachment effort by the house of representatives was important and necessary to bring into focus the subversive tactics that donald trump will use for his own personal gain i m not optimistic that this will change the party first verses integrity and morals mentality but i am hoping that voters in the fall will vote for the person who best represents what good american values are why do you want to take part in this project i am disillusioned with governmental leaders who are only interested in themselves or their party affiliation not what is best and right for the well

the democratic nominee but am undecided about which candidate will be best to defeat the current administration i believe the goals and actions of trumpian republicans are not reflective of the values that are most dear to americans and certainly do not represent the traditions of the republican party i lean toward a moderate who can lead all americans respectfully and model a spirit of bipartisanship what traits matter to you most in a presidential candidate evidence of inspirational leadership public service or statesmanship above personal interest vision for the 21st century leadership experience in government foreign affairs and or military evidence of willingness to work across the aisle personal character what issues do you care about most foreign affairs and a clear long term foreign policy environment national debt gun control immigration women s rights economic social personal education job transformation and creation for the 21st century election reform what moment in the election cycle so far have you found most significant to be honest i am still waiting for an aha moment i have found the democratic debates to be tepid however two things have impressed me one there are many democratic party candidates who are very committed very capable individuals some of them have left the race i hope they will be among those chosen to lead in the next administration two the demonstration by democratic candidates of respect for one another has been a welcome change from the current administration s constant denigration of our institutions other public servants our allies even we the american people why do you want to take part in this project i will bring thoughtful respectful dialogue to the discussions that will take place over the next year what else would you like us to know the media are not covering the republican party candidates william weld mark sanford joe walsh and rocky de la fuente i would like to see more coverage of who

irish dual american irish citizen political affiliation unaffiliated supporting in 2020 if the 2020 election was held today between president donald trump and v p joe biden i would support the vice president if the election was between president trump and mayor pete buttigieg i would support mayor buttigieg however if the election was between president trump and sen elizabeth warren or sen bernie sanders reluctantly i would support president trump what traits matter to you most in a presidential candidate integrity decency and character clearly we need a strong leader with a vision of the future for the country s security prosperity and its role in the international community however all of that must be rooted in the three characteristics i ve listed what issues do you care about most there is a long list economic disparity climate change cybersecurity controlled immigration etc however my greatest concern is the seeming lack of resolve to find solutions to these and other concerns as a united country the division in our country the racial divide the economic disparity the unwillingness of some to even acknowledge that climate change is an issue that needs to be addressed is a threat to our future given the polarization of our two political parties i m not terribly optimistic that we will find the solutions that i m sure do exist what moment in the election cycle so far have you found most significant i can t think of any one moment something that i ve found interesting however is the size of the group of potential democratic presidential candidates it s also interesting that as that group began to whittle itself down more late entrants deval patrick and mike bloomberg jumped into the fray i have no allegiance or affiliation with either of the major political parties i usually confess to being a dyed in the wool independent but if the democrats are intent on defeating donald trump in november they need to develop a united front and to put all of their party s effort into doing so why do you want to take part in this project my interest is rooted in my feeling that our political system is broken once in conversation with congressman jim langevin i opined that if the best idea you had ever heard in your life was put forth by a republican as a democrat you would not be able to support it if you did your party would cut funding to your campaign or if they were really upset they would run someone against you in a primary i then pointed out that the same thing would happen to a republican congressman i am truly frustrated with the polarized tone of political discourse in our country there doesn t seem to be any middle ground nor do people seem willing able to accept that it s perfectly normal to have differences of opinion and accept that that s all they are differences of opinion what else would you like us to know my wife was born and raised in ireland where many from her family still live she also has family living in england my son and his family live in sweden i have traveled to europe both for business and to visit family more than 70 times it has always proven interesting to me to hear the european take on

grandparents political affiliation democrat supporting in 2020 i will vote for any democratic presidential candidate in 2020 right now i favor michael bloomberg or joe biden with elizabeth warren as vice president what traits matter to you most in a presidential candidate a person with a working brain intelligence the ability to think strategically and look at all sides of an issue a person who reads and acts in the best interests of the united states not his own who treats government seriously what issues do you care about most health care our relationship with iran infrastructure climate change and environmental pollution income inequality and the future of the working class in america the conservative packing of the supreme court and the lower courts what moment in the election cycle so far have you found most significant how republicans in congress have completely caved to the president mitch mcconnell s statement that the senate will ignore the impeachment resolution no matter what evidence is presented why do you want to take part in this project i m a political junkie also i m extremely concerned about about the behavior of our current president what else would you like

security national debt what moment in the election cycle so far have you found most significant impeachment why do you want to take part in this project while most politics are local the 2020 election may be one of the most important elections where national international issues may drive voters to the ballot 2020 is a critical presidential election year what else would you like us to know participation in the electoral process is a privilege and it should be a patriotic act to cast your vote name tyler piekarski age 20 lives in smithfield occupation political science major at johnson wales university marital status single identify ethnically as white political affiliation republican supporting in 2020 although i am a registered republican i m not exactly sure who i will be voting for what traits matter to you most in a presidential candidate toughness honesty and determination while the current president certainly is tough and determined he has not been honest in prior administrations when a president would lie either mistakenly or purposefully the lie would be backtracked today the lie is only further pushed that being said there is more to trump s presidency than what comes out of his mouth or what he tweets an ideal candidate for me however has all three qualities what issues do you care about most being a student graduating soon and looking for work the pinpoint is the economy the current administration has done quite well in this area secondary issues include criminal justice reform and health care president trump has done well on criminal justice reform with things like the first step act which allowed 3 100 federal inmates to be released the majority pertaining to drug related offenses there is however much more work to be done additionally obamacare needs to work better for people who cannot afford insurance and prescription drug prices are rising exponentially for no good reason what facet of the election cycle so far have you found most significant the division in the democratic party since 2016 as rep alexandria ocasio cortez stated in any other country joe biden and i would not be in the same party and yes it is true i believe if a democratic socialist earns the nomination they will not see nearly as much success as an old school democrat the old school democrat has much more appeal to independents and centrist republicans like me why do you want to take part in this project i hold views that are not common for people my age this has allowed me to bring an educated yet unique perspective into my political science classes that causes my peers to really think and question their own opinions i hope to bring the same level of thoughtful conversation to the panel what else would you like us to know in addition to my studies i play on the men s ice hockey team at school i also am a legislative ambassador for the american cancer society cancer action network of rhode island here i work with local politicians to advocate for those impacted by cancer through legislation name joe mccormack age 71 lives in east greenwich occupation retired financial adviser marital status married identify ethnically as american political affiliation republican supporting in 2020 president trump what traits matter to you most in a presidential candidate what issues do you care about most i am most interested in a candidate that shares my views on the economy national security and the future of america what moment in the election cycle so far have you found most significant i believe it will be the presidential impeachment trial why do you want to take part in this project to gain additional insight into the positions of others and to hopefully participate in civil discourse with others who do not share my views i believe our country s divide has reached a level of hostility that is unhealthy and i would like to see if i could contribute to reducing the hostility to enable people to discuss political issues without feeling threatened name manuel r manny silva jr age 53 lives in cranston occupation mechanical engineer chief engineer fellow johnson controls fire suppression marital status married identify ethnically as white political affiliation unaffiliated supporting in 2020 currently no one what traits matter to you most in a presidential candidate integrity optimism effective in leading change willing to build bridges and work to improve opportunity for all residents in the united states what issues do you care about most the economy maintaining economic growth sets the foundation for all other matters we re in unprecedented territory with regards to continued economic growth and as history as shown at some point things slow down the question will be how long and how deep will the next recession go and what will the response of the president and other political leaders be to mitigate it my second issue is foreign policy both in regards to the global economy and instability of certain regions and countries working towards a stable relationship with our economic global partners is important for long term success several countries continue to threaten the u s with missiles terrorist actions and even war that needs to stop what moment in the election cycle so far have you found most significant the impeachment of president trump while much attention has been paid to the democratic candidates the outcome of the senate trial will surely have a major impact on the 2020 election a conviction of the president will result in his removal from office which will disrupt the republican party to the point that they may not be able to put forth a strong candidate if the president is acquitted this could create a tidal wave of support for him that could carry him to re election regardless of the democratic candidate why do you want to take part in this project it seems that today s political parties are being drawn to the extremes and as an unaffiliated independent voter i believe my views on things are consistent with the silent majority i would like to give the silent majority a voice what else would you like us to know while i have lived in cranston for the past 28 years i spent the first 25 years of my life in east providence and have strong ties to both communities i m a graduate of east providence high school and the united states merchant marine academy

commentary with the phase one trade deal with the united states signed and filed china s banking regulators have begun to ease restrictions on foreign banks to enter the chinese market starting this year foreign investment banks can take full ownership stakes in chinese securities firms and that s music to the ears of banking executives who have long salivated for a slice of china s financial markets but how good of a deal is it if global banks aren t careful they can undo a decade of investor goodwill and prudent risk management following the last financial crisis foreign ownership allowance starting on april 1 foreign ownership caps for chinese securities firms will be lifted as part of the phase one trade deal that date has been accelerated from the december 2020 target date previously floated by chinese securities regulators foreign banks can now compete to be lead underwriters of debt and equity offerings own asset management firms and broker deals it s been a slow build up to this point in 2014 beijing set up the shanghai hong kong stock connect allowing investors in each market to trade shares on the other using their local brokers two years later a similar arrangement between hong kong and shenzhen was established last year a connection between london and shanghai was launched who s jumping in so far swiss bank ubs in december 2018 became the first foreign bank to gain a 51 percent majority ownership stake in its local securities venture in 2018 japanese investment bank nomura holdings received approval for a 51 percent owned chinese venture jpmorgan chase also launched a majority owned business in december 2019 others including morgan stanley and goldman sachs are in the process of establishing similar footholds the new rules clear the way for 100 percent ownership going forward what s the benefit a slice of china s 45 trillion financial services sector and the fees associated with arranging debt and equity raises investment management and mergers and acquisitions advisory today domestic banks dominate local chinese investment banking league tables the top of most lists for ipos debt and equity capital markets are all state owned entities such as citic china investment corp china securities co and guotai junan securities co at the minimum a majority or full ownership would allow global banks to consolidate their chinese revenues and profits into group earnings to appease investors a fraught path forward for global banks the first challenge is a lack of competent staff inside china top bankers in new york and london or even singapore aren t going to suddenly pack up and move to china and the ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus isn t increasing china s appeal banks can poach talent from chinese competitors but there are a ton of landmines there wall street tends to have a very short memory so let s take a walk down memory lane in 2018 ubs received a fast introduction to how beijing conducts business a ubs banker on a business trip to china was barred by authorities from leaving the country the staffer was confined and interrogated for about 24 hours in 2016 jpmorgan chase paid almost 300 million to settle a u s securities and exchange commission probe into its hiring of children of well connected chinese officials and executives the princelings scandal as it was referred to was a black eye for jpmorgan and other global banks that ran similar schemes in hopes of currying favor with local officials as international banks prepare to expand their presence in china they must also be prepared to potentially compromise existing business policies let s examine a few examples chinese communist party ccp leader xi jinping has increasingly promoted the so called civil military fusion strategy essentially it s a strategy to accelerate china into a global superpower by merging civilian industrial innovation with china s military in practice it means that any chinese domiciled company could be called upon to hand over information or otherwise assist the people s liberation army china has explicitly strengthened the corporate boards linkages to the chinese communist party said nazak nikakhtar assistant secretary for industry and analysis u s department of commerce international trade administration during testimony on jan 23 in front of the u s china economic and security review commission in washington nikakhtar was referring to the ccp increasingly calling on companies including foreign owned companies to support the creation of ccp party committees or cells within their offices china s company law which applies to both state owned and foreign owned chinese companies refers to party organizations but doesn t define their roles but such cells can influence corporate decision making and could indirectly grant the ccp de facto oversight of the company for example beijing bureaucrats through the party cells can compel banks to lend to china s state owned or private enterprises regardless of their economic merit such activities would surely be antithetical to u s and european national security or political interests and let s not get into the myriad corporate governance violations how can investors of international banks square that 1malaysia development berhad in malaysia where the bank was accused of misleading potential investors in bond issuances designed to raise cash for 1mdb the state development company lastly let s circle back to goldman sachs the investment banking giant whose most notable recent exploit in asia was the 1mdb debacle in malaysia where the bank was accused of misleading potential investors in bond issuances designed to raise cash for 1mdb the state development company on jan 23 goldman ceo david solomon told cnbc that the bank would no longer take companies public through an ipo unless the company s board of directors has at least one diverse member promoting a diversity of opinions within corporate governance is a noble goal and it should be about more than just one s skin color or gender and goldman could force some changes among u s companies looking to go public but will the bank promote the same diversity policy when it comes to its chinese clients what about boards entirely made up of ccp members whose only role is to rubber stamp party sanctioned decisions and what if those decisions hurt the bank s u s shareholders or clients for global investment banks looking to make a quick buck in china they should be careful what they wish for
could an economic slowdown sway the outcome of this year s presidential election don t bet on it said steven kyle associate professor of applied economics and management a nearly decadelong run of growth in the u s economy will peak in 2020 kyle predicts but a recession may not be evident until after the nov 3 election we are softening a bit he said but there s no sign of an immediate downturn in the next six months kyle offered his annual forecast for the national economy at the charles h dyson school of applied economics and management s 2020 agricultural and food business outlook conference jan 17 in stocking hall the conference also featured presentations by dyson professors on new york s agriculture and food sectors and what climate change means for them and detailed looks at the dairy fruit and vegetable markets u s presidents kyle said generally take too much credit and receive too much blame for ups and downs in the national economy most of the time he said they re just riding the wave as the rest of us do but negative trends tend to prompt change in the oval office as in 1980 1992 and 2008 kyle noted these things matter in the minds of voters he cautioned that economic forecasts are more art than science and no one can predict the business cycle kyle gave himself a b plus grade for last year s outlook which also anticipated a peak in the business cycle he correctly forecasted gross domestic product growth inflation and exchange rates in 2019 but didn t believe unemployment and interest rates would remain so low assessing the year ahead kyle reviewed a slate of economic indicators watched closely for signs of strength or weakness the federal reserve board s index of coincident activity a snapshot of the current economy shows a steady uphill climb since 2010 its index of leading economic indicators meanwhile which aims to predict the coincident indicators six months out is moving sideways with a slight downward trend but still in positive territory kyle said that data suggest a recession defined as two consecutive quarters of negative gdp growth is coming but won t hit until this summer at the earliest kyle said and possibly the fall which means it wouldn t appear in gdp data until well after the election recent state level indicators are fairly strong but show softness in potential swing states such as ohio pennsylvania and wisconsin kyle said personal income an important driver of consumption which represents 70 of gdp shows no sign of a slowdown the story is the same for real manufacturing and trade industries sales while industrial production appears to be moving sideways kyle said additional positive signs he noted include historically low unemployment around 3 5 low household debt and growing retail sales consumer sentiment described by the economist john maynard keynes as animal spirits is an important factor in shifting business cycles kyle said do people wake up eager to invest or worried about the future that sentiment is flat now according to a university of michigan index but could sink in reaction to bad news about trade wars or an escalation of conflict with iran for example kyle said a red flag known as a yield curve inversion when long term interest rates are lower than short term interest rates was widely reported to have occurred last year it s a strong predictor of recession but over a wide range of time kyle said in fiscal policy kyle considered that the federal reserve has little room to cut interest rates further and that the economy has absorbed any stimulus from trump s tax cut he expects washington d c to be consumed this year by impeachment proceedings and the election international trends are worrisome he said with china in recession and the european union slowing down as the united kingdom prepares to leave it several big unknowns that could hurt the economy include a potential constitutional crisis further trade war fallout or an actual war with all that in mind kyle offered with more uncertainty than usual his 2020 predictions gdp will grow at a rate of 1 5 inflation will remain low around 2 look for continued quarter point interest rate cuts and paralyzed fiscal policy unemployment will rise slightly to 3 7 or 4 leading indicators aren t showing us that there s going to be an immediate slowdown but we are near a peak in the business cycle kyle said i think we are going to have a peak next year whether it will be before the election or after i have no clue at all written by james dean

flooding at the south end of seacoast drive in imperial beach during a king tide in 2015 photo by chris helmer city of imperial beach given california s international leadership in addressing climate change it isn t surprising that voters will be asked this november to approve billions of dollars in bonds to help the state become more resilient but why settle for one ballot proposal when you can have three competing plans for climate resiliency bonds come from three sides of state government the assembly the senate and gov gavin newsom if any of these proposals are approved by voters in november the money would be broadly spent mostly to fund building and retrofitting projects and state grants to communities to prepare for the impacts of climate change that s on top of the 12 5 billion for wide ranging climate change programs in the governor s proposed budget it s anyone s guess which if any of the proposals will prevail or how lawmakers will ultimately determine the key elements of what voters will see the only certainty is that the three proposals will generate a lot of questions what is climate resilience climate scientists used to talk about mitigation changing behavior and harnessing technology but with the world unable to put the brakes on greenhouse gas emissions the current approach focuses on resilience devising strategies for coping with an unpredictable and dangerous new climate resilience projects are aimed not so much at preventing sea level rise wildfires droughts and extreme heatwaves but helping people and communities survive nevertheless this doesn t mean the state has given up trying to reduce carbon emissions said kate gordon senior climate advisor to newsom this is the opposite of throwing up our hands gordon said we need to find strategic places where infrastructure can be improved she said we need to reduce our climate risk particularly among our more vulnerable communities we are being proactive and thoughtful the stakes are high if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise by the end of this century the average acres burned from wildfires would increase by 77 percent losses could reach 18 billion from rising seas and heat related health emergencies will increase dramatically according to the state s climate change assessment what is the governor proposing newsom is seeking 4 75 billion the most of the three proposals he recommends spending 80 percent of the funding on projects that address immediate risks from floods fires and drought the rest of the money would tackle slower moving long term risks from rising seas and extreme heat what clearly distinguishes newsom s plan is an emphasis on water including groundwater management flood control reviving the salton sea and ensuring safe drinking water in communities around the state he would allocate as much as 60 percent of the bond money for water related projects particularly in the san joaquin valley an oft repeated priority for the governor low income communities around the state don t have access to safe and affordable drinking water said jared blumenfeld secretary of the state environmental protection agency communities are being forgotten blumenfeld said the bond money would be used to help cities come up with matching money to access federal funds for improving water infrastructure those projects could include upgrading sewage systems constructing water treatment plants and modernizing pipelines newsom s plan would allocate a half billion dollars to harden infrastructure making homes and buildings more able to withstand fire in other words one idea is to provide funds for fire safe building materials and roofs he would spend another 250 million for forest clearing and fuels reduction projects what are the senate and assembly proposing to begin with the two bills authors have opted for an approach of using a voter friendly name akin to the citizens for a better tomorrow and protection of puppies act in other words a bill that sounds so wholesome that it would seem shameful to oppose thus there are two identically titled bills the wildfire prevention safe drinking water drought preparation and flood protection bond act of 2020 one authored by assemblyman eduardo garcia a democrat from coachella and one by sen ben allen a democrat from santa monica garcia s legislation is being rewritten and his staff declined to provide details but it is expected to build on a previous proposal for a 3 9 billion bond that would put a premium on climate resilience projects in low income communities including expanding efforts to reduce pollutants that threaten public health allen s bill calls for a bond to raise 4 1 billion which sets aside 1 6 billion for wildfires allen called the potential for climate change impacts to the state a serious liability and said he s confident voters will want to do what it takes to respond people recognize that they are already starting to see the costs associated with climate change real dollars he said i think people who are paying attention understand this is a modest investment for the future who will differing proposals get resolved negotiation horse trading deal making arguments brinkmanship the stock and trade of sacramento lawmaking as they sit now the proposals are just the opening gambit for their authors who have laid out their priorities but expect to compromise and tailor their legislation to accommodate colleagues requests resources secretary wade crowfoot acknowledged that not all of the bond proposals are aligned but he said that the existence of three robust plans signals the intention of all parties to reach some agreement i m encouraged by the collective commitment by the governor and the legislative to advance a resilience bond crowfoot said i ve been involved in climate stuff for 20 years resilience has always a backburner issue in my conversations with legislators they understand the threats and importance of this in any event the bills must get through their houses of origin by the end of january in order to stay alive to face what are sure to be future legislative battles during the rest of the session why are bond measure always on the ballot there is almost always a bond measure on a california ballot in addition to the scores of propositions that crowd the state ballot there have been 37 bond measures before voters since 2000 california voters approved 112 billion in general obligation bonds between 2000 and 2010 but voters dug deep in 2018 approving the 4 billion california drought water parks climate coastal protection and outdoor access for all act the 3 billion veterans and affordable housing bond act and the 1 5 billion children s hospital bond act the spending spree has been such that the state still hasn t doled out some 34 billion in recent bond money why does all this cost so much and who pays it s not remotely cheap to shore up or relocate an entire coastal city as sea level rises for example but some experts say the cost of that work would be overshadowed by repair or reconstruction costs after a disaster such as storm surge occurs the u s environmental protection agency s most recent assessment of california s 20 year water infrastructure needs puts the price tag at 51 billion to repair community water systems ramp up storage and more closely monitor threats to clean residential water supplies given the state s climate to do list even billions in bond money won t do much more than spackle over needed repairs and upgrading and as per usual california taxpayers ultimately pay for bonds technically the state sells bonds to investors who often regard government bonds as a safe return then the state pays off the loan at a set interest rate depending on its credit rating california s bond rating was upgraded last year by the firm moody s for the first time in five years but there s more to it the state legislative analyst s office estimates that the cost of borrowing 1 adjusted for inflation over a 30 year repayment period ultimately pencils out at 1 40 and if you look at state issued bonds as debt as many economists do then taxpayers could eventually pay it gets a bit dizzying to consider the amounts the state is on the hook for a sobering analysis from the state legislative analyst from last november estimates that the state s annual debt service from the general fund will grow from 5 7 billion in 2019 to 6 4 billion in 2023 24 the report notes that the calculations do not include new bonds that might be authorized in the meantime such as the 15 billion school bond on the march ballot state officials argue that dollars spent in preparation for climate change impacts are much less than the future price tag but given the upfront costs and so many pressing priorities should the state nix this bond oh god no we need the money for resiliency said kathryn phillips the sierra club s california director climate change is gonna cost us a whole lot of money but we can counter that by spending a lot of money now to make sure that we are able to adapt to the changes that are already happening or we can spend much much more later we are going to spend money either way
markets gear up for another bout of risk off usd jpy targets 108 50 china coronavirus contagion risks to impact aud nzd to the downside depending on economic data boe on hold but gbp upside to be capped on brexit usd cad downside risks on a technical basis in focus there s so much we don t know about coronavirus which increases the level of concern from public health officials you i as well as

look or what authorities to trust are a little frighting the new york times calls it a rapidly expanding outbreak which has fueled fears of a global pandemic also another factor which is worrying is that there has been an uptick of these viruses over recent years including sars mers and now this pointing to outbreaks becoming more frequent in a global world the contagion factor is at an extreme

how much is the ring of fire really worth why has mining still not begun in ontario s ring of fire mineral deposit belt a decade after its discovery are the deposits worthless or are there factors beyond the control of the mining industry that are blocking progress the value of recoverable contained metal in the ground represents the sum of wealth that can be generated through the eventual sale of the commodity to the marketplace this wealth is distributed over costs of labour energy equipment taxes profits and interest payments adding to economic activity by many actors alternatively the value of the deposit to investors is represented by the profit they hope to make after paying all costs the need to apply a discount to future earnings shortens the time window on a company s investment decision to just a few years and may forbid large initial capital expenditures even if the potential for long term wealth generation is very great a third consideration is the intangible value of the deposit to society at large such as the desire to secure a local supply of a strategic metal or to increase long term economic activity in an underdeveloped region the in ground metal value of cr chromite alone can easily be calculated from ni 43 101 compliant resource estimates and metallurgical studies for ring of fire chromite deposits collectively these deposits contain at least 34 8 mt metric tons of cr that would be recoverable into a direct shipping lump and chip ore with a dollar value once it is contained within ferrochrome of about 117 billion in canadian dollars article content chromiterecoverable from the measured and indicated resources in the ring of fire deposits could supply the entire north american demand for new cr production for 58 years adding 2 billion to canada s economy each year in current dollars at current prices the deposits remain open at depth noront resources obtained a 2012 feasibility study for the eagle s nest ni deposit also in the ring of fire and predicated on the ontario government s 2012 promise to build a road to the deposit an eight year mining plan for eagle s nest with a discounted payback of mining infrastructure costs excluding the road in 2 5 years gave an estimated net present value then of about 500 million assuming similar underground bulk mining methods through the same mining infrastructure as eagle s nest one can estimate total costs on the order of 250 per ton to mine and transport 3 000 t day of direct shipping chromite ore to a port or smelter including payments to maintain the road itself this price is competitive with profitable current prices for similar ore at the shipping terminal worldwide for ore which must then be shipped halfway around the world to china at 3 5 to four mw hr ton of metal chromium smelting is highly electricity intensive it would be more profitable to avoid shipping costs and add value by smelting in canada where industrial electricity costs as little as one third the price in china and does not rely on coal what intangible benefits could arise from establishing a secure north american supply of chromite the global cr market is dominated by producers in south africa kazakhstan and turkey who send most of their ore and or ferrochrome product to china for processing conditions in these nations pose obvious trade and security risks to the supply of cr which is a critically important and irreplaceable metal for stainless steel and superalloys just before then ceo lourenco goncalves of cliffs natural resources announced in 2014 that cliffs would abandon its 550 million investment in the ring of fire at an eventual 95 per cent discount he said that the original cliffs acquisition was made based on the belief that a connection would be built between the ring of fire and the south they sold the deposits to noront resources when they came to believe that the road would not be built in the next 50 years the massive road network in southern canada is entirely financed by the public in the service of industry why not a road to the ring of fire the reason nothing is happening in the ring of fire has nothing to do with the value of the deposits it is entirely due to the inability of governments at all levels including first nations provincial and federal to reach consensus on land tenure and development plans it is time for all of these groups to negotiate in good faith and govern effectively for their stakeholders so that the value of the ring of fire can be realized while providing access and development opportunities to a marginalized region of ontario james mungall is a professor of economic geology at carleton university he was noront s chief geologist during the discovery phase of exploration but has no financial conflict of interest related to the ring of fire
fake news the chief executive of lufthansa has called it but his counterpart at air france calls it the airline industry s biggest challenge so does the president of emirates it s got to be dealt with what they re talking about is flight shame the guilt caused by the environmental impacts of air travel specifically the carbon emissions it s the reason teen climate change activist greta thunberg refused to fly to new york to address the united nations climate action summit in september taking a 14 day sea voyage instead epa in thunberg s native sweden flight shame flygskam has really taken off motivating people to not take off last year 23 of swedes reduced their air travel to shrink their carbon footprint according to a wwf survey swedish airport operator swedavia reported passenger numbers at its ten airports in october were down 5 on the previous year the potency of this guilt is what put lufthansa s head carsten spohr on the defensive at an aviation industry conference in berlin in november airlines should not have to be seen as a symbol of climate change that s just fake news he declared our industry contributes 2 8 of global co₂ emissions as i ve asked before how about the other 97 2 are they contributing to global society with as much good as we do are they reducing emissions as much as we do does he have a point let s consider the evidence how bad are aviation co₂ emissions the international council on clean transportation the same organisation that exposed volkwagen s diesel emissions fraud estimates commercial aviation accounted for 2 4 of all carbon emissions from fossil fuel use in 2018 so it s true many other sectors contribute more it is also true airlines are making efforts to reduce the amount of carbon they emit per passenger per kilometre australia s aviation industry for example has reduced its emissions intensity by 1 4 a year since 2013 however the icct estimates growth in passenger numbers and therefore total flights means total carbon emissions from commercial aviation have ballooned by 32 in five years way faster than un predictions on that trajectory the sector s total emissions could triple by 2050 alternatives to fossil fuels a revolution in aircraft design could mitigate that trajectory the international air transport association suggests the advent of hybrid electric aircraft propulsion similar to how a hybrid car works taking off and landing using electric power by about 2030 35 could reduce fossil fuel consumption by up to 40 fully electric propulsion after that could eliminate fossil fuels completely even with the advent of electric airliners by mid century the huge cost and long lifespan of commercial jets means it could still take decades to wean fleets off fossil fuels a shorter term solution might be replacing fossil fuels with sustainable aviation fuels such as biofuels made from plant matter but in 2018 just 15 million litres of aviation biofuel were produced less than 0 1 of total aviation fuel consumption the problem is it costs significantly more than standard kerosene based aviation fuel greater use depends on the price coming down or the price of fossil fuels going up www shutterstock com pricing carbon this brings us to the role of economics in decarbonising aviation an economist will tell you for most goods the simplest way to reduce its consumption is to increase its price or reduce the price of alternatives this is the basis of all market based solutions to reduce carbon emissions one way is to impose a tax on carbon the same way taxes are levied on alcohol and tobacco to deter consumption as well as to raise revenue to pay the costs use imposes on society the key problem with this approach is a government must guess at the price needed to achieve the desired reduction in demand how the tax revenue is spent is also crucial to public acceptance in france opposition to higher fuel taxes led the government to instead announce an eco tax on flights this proposed tax will range from 1 50 about a 2 40 for economy flights within the european union to 18 about a 29 30 for business class flights out of the eu among those who think this price signal is too low to make any real difference is sam fankhauser director of the grantham research institute on climate change and the environment in london trading and offsets greater outcome certainty is the reason many economists champion an emissions trading scheme also known as cap and trade whereas a tax seeks to reduce carbon emissions by raising the price of emission a trading scheme sets a limit on emissions and leaves it to the market to work out the price that achieves it one advantage economists see in emissions trading is that it creates both disincentive and incentives emitters don t pay a penalty to the government they effectively pay other companies to achieve reductions on their behalf through the trade of carbon credits the european union already has an emissions trading scheme that covers flights within the european economic area but it has been criticised for limiting incentives for companies to reduce emissions because they can cheaply buy credits such as from overseas projects such as tree planting schemes www shutterstock com this led to the paradox of scheme delivering a reported 100 million tonnes of reductions offsets from europe s aviation sector between 2012 and 2018 even while the sector s emissions increased a better solution might come from a well designed international trading scheme the basis for this may be the global agreement known as the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation already 81 countries representing three quarters of international aviation activity have agreed to participate what seems clear is that guilt and voluntary action to reduce carbon emissions has its limits this is suggested by the data from sweden the heartland of flight shame behind the 5 reduction in passenger numbers reported by swedavia is a major difference between domestic passengers down 10 and international passengers down just 2 that might have something to do with the limited travel alternatives when crossing an ocean for most of us to consider emulating greta thunberg by taking a sailboat instead the price of a flight would have to be very high indeed this article is

this could bring the shares back to earth in a hurry chinese electric car maker nio nio 2 00 has seen its shares soar over the past several weeks thanks to strong fourth quarter sales and good news about electric vehicle subsidies from the chinese government but it has a big problem the company is far from profitability and it s now perilously low on cash as of sept 30 it said it had just 274 3 million in cash remaining down from 1 123 billion at the end of march a report last week that the company was close to a deal to get 1 billion in new cash gave the stock a big boost but that report turned out to be both premature and exaggerated what should auto investors make of all this let s look closer there might be a deal but it won t be enough nio s shares surged 16 last week after a chinese business news outlet reported that the company had secured 1 billion in new financing from guangzhou based gac group one of china s major automakers nio quickly clarified that discussions with gac were ongoing and no deal had yet been reached that s still true since then gac group has confirmed that it is in fact considering an investment in nio as reported by a chinese business news outlet last week but it said that any investment it makes in nio won t exceed 150 million far below the 1 billion that had been reported and much less than nio needs to keep the lights on for longer than a few more months that hasn t dissuaded the nio bulls though as i write this the company s american depositary shares are up over 75 in the past month nio s q3 results the raw numbers nio is based in china and reports its results in yuan it also provides u s dollar equivalents for key figures in its earnings release using the exchange rate that was in effect on the last business day of the third quarter sept 30 at which time 1 was equal to 7 1477 yuan metric q3 2019 q2 2019 q3 2018 revenue 257 million 219 7 million 214 million vehicles delivered 4 799 3 553 3 268 gross margin negative 12 1 33 4 7 9 operating profit loss 337 1 million 469 9 million 409 1 million adjusted operating profit loss 327 2 million 456 5 million 346 2 million net income loss 352 8 million 478 6 million 1 42 billion net income loss per american depositary share 0 35 0 47 1 51 where things stand with nio now on one hand after a long delay nio finally reported its third quarter 2019 results on dec 30 and aside from its cash balance the numbers were decent the company lost about 2 5 billion yuan 352 8 million in the third quarter significantly improved from both the second quarter and the year ago period thanks to stronger vehicle sales and tighter cost controls significantly improved from both the second quarter and the year ago period thanks to stronger vehicle sales and tighter cost controls nio s december sales numbers were also pretty good the company delivered 3 170 vehicles in december down slightly from a year ago but up 25 4 sequentially that december result gave nio a total of 8 224 deliveries in the fourth quarter ahead of its own guidance and up 3 1 from its excellent result in the year ago period earlier in january the chinese government said it won t cut its subsidies for electric vehicle buyers in 2020 that s bullish for ev sales in china generally which as we ve seen in other markets have proved to be price sensitive on the other hand in late december nio made it clear that it can t get through 2020 without additional cash even if gac puts in 150 million that isn t enough the deal with gac is not a sure thing nio thought that it had secured financing in october but the deal fell through at the last minute after the investor became concerned about nio s ability to survive the takeaway for investors here s the upshot if nio can secure sufficient financing on non onerous terms say 750 million or more then its near term prospects are probably bright and the stock could go much higher but that has yet to happen and it s not a sure thing trade carefully
by jonathan cook in nazareth two recent images encapsulate the message behind the dry statistics of last week s report by the world bank on the state of the palestinian economy the first is a poster from the campaigning group visualizing palestine that shows a photoshopped image of central park eerily naked amid new york s skyscrapers the park has been sheared of its trees by bulldozers a caption reveals that since the occupation began in 1967 israel has uprooted 800 000 olive trees belonging to palestinians enough to fill 33 central parks the second a photograph widely published last month in israel is of a french diplomat lying on her back in the dirt staring up at israeli soldiers surrounding her their guns pointing down towards her marion castaing had been mistreated when she and a small group of fellow diplomats tried to deliver emergency aid including tents to palestinian farmers whose homes had just been razed the demolitions were part of long running efforts by israel to clear palestinians out of the jordan valley the agricultural heartland of a future palestinian state ms castaing s defiance resulted in her being quietly packed off back to europe as french officials sought to avoid a confrontation with israel the world bank report is a way of stating discreetly that israel is gradually whittling away the foundations on which the palestinians can build an independent economic life and a viable state the world bank report is a way of stating discreetly what castaing and other diplomats hoped to highlight more directly that israel is gradually whittling away the foundations on which the palestinians can build an independent economic life and a viable state this report follows a long line of warnings in recent years from international bodies on the dire economic situation facing palestinians but significantly the world bank has homed in on the key battleground for an international community still harbouring the forlorn hope that the israeli palestinian conflict will end in palestinian statehood the report s focus is on the nearly two thirds of the west bank known as area c that is exclusively under israeli control and in which israel has implanted more than 200 settlements to grab palestinian land and resources the world bank report should be seen as a companion piece to the surprise decision of the european union in the summer to exclude entities associated with the settlements from eu funding both in turn reflect mounting frustration in european capitals and elsewhere at israeli intransigence and seeming us impotence europeans in particular are exasperated at their continuing role effectively subsidizing through aid an israeli occupation with no end in sight with israel and the palestinians forced back to the negotiating table since july and after the us secretary of state john kerry warned that this was the last chance for a deal the international community is desperate to exercise whatever small leverage it has on israel and the us to secure a palestinian state the world bank s concern about area c is justified this is the location of almost all the resources a palestinian state will need to exploit undeveloped land for future construction arable land and water springs to grow crops quarries to mine stone and the dead sea to extract minerals and archaeological sites to attract tourism with access to these resources the palestinian authority could generate an extra income of 3 4 billion us dollars a year increasing its gdp by a third reducing a ballooning deficit cutting unemployment rates that have reached 23 per cent easing poverty and food insecurity and helping the fledgling state break free of aid dependency but none of this can be achieved while israel maintains its chokehold on area c in violation of the 1993 oslo accords israel neither wants the palestinians to gain the assets with which to build a state nor intends to lose the many material benefits it has accrued for itself and the settler population in area c israel has entrenched its rule in area c precisely because of its wealth of natural resources israel neither wants the palestinians to gain the assets with which to build a state nor intends to lose the many material benefits it has accrued for itself and the settler population in area c it is its treatment of area c that gives the lie to israeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu s claim that he has been pursuing economic peace with the palestinians in lieu of progress on the diplomatic front rather the palestinian description of israeli policy as economic warfare is much nearer the mark during the oslo period the disparity between israel s per capita gdp and that of the palestinians has doubled to 30 000 dollars and the world bank says that the palestinian economy is rapidly shrinking the 11 per cent growth that netanyahu took credit for in 2011 has crashed to 1 9 per cent in the first six months of this year in the west bank gdp has actually contracted by 0 1 per cent despite its resources area c is being starved of palestinian funds investors are averse to dealing with israeli military authorities who invariably deny them development permits and severely restrict movement the image of the french diplomat in the dirt is one that symbolises their own likely treatment if they confront israel in area c palestinian farmers meanwhile cannot grow profitable crops with the miserly water rations israel allots them from their own acquifers aware of the many obstacles to developing area c palestinian officials have simply neglected it concentrating instead on the densely populated and resource poor third of the west bank under their full or partial control the hope was that this would change when kerry announced in the run up to the renewed talks a plan to encourage private investors to pour in 4 billion to develop the palestinian economy but the reality as the report notes is that there can be no serious investment in the economic heartland of area c until israel s control ends in effect the world bank is saying that kerry s plan and the role of the international community s envoy tony blair the so called quartet representative is not only misguided it is positively delusional the quartet has been trying to revive the palestinian economy to usher in the conditions for statehood the world bank s view is that there can be no palestinian state let alone economic revival until israel is forced out of the territories the international community has it all back to front the idea that a financial lifeline whether kerry s plan or netanyahu s economic peace is going to smooth the path to the conflict s end is an illusion peace and prosperity will come only when palestinians are liberated from israeli control a version of this article first appeared in the national abu dhabi the version here is published by permission of jonathan cook
the senate committee in a statement says while it will ultimately speak through its report next tuesday it has prevailed on vice president jewel howard taylor to attend the president s annual message on monday january 27th and return to work as we resolve these concerns in line with its oversight responsibilities monrovia a senate special committee constituted by pro temp albert t chie to delve into concerns of vice president jewel howard taylor and revert to the wisdom of plenary for possible redress says it will report its findings on tuesday january 28 2020 the committee which comprises of sen nyonblee karnga lawrence liberty party as chairperson sen varney g h sherman unity party cape mount sen commany b wesseh unity party river gee sen sando d johnson npp bomi and sen abe darius dillon liberty party montserrado county is meanwhile urging the vice president to end her boycott and attend monday s annual message of president george manneh weah the committee in a statement says while it will ultimately speak through its report next tuesday it has prevailed on the vice president to attend the president s annual message on monday january 27th and return to work as we resolve these concerns in line with its oversight responsibilities the committee has also called on surrogates of the government to end its abuse on talk radio against the vp we will also urge government functionaries to stop using radio stations to abuse the vice president as the office of the vice president is the second highest in our land and must be respected at all times the statement said article 58 of the constitution states the president shall on the fourth working monday in january of each year present the administration s legislative program for the ensuing session and shall once a year report to the legislature on the state of the republic in presenting the economic condition of the republic the report shall cover expenditure as well as income the vice president has raised alarm in recent days suggesting that her office is being deliberately strangulated by the ministry of finance and development planning in an exclusive interview with frontpageafrica this week the vp said sadly over the past two years the budgetary allocation for office operations to include funds for special projects has not been paid to my office this has hampered my ability to positively impact and contribute to the liberian women s agenda a commitment made by our government generally and by me specifically this inability to remain thus engaged as one of liberia s female leaders has grieved me greatly so though the operational payment for my office deals with items needed to make my office functional it also includes funds allocated for women empowerment and scholarships for girls education the mfdp responding to an fpa inquiry this week dismissed suggestions that it is selectively targeting the vice president s office the ministry of finance has made payments to all branches of government within the limits of what is possible the office of the vice president has received more than us 3 million in both compensation and goods and services since 2018 fiscal challenges have led to austerity that have affected senior leadership of all branches of government the ministry is not selective in administering payments but follows rule based fiscal rules that aim to contain the deficit and assure budget credibility the vp disagrees telling fpa this week that the office of the deputy speaker which is lower than hers was paid a whopping us 150 000 in december by the ministry said the vp knowing that other offices have been paid their operations so they re better functioning offices that are lower than the office of the vice president have received all of what they have requested i found out that two payments were made on december 23 the first payment was made in two checks to the office of the deputy speaker of operations in the amount of owner 150 000 united states dollars and then made it house of representatives for some other payment and i was just totally blown out of water and this is not particularly to the individual in our office and i want to be clear because you know politics is a really tricky thing so it wasn t about him it was about the fact that the ministry of finance could make a us150 000 payment for operations for the office of the deputy speaker and they have not done that for me in two years the withholding of funds according to the vp has led her to go begging around for help i over the last two years have had to go beyond my means you know get to friends to help us oh please repair this car and i just got tired doing it and when i found out that somehow you know this funding that is so important to my office was also being paid to other offices i felt that there was something wrong and that i had to even though i had engaged them from time to time that i had to actually do something so people will know that i believe is an error and it has strangulated my work
staten island n y while staten island has often been thought of as a bedroom community for commuters who work for big businesses based in manhattan the borough has been making strides on the job front in recent years in fact a recent study provided by the u s bureau of economic analysis stated that staten island s gross domestic product gdp increased 7 8 between 2017 and 2018 from 13 46 billion to 14 5 billion the 7 8 has staten island outpacing the nation said jacob hinson an economist with the u s bureau of economic analysis he said the borough saw job growth during that time period in the following industry categories state and local governments warehousing arts and entertainment recreation transportation services that put the borough at the top of the the state s 62 counties the report said and economists say the influx of new warehousing jobs such as the 4 000 created at amazon s fulfillment center in bloomfield contributed to the spike in the borough s gdp not only does this data show staten island is no longer the forgotten borough but that richmond county s economy is growing in a very specific way said abraham unger who holds a doctorate degree and is an associate professor and director of urban programs in the department of government politics at wagner college in addition the demand for apartments and commercial properties across the borough has fueled a variety of jobs from construction to finance its largest source of growth in real estate and rental leasing is clearly creating what is called agglomeration that is the clustering of secondary support industries such as finance construction and warehousing said unger who also is a visiting research scholar at fordham university and senior research fellow at nyu marron institute of urban management manhattan the influx of middle class jobs and more affordable housing than the other four boroughs will likely ensure more economic growth in the future unger said this demonstrates something very profound about the current state of the broader american economy in middle class areas such as staten island even those communities that have lost industry there is the very real possibility of growth through the development of properties but that kind of development needs to be more diversified than the kind of single minded high end luxury development that manhattan and brooklyn saw until recently he added america needs rentals and warehousing for example and that kind of economic development supports middle class jobs growth in the trades such as construction staten island is likely pointing us to a healthier more sustainable form of economic growth than the gentrification and blatantly elitist kind of building that has gone on in major urban centers for the last three decades he added follow tracey porpora on facebook and twitter

supporting those initiatives percolating in the legislature over the years herbert and lawmakers disagreed over key political issues including medicaid expansion when lawmakers came back and would override a hebert veto niederhauser said it wasn t a black eye for the governor it is hard to be very tough with a legislature that has a supermajority niederhauser said that is just the nature of the

runs entirely on renewable energy luis sinco los angeles times advertisement but he saw his worldview writ in the disparities between the hill and the flatter environs he noticed how the streets on the hill were well paved while his were cracked and cratered and how after a snowstorm the plows always hit the hill first the working class might wallow in drifts for days he listened to residents and small business owners complain of a good ol boy network running the city with little input from ordinary citizens this tension all came to the surface in a massive project backed by the longtime democratic mayor gordon paquette developers wanted to turn the industrial wasteland that was the city s lakefront shuttered tank farms mills docks and rail yards into a complex of upscale condos and hotels the progressives in town and many other residents wanted that shoreline turned into a public space sanders railed against the project with the slogan burlington is not for sale on election day to the shock of even his most ardent supporters sanders won by 10 votes when he parked his old beater in the mayor s parking slot early on he got a ticket recalls his wife jane o meara sanders the officer didn t believe that could be the mayor s car his opponents including 11 of the 13 city aldermen decried his victory saying he would destroy the economy they stymied his every move rejected every appointment he made and even fired his secretary he maneuvered around them by creating various mayor s councils that turned into enduring city services when more fellow progressives swept onto the city council in subsequent elections the city sanders walks around today is shaped in many ways by the policies he set in motion as mayor from the tree canopy to the string of parks and bike path along the waterfront bernie sanders mayoral administration started an economic development agency that helped buoy small businesses with loans and lure employers to burlington luis sinco los angeles times advertisement while his leftist rhetoric never stopped his governance was more often practical occasionally even conservative rejecting a property tax hike for instance or putting the city s insurance out for competitive bidding he really paid attention to the nuts and bolts of the city government says peter clavelle who served as sanders chief of economic development and succeeded him as mayor for 15 years carrying on his left leaning agenda sanders arts council spurred a thriving arts and music scene his administration started a little league in the old north end a volunteer network that planted thousands of trees and an economic development agency that helped buoy small businesses with loans and lure employers like burton snowboards a tribute to the late jazz musician joe burrell a large presence in the burlington music scene who influenced other local artists including the band phish luis sinco los angeles times bernie is gung ho about small business says ben cohen the ben of ben jerry s which has launched two bernie flavors in recent years along with phish food he came in and had this attitude of what can the city government do to serve the city better sanders did not conjure all of these ideas on his own he listened to community leaders formed neighborhood councils hired technocrats he trusted and took their advice advertisement one of the strengths that lasted even to this day is citizen engagement says brenda torpy whom sanders appointed housing director he d tell us to go to the neighborhoods go to the organizations and find out what they want and need during his eight years as mayor council meetings were packed and raucous and voter turnout surged in 1979 just over 7 000 people voted in the mayoral election in 1987 over 12 000 did one of his main goals was to rein in real estate speculation and gentrification to keep the tenants in their homes in 1984 he established the burlington community land trust which started buying and renovating rundown rental properties on the old north end the model was to rent them at fixed rates or sell them at low prices while retaining ownership of the land and sharing in any value appreciation now called the champlain housing trust it is the largest such nonprofit in the nation and has 8 of the city s housing units no nut or bolt was too small when the snow fell he would be out with the plows riding with the driver jane sanders says while he brought free public concerts to battery park on the bluff sanders also went on a campaign to stop noisy late night college parties even accompanying police to dress down the revelers large old homes line a street in bernie sanders longtime hometown of burlington vt luis sinco los angeles times advertisement sanders is credited by many for the success of the city which regularly lands high on lists of the most livable towns in the country a ranking that forces him to perpetually confront what he sees as a great evil gentrification outside investors and vacation home buyers see burlington s housing stock as a golden opportunity to his dismay sanders has taken his fight for tenants and working class homeowners to larger arenas after his eight years as mayor he brought his sharp edged persona to the house of representatives where he served as vermont s independent congressman from 1991 to 2007 before taking a seat in the senate that year stu mcgowan a longtime developer of affordable housing on the old north end climate change activist and the head umpire of the baseball league that sanders started says the senator s cantankerousness is part of his charm in vermont where honesty frugality and independence are exalted and polish is seen as pretentiousness stu mcgowan a longtime activist in burlington says bernie sanders cantankerous persona plays well in vermont where people aren t impressed by polish but by honesty frugality and independence luis sinco los angeles times you d go to fundraising parties and he d just be sitting in the corner and you d go to talk to him and he d do exactly what you see him doing now he d lecture you for three hours and then he d be like see ya mcgowan who is much more

ever since brazil opposed indiaâ s move in 1961 to liberate goa from portuguese rule the relationship between the two nations have been lukewarm at best and frosty at worst editor s note this article was first published on 24 january 2020 it is being republishedâ in viewâ of the 71st republic day parade where brazilian president jair bolsanaro is in attendance as the chief guest a resource rich brazil and an energy hungry india with no major dissonances in their worldview congruity in middle power status and facing similar challenges in their development curve should be much more than just â strategic partnersâ locked in a buyer seller relationship that they aren t owed as much to baggage of history as lack of imagination from leadership advertisement ever since brazil opposed indiaâ s move in 1961 to liberate goa from portuguese rule the relationship between the two nations have been lukewarm at best and frosty at worst things didnâ t change much even though trade relationship eventually developed and diplomacy intensified ties still remained hostage to history even as both nations became members of plurilateral fora such as brics ibsa g 20 and in multilateral bodies such as the united nations thereâ s a chance to reset that relationship and introduce a new dynamic as brazilian president jair bolsonaro arrives in india as the chief guest for republic day on a four day tour from 24 to 27 january the moment is opportune prime minister narendra modi and bolsonaro are strong leaders propelled by massive mandates they are not bound by traditional thinking both are adept at risk taking and spending political capital on issues that they reckon are central to their nationsâ interests advertisement this indicates that both are decisive leaders unafraid to take big bold decisions advertisement in indiaâ s case the leadership has shown the imagination to match its ambition to project power and safeguard indiaâ s interests india is finally showing a willingness to work hard and break old dogmas indiaâ s foreign policy has become more proactive while not deviating from the central autonomous tenet asâ foreign minister subramanyam jaishankar said during a recent occasion stressing on the need for greater engagement with the world â i just came from serbia and i was honestly embarrassed to learn that i was the first foreign minister who had ever visited serbia after it broke away from yugoslavia i hear this story over and over againâ the first task is to be visible to be active to engage to be able to hear smell touch the world for yourself if you donâ t do that your instincts are not going to be good they are not going to be sound â advertisement this greater engagement leads to greater confidence matched with a growing economy india finally has the confidence to shape outcomes in international relations instead of being defensive we see a reflection of this mindset in indiaâ s willingness to step up the relationship with brazil and vitalize ties announcing bolsonaroâ s visit a statement from indiaâ s ministry of external affair s lays out the fulcrum of greater engagement â india and brazil share a close and multifaceted relationship our bilateral relations are based on a common global vision shared democratic values and a commitment to foster economic growth of both countries â advertisement both nations understand that they have a dovetailing of interests what kind of dovetailing while brazil â â which has seen ties with neighbouring argentina deteriorate â â looks to upgrade its trade partnership with india and tap its rapidly growing market new delhi is keen to exploit possibilities in resource rich latin america plus thereâ s oil advertisement reports indicate that bolsonaro will bring with him a delegation comprising seven ministers and 62 businessmen including 12 defence industry leaders both nations may sign over 20 agreements in defence energy agriculture healthcare and mineral sectors the defence sector claims a report inâ economic times may witness joint production and industrial collaboration advertisement india one of the worldâ s biggest oil importers needs to diversify its energy needs from the gulf iraq remains its top supplier but in recent times india has started importing more crude from the us a 72 percent jump in first five months of 2019 the instability in gulf us iran confrontation and threats of secondary sanctions from the us may drive india further away from middle east this is where brazil one of worldâ s top 10 oil exporters sees a big opportunity advertisement both nations may also sign a bilateral investment treaty a priority for the modi government and â allow investments in each otherâ s pension funds to help business processes and encourage the flow of investments â the visit will also provide opportunity for greater intra brics synergy a non western grouping that allows a platform for countries such as brazil russia india china and south africa to adhere to multi polarity as opposed to multilateralism advertisement despite the inherent difficulties of brics including clashing ideology and interests of member nations flexibility and room for autonomous stance has helped sustain the platform bolsonaroâ s visit may not only enhance bilateral trade that stands at a meagre 8 2 in 2018 19 greater intra brics cooperation will be an area of priority for both leaders despite its many disappointments as former foreign secretary krishnan srinivasan writes inâ the hindu brics has delivered the new development bank that â has so far financed over 40 projects at a cost of 12 billion the brics countries are also developing a joint payments mechanism to reduce foreign trade settlements in us dollars â advertisement as the brazilian president arrives in india on maiden visit and attends the republic day parade he will get an opportunity to brush up his personal association with modi both leaders accord importance to personal chemistry in bilateral ties and share similar notions about their nations having a greater say in global commons and reformation of global institutions such as united nations or international monetary fund advertisement the bolsonaro modi association has also been much talked about in western media both are polarising figures and favourite whipping boys of liberal western media that see in their rise a threat to â liberal democracyâ even though both leaders have been chosen by their people and have reposed faith in democratic institutions while modi remains western mediaâ s favourite villain bolsonaroâ s landslide win in 2018 has been blamed among other things on fake news and whatsapp both leaders think little of such criticism and it could be one of the reasons why modi extended an invitation to bolsonaro with such synergy in interests the stage is set for india and brazil to stitch a stronger more multifaceted relationship
browned palm leaves fan over the white sand beaches of caneel bay resort peeling paint buckles on the exterior walls of roofless cabins inside white curtains still knotted drape like ripped cobwebs from windows and mold matted mattresses sag without their frames a back door swings wide long considered the crown jewel of st john a small emerald island found among the u s virgin islands and cut with curved bays and set against the turquoise waters of the caribbean the 170 secluded acres of caneel bay once drew luminaries from john steinbeck and lady bird johnson to meryl streep and mitch mcconnell more than 15 000 people annually visited the property nestled within the virgin islands national park and home to a handful of endangered species the four star eco resort established by the rockefeller family was one of the first in the united states it was a first class experience without the pretentiousness of the rest of the world said bob rice a guest from needham massachusetts who stayed at the property with his family eight times you just got nature at its best two weeks in september 2017 changed that hurricanes irma and maria both category 5 storms flogged st john ripping apart structures and flooding what remained even as other accommodations in the region have reopened caneel bay remains in tatters those who have ventured inside recall a newspaper on the front desk dated september 2017 just before the first storm scheduled weddings marked the chalkboard they say and rats could be seen scurrying across the wine cellar floor while the hurricanes ripped apart the resort s infrastructure in a matter of hours the storms lingering aftermath laid bare its long festering problems which include an unorthodox land use agreement with the federal government possible environmental contamination that predated the storms and contentious relationships between the staff and management together they have stalled the resort s reconstruction and hurt the island s economy caneel bay s future is tied up in a dispute between its owner cbi acquisitions which took over the resort in 2004 and the national park service which owns the land where caneel bay sits cbi acquisitions says it cannot afford to rebuild unless it gets an extension of its right to control and use the resort property from the park service in turn the park service says that the agreement needs to be renegotiated and that it needs to complete environmental testing on hold since 2014 to determine the extent of mercury arsenic and other hazardous chemicals previously found on the property as well as the cost of the cleanup the first ferry over bob natt and his wife helen honeymooned at caneel bay in 1971 as their family grew they spread to several cabins staying some 30 to 35 times over 46 years getting a christmas cottage on caneel bay was like something you put in your will it was that hard to get said natt who lives in easton connecticut to stay in its 166 simply furnished cabins guests spent an average of 727 a night and up to almost 2 000 for christmas in 2017 natt 71 has maintained contact with management i said the day you open i want to be on the first ferry over in 2017 less than two weeks after employees waved the last boatload of guests from the dock before an annual eight week hurricane season closure hurricane irma hammered st john and neighboring st thomas splintering trees ripping off roofs twisting metal frames and collapsing walls twelve days later hurricane maria swallowed what little remained including the initial repair efforts dumping up to 3 feet of rain atop the devastation at other hotels the push to rebuild was almost immediate the westin st john resort villas one of the few other resorts on st john employed staff to help with the cleanup which took 16 months the resort fully reopened to guests last february at first caneel employees who made up 7 of the u s virgin islands total employment in the hotel and restaurant sector putting caneel on par with walmart in terms of the number of jobs created in a state by a single employer according to a congressional white paper expected they would be similarly involved in their resort s clean up as they had with previous storms but this time hundreds of workers found themselves unemployed unionized employees some who had worked on the resort for decades received termination letters by mail the whole community is hurting said theresa germain a housekeeper who retired months before the storms and worked on the resort about 35 years but no rebuilding began cbi acquisitions a limited liability company based in connecticut and created to purchase the resort has the rights for land use and occupancy until 2023 gary engle the resort s principal owner has refused to rebuild without an extension of those rights saying it is not worth the investment of about 100 million to rebuild most units and install new electrical wiring and plumbing among other tasks lack of clarity is the major problem with the resort right now engle said because without fixing the uncertainty there s no money that s going to be invested in this property the destroyed resort is an inescapable sight on such a small island only the main entrance has been repaired for 20 visitors can take a golf cart ride from there to honeymoon beach the only beach out of seven associated with the resort that has reopened the golf cart trundles over a potholed path jagged with bare pipes and winds past an eerie landscape of deserted cabins overgrown brush and felled trees the rockefellers arrive in 1952 while cruising along the caribbean laurance spelman rockefeller the grandson of the oil tycoon and a successful venture capitalist and conservationist docked at caneel bay where he bought the stock of an existing resort rockefeller and another developer soon began buying real estate around the resort despite reservations from some residents they planned to create a national park eventually rockefeller turned over more than 5 000 acres to the national park service which today owns almost two thirds of the island in 1956 rockefeller opened an environmentally focused resort in the heart of the newly created virgin islands national park on land he kept for himself theovald moorehead a native of st john and local lawmaker who successfully petitioned congress to prevent islanders land from being condemned for the park grew concerned over changes he witnessed on the island we like tourists but we will not sacrifice ourselves to make this a happy place for tourists he wrote in 1958 what we want is a happy island happy for everyone including ourselves as the years passed the caribbean a popular destination for u s travelers accustomed to luxury hotels saw an influx of big brand hoteliers and cruise lines many benefited from offshore tax incentives from the u s virgin islands economic development commission an organization geared toward aiding companies establishing themselves in the u s virgin islands caneel bay plantation as it was then called offered an alternative experience beyond chain brand amenities with cabins just footsteps from the water and an informal communal teatime where guests mingled each day on the veranda members of the rockefeller family donated the property to the park service in 1983 but based on a vaguely written legal condition they continued operating the resort through one of their nonprofits untethered by typical national park standards the retained use estate contract was 13 pages long bare bones compared to current park leases and immediately caused confusion within a year the interior department which oversees the park service explained the parks had very little authority on the property based on the expansive nature of the rockefellers reserved rights the resort changed hands several times eventually causing even rockefeller concerns he wrote to the park service director in 1988 it is my sincere hope that you would not consider granting any request to extend the retained use estate at caneel bay he added that his intention and expectation was for the rue to expire by 2023 an asbestos pipe stalled testing and no answers caneel bay resort was one of the region s few eco lodge resorts featuring a reverse osmosis water plant and environmentally friendly upgrades and the land agreement with the park service which receives no payment for use of the federal property along with long extended benefits from the economic development commission made the resort s business position enviable shortly after cbi acquisitions took over the land agreement in 2004 engle started looking for ways to extend the rue that was an essential part of the transaction engle said of the initial purchase but despite the benefits he said it wasn t all positive particularly the lack of clarity around what would happen after the agreement expired in 2023 a bill passed by congress in 2010 would enable a 40 year extension following routine environmental testing and contingent on the company s relinquishing the mandates of the rue initial environmental tests were conducted in 2012 and 2014 but while some results were made public those referring to potential environmental problems were not those unpublished assessments reviewed by the new york times and national parks traveler a news website covering the parks and other protected areas that provided the times with some documents noted among other concerns a release of hazardous substances or petroleum products throughout the property including excessive amounts of mercury and arsenic a pipe with approximately 30 asbestos considered a high amount was also found and an employee told the assessors that more pipes existed no health problems have been documented but the park service which requested the tests as part of departmental policy noted that more tests were needed the public was never alerted and the follow up tests never happened caitlin klevorick a cbi acquisitions spokeswoman said by email that the company believed that if any potential environmental problems exist they resulted before cbi acquisitions became a landholder caneel bay was fully committed to and did operate the resort to ensure guests safety she said michael litterst acting chief of public affairs for the park service declined to be interviewed noting both pending legislation and potential litigation but stephanie roulett a park service spokeswoman said by email that the agency had tried to get on the property multiple times and had not been granted access she said that while they could implement a legal procedure they had thus far not significantly pushed back a series of letters between engle and the park service obtained by the times illustrates negotiations at loggerheads in april 2019 engle sent the interior department a letter claiming the right to immediately and automatically take over the property unless the government paid 70 million and assured indemnification from all environmental liabilities the agency rejected engle s ultimatum repeating a request for additional environmental testing klevorick the resort spokeswoman said the company is committed to further cooperation with the nps in the next phase of an environmental site investigation the storm before the storms even before the hurricanes forced the resort to shut down some longtime employees had become increasingly frustrated germain the housekeeper and local union representative said when she started working at the resort in the 1980s staffers had a sense of pride but that diminished under new management as time passed it got a dose of bad management she said they treated us really poorly really bad down to the last employees who had been full time said that their hours declined in favor of seasonal workers klevorick said that cbi acquisitions always prioritized full time employees over seasonal workers management also instituted a security policy in which it checked employees bags before they left the resort each day sheryl parris who has been president of the local union representing caneel bay since 2012 said that the very insensitive practices evoked hard feelings caneel also attempted to reduce its full time staff successfully negotiating in april 2017 with the economic development commission to decrease the minimum number of employees with full time status to 230 a reduction of almost 100 people additionally despite continuing to collect local tax breaks including a 90 income tax exemption and full exemptions from other taxes the resort did not actually employ most of their workers year round all but a few dozen were let go each year for a six to eight week hurricane season closure beginning in 2009 other resorts on nearby islands have also implemented such closures but previous owners of caneel bay had never done seasonal layoffs at a public hearing the day the workforce agreement was announced one commission member expressed reservations about the habitual layoffs but the resort continued the practice i want to do the right thing months after the storms and with the resort moldering on site stacey plaskett the usvi delegate in congress introduced a bill allowing a 60 year extension on the rue to coax the owners to rebuild missing from the bill s text any mention of required environmental testing some resort staff and the greater st john community felt excluded from the process and the bill was not well received particularly by some former employees who say they still never received paychecks for their last two weeks of work klevorick said the company was unaware of any employees who had not received payment but recognizes that immediately following the storms it was very chaotic as plaskett s approval rating plummeted on st john her working relationship with engle also deteriorated he appeared uninterested in working with the community she said engle acknowledged community frustration maybe when i was down there i didn t handle it as well as i could have he said i want to do the right thing for the employees i want to do the right thing for the community and the virgin islands then about a year after the storms engle invited former employees and others onto the resort property for a meeting several people there recalled him framing the rebuild as contingent on the bill s passage parris recalled employees offering to return and clean up but instead she said of the company they were waiting for that bill and so they kept all the employees waiting the bill died plaskett said she has no plans to introduce new legislation negotiations between cbi acquisitions and the park service are ongoing last month the company submitted a proposal to the service and roulett said this month that the agency was currently drafting its own 60 and you re doing good the loss of tourism has had lasting effects on bars and restaurants as well as cabdrivers who made the bulk of their money taking guests to dinner at places like zozo s at the sugar mill an italian restaurant once located at caneel before everybody was making something recalled everett wilkinson one cabdriver now everyone is hustling for whatever they can make it s why most people on the island have two or three jobs just to survive previously he often brought in 200 a day now 60 and you re doing good he said the taxi service right now is down to nothing we re sitting right by the dock and we re not moving although engle insists that the rebuild has been stalled by uncertainty about what will happen to the property in 2023 court documents filed by certain underwriters at lloyd s of london suggest that the company was grossly underinsured so far the company has received 32 million for a claim of total devastation following hurricane irma although the resort s insurable value was more than twice that engle said that the groups are arbitrating the company s claim for a separate payout for hurricane maria saying that the damage incurred by the second storm was distinct from the first a claim the insurance company has contested arbitration is scheduled for april around the time that he was promoting plaskett s bill to former employees in 2018 engle said in an interview with a local reporter that he was in a position of power with an insurance payout that did not require him to rebuild i could take that money and walk away or i can take that money and reinvest and maybe put up a little more capital and turn this into something special engle said without caneel bay st john is going to implode recalling that interview engle said that as a matter of economic fact the resort brought thousands of visitors to st john and that the amount of money that was spent by caneel guests both at the resort and in the shops and the restaurants in cruz bay was very significant for an island with several thousand people i was basically stating the obvious he concluded we didn t have hurricanes like this a new environmentally sustainable resort is set to open in early 2021 on lovango cay an island belonging to st john and a 10 minute boat ride from caneel bay mark and gwenn snider who own resorts in martha s vineyard and nantucket are designing the solar and wind powered resort we re really hoping to just have people do what they do best snider said come down help the economy not to impose on the community and travel with just their footprints the hurricanes that battered the caribbean in recent years have brought to light the region s deeper issues with economies overly dependent on tourism on st john all of those issues have come to a head keep in mind this has never happened in the virgin islands before said parris the union president we didn t have hurricanes like this we had hurricanes where trees would fall but we went back to work and still caneel bay s devoted patrons hope one day they can return natt the longtime guest said his family has returned to the region three times since the storms although not to st john we have not found anything on the caribbean that has been as good he said without caneel the grandkids didn t want to go c 2020 the new york times company
we have suddenly arrived at a tricky stage in global economic development emerging markets are losing their dynamism after a remarkable three decade long run during which they caught up rapidly with advanced economies moreover rekindling this vigour requires a new economic strategy but where will such a model come from and who will provide the intellectual leadership the latest economic forecasts from the international monetary fund and the world bank are sobering pointing to protracted slowdowns across the board in china india sub saharan africa and latin america of course alarmism about the end of growth might be as overblown as past hype
san diego america s infrastructure has been crumbling ever since george washington crossed the frozen delaware river on a leaky boat that seems to be a bipartisan truth and every four years presidential candidates remind us of the claim most recently democratic candidate pete buttigieg unveiled an infrastructure plan that magically settled on the same trillion dollar price tag that candidate donald trump announced in 2016 but is america s infrastructure really so bad after all amazon has figured out how to deliver everything from bananas to cough drops within hours of a customer s click no one could do that in george w bush s era much less george washington s it is a mistake simply to count up potholes and rusty rivets on bridges and then declare a crisis in fact the department of transportation reports that the number of bridges deemed poor has fallen by 22 per cent over the past decade regardless we should be assessing what i call infrastructure load and instead ask whether more goods and services are being delivered on time under the lens of infrastructure load we see the gig economy unleashing a slew of new services that work around potholes uber and lyft boost the economy s efficiency because fewer vehicles are sitting idle the san diego international airport cut the ribbon on a beautiful 128 million parking garage in 2018 you can easily slide into a

united states which infrastructure era do you really prefer of course america does have too many potholes and too much traffic for many people commuting can be miserable long distance commuters are 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression according to a rand study radio host howard stern once launched a new york gubernatorial campaign by promising to ban daytime road construction stern s plan no doubt lifted listeners spirits and drew some voters one solution is telecommuting a gallup poll reports that 31 per cent of employees now work remotely still something must be done for those who do travel the answer is not simply more government spending in a remarkable boston globe essay former us treasury secretary lawrence summers documented how bureaucratic bungling and special interest niggling delayed a repair of the 232 foot 71 metre anderson bridge in cambridge massachusetts by five years and inflated the cost by 5 million the original bridge built in 1912 took 11 months to build there are no shovel ready infrastructure projects when special interests grab hold of the shovels the nimby not in my backyard mentality that opposes new infrastructure will not subside when delivery by drone is perfected nimby will become namby not above my backyard but alternatives exist for starters more cities and states should adopt congestion pricing which makes it more expensive to drive during peak hours a recent study showed that stockholm s congestion pricing cut air pollution by 5 15 per cent and reduced asthma attacks while also making it easier to move around the city second we should repeal laws that unnecessarily drive up construction costs including the davis bacon act of 1931 which requires federal contractors to pay prevailing wages usually defined as union wages even though 87 per cent of construction workers are non union the congressional budget office estimates that repeal would free up an additional 12 billion for federal projects over the next ten years finally to spur construction of new toll roads which are usually financed through municipal bonds a special tranche of small denomination bonds should be issued to local residents as an incentive to buy the bonds drivers would be given a lifetime free pass on the new road this would fund more routes build civic pride and give investors downside protection even if the bond prices fell

we can t just drill our way out of the problem that was the oft repeated phrase of president barack obama who throughout his presidency argued that the key to beating higher gasoline prices was to subsidize alternative energies such as solar and wind it was a common sentiment from those who fretted that the world had reached peak oil and that america was simply doomed to become increasingly reliant on a few big international oil producers for a rapidly dwindling resource it also played well into the narrative that fossil fuels were inherently evil destroying the planet by escalating climate change but the doomsayers were wrong thanks in large part to american ingenuity and technological innovation the script has been flipped and the dividends have been enormous recent events in the middle east underscore the dramatic change that s occurred it s been remarkable that following the september attacks on saudi arabian oil facilities and the recent u s strike on iranian gen qassim suleimani oil prices have remained more or less stable this is a huge departure from what has transpired after major incidents in the middle east in the past as foreign policy s c k hickey noted the august 1990 iraqi invasion of kuwait led to a surge in the price of oil from 15 a barrel that month to 40 by october 65 68 adjusted for inflation as of 2019 in february 2003 the lead up to the u s invasion of iraq once again led to a spike in prices to nearly 40 a barrel or around 55 in today s dollars a level that hadn t been seen since the gulf war this time was different why u s oil production has boomed in the past decade thanks largely to innovation in the use of fracking which has allowed the u s to tap into not only enormous amounts of shale oil but also natural gas and other petroleum resources in fact u s production has ramped up so much that in 2018 the u s became a net exporter of oil for the first time in nearly 75 years perhaps even more incredibly for a brief time at the end of 2019 the u s surpassed saudi arabia to become the world s top oil exporter that of course produced jobs and a boon to the american economy but it also created the conditions for a global oil market more resistant to supply and price shocks which were sometimes created by opec nations many of the latter are in the middle east or generally hostile to the u s but now a world suddenly deprived of say iranian oil can rely increasingly on u s oil as political scientist walter russell mead wrote for the wall street journal the middle east is now a region being fundamentally reshaped by drillers in texas pennsylvania north dakota and elsewhere as my colleague nick loris an expert on energy and environmental policy has noted the huge increase in domestic oil production doesn t mean that the u s is truly energy independent we are still very much affected by the global supply and the actions of countries abroad nevertheless the surge in production has transformed the american economy and given the u s an invaluable tool in foreign relations that has transpired in spite of efforts by the obama administration and the left to strangle an industry they fundamentally dislike an effort that would be stepped up massively if the so called green new deal became law the green new deal a badly disguised trojan horse for socialism and of dubious environmental benefit would end and reverse the oil production advances that have been such a broad based benefit for the u s economy hopefully the strong economy and stable oil markets amid turmoil in the middle east will serve as a reminder that reversing the incredible advances in oil drilling of the past decade would be a huge mistake
browned palm leaves fan over the white sand beaches of caneel bay resort peeling paint buckles on the exterior walls of roofless cabins inside white curtains still knotted drape like ripped cobwebs from windows and mold matted mattresses sag without their frames a back door swings wide long considered the crown jewel of st john a small emerald island found among the u s virgin islands and cut with curved bays and set against the turquoise waters of the caribbean the 170 secluded acres of caneel bay once drew luminaries from john steinbeck and lady bird johnson to meryl streep and mitch mcconnell more than 15 000 people annually visited the property nestled within the virgin islands national park and home to a handful of endangered species the four star eco resort established by the rockefeller family was one of the first in the united states it was a first class experience without the pretentiousness of the rest of the world said bob rice a guest from needham massachusetts who stayed at the property with his family eight times you just got nature at its best two weeks in september 2017 changed that hurricanes irma and maria both category 5 storms flogged st john ripping apart structures and flooding what remained even as other accommodations in the region have reopened caneel bay remains in tatters those who have ventured inside recall a newspaper on the front desk dated september 2017 just before the first storm scheduled weddings marked the chalkboard they say and rats could be seen scurrying across the wine cellar floor while the hurricanes ripped apart the resort s infrastructure in a matter of hours the storms lingering aftermath laid bare its long festering problems which include an unorthodox land use agreement with the federal government possible environmental contamination that predated the storms and contentious relationships between the staff and management together they have stalled the resort s reconstruction and hurt the island s economy caneel bay s future is tied up in a dispute between its owner cbi acquisitions which took over the resort in 2004 and the national park service which owns the land where caneel bay sits cbi acquisitions says it cannot afford to rebuild unless it gets an extension of its right to control and use the resort property from the park service in turn the park service says that the agreement needs to be renegotiated and that it needs to complete environmental testing on hold since 2014 to determine the extent of mercury arsenic and other hazardous chemicals previously found on the property as well as the cost of the cleanup the first ferry over bob natt and his wife helen honeymooned at caneel bay in 1971 as their family grew they spread to several cabins staying some 30 to 35 times over 46 years getting a christmas cottage on caneel bay was like something you put in your will it was that hard to get said natt who lives in easton connecticut to stay in its 166 simply furnished cabins guests spent an average of 727 a night and up to almost 2 000 for christmas in 2017 natt 71 has maintained contact with management i said the day you open i want to be on the first ferry over in 2017 less than two weeks after employees waved the last boatload of guests from the dock before an annual eight week hurricane season closure hurricane irma hammered st john and neighboring st thomas splintering trees ripping off roofs twisting metal frames and collapsing walls twelve days later hurricane maria swallowed what little remained including the initial repair efforts dumping up to 3 feet of rain atop the devastation at other hotels the push to rebuild was almost immediate the westin st john resort villas one of the few other resorts on st john employed staff to help with the cleanup which took 16 months the resort fully reopened to guests last february at first caneel employees who made up 7 of the u s virgin islands total employment in the hotel and restaurant sector putting caneel on par with walmart in terms of the number of jobs created in a state by a single employer according to a congressional white paper expected they would be similarly involved in their resort s clean up as they had with previous storms but this time hundreds of workers found themselves unemployed unionized employees some who had worked on the resort for decades received termination letters by mail the whole community is hurting said theresa germain a housekeeper who retired months before the storms and worked on the resort about 35 years but no rebuilding began cbi acquisitions a limited liability company based in connecticut and created to purchase the resort has the rights for land use and occupancy until 2023 gary engle the resort s principal owner has refused to rebuild without an extension of those rights saying it is not worth the investment of about 100 million to rebuild most units and install new electrical wiring and plumbing among other tasks lack of clarity is the major problem with the resort right now engle said because without fixing the uncertainty there s no money that s going to be invested in this property the destroyed resort is an inescapable sight on such a small island only the main entrance has been repaired for 20 visitors can take a golf cart ride from there to honeymoon beach the only beach out of seven associated with the resort that has reopened the golf cart trundles over a potholed path jagged with bare pipes and winds past an eerie landscape of deserted cabins overgrown brush and felled trees the rockefellers arrive in 1952 while cruising along the caribbean laurance spelman rockefeller the grandson of the oil tycoon and a successful venture capitalist and conservationist docked at caneel bay where he bought the stock of an existing resort rockefeller and another developer soon began buying real estate around the resort despite reservations from some residents they planned to create a national park eventually rockefeller turned over more than 5 000 acres to the national park service which today owns almost two thirds of the island in 1956 rockefeller opened an environmentally focused resort in the heart of the newly created virgin islands national park on land he kept for himself theovald moorehead a native of st john and local lawmaker who successfully petitioned congress to prevent islanders land from being condemned for the park grew concerned over changes he witnessed on the island we like tourists but we will not sacrifice ourselves to make this a happy place for tourists he wrote in 1958 what we want is a happy island happy for everyone including ourselves as the years passed the caribbean a popular destination for u s travelers accustomed to luxury hotels saw an influx of big brand hoteliers and cruise lines many benefited from offshore tax incentives from the u s virgin islands economic development commission an organization geared toward aiding companies establishing themselves in the u s virgin islands caneel bay plantation as it was then called offered an alternative experience beyond chain brand amenities with cabins just footsteps from the water and an informal communal teatime where guests mingled each day on the veranda members of the rockefeller family donated the property to the park service in 1983 but based on a vaguely written legal condition they continued operating the resort through one of their nonprofits untethered by typical national park standards the retained use estate contract was 13 pages long bare bones compared to current park leases and immediately caused confusion within a year the interior department which oversees the park service explained the parks had very little authority on the property based on the expansive nature of the rockefellers reserved rights the resort changed hands several times eventually causing even rockefeller concerns he wrote to the park service director in 1988 it is my sincere hope that you would not consider granting any request to extend the retained use estate at caneel bay he added that his intention and expectation was for the rue to expire by 2023 an asbestos pipe stalled testing and no answers caneel bay resort was one of the region s few eco lodge resorts featuring a reverse osmosis water plant and environmentally friendly upgrades and the land agreement with the park service which receives no payment for use of the federal property along with long extended benefits from the economic development commission made the resort s business position enviable shortly after cbi acquisitions took over the land agreement in 2004 engle started looking for ways to extend the rue that was an essential part of the transaction engle said of the initial purchase but despite the benefits he said it wasn t all positive particularly the lack of clarity around what would happen after the agreement expired in 2023 a bill passed by congress in 2010 would enable a 40 year extension following routine environmental testing and contingent on the company s relinquishing the mandates of the rue initial environmental tests were conducted in 2012 and 2014 but while some results were made public those referring to potential environmental problems were not those unpublished assessments reviewed by the new york times and national parks traveler a news website covering the parks and other protected areas that provided the times with some documents noted among other concerns a release of hazardous substances or petroleum products throughout the property including excessive amounts of mercury and arsenic a pipe with approximately 30 asbestos considered a high amount was also found and an employee told the assessors that more pipes existed no health problems have been documented but the park service which requested the tests as part of departmental policy noted that more tests were needed the public was never alerted and the follow up tests never happened caitlin klevorick a cbi acquisitions spokeswoman said by email that the company believed that if any potential environmental problems exist they resulted before cbi acquisitions became a landholder caneel bay was fully committed to and did operate the resort to ensure guests safety she said michael litterst acting chief of public affairs for the park service declined to be interviewed noting both pending legislation and potential litigation but stephanie roulett a park service spokeswoman said by email that the agency had tried to get on the property multiple times and had not been granted access she said that while they could implement a legal procedure they had thus far not significantly pushed back a series of letters between engle and the park service obtained by the times illustrates negotiations at loggerheads in april 2019 engle sent the interior department a letter claiming the right to immediately and automatically take over the property unless the government paid 70 million and assured indemnification from all environmental liabilities the agency rejected engle s ultimatum repeating a request for additional environmental testing klevorick the resort spokeswoman said the company is committed to further cooperation with the nps in the next phase of an environmental site investigation the storm before the storms even before the hurricanes forced the resort to shut down some longtime employees had become increasingly frustrated germain the housekeeper and local union representative said when she started working at the resort in the 1980s staffers had a sense of pride but that diminished under new management as time passed it got a dose of bad management she said they treated us really poorly really bad down to the last employees who had been full time said that their hours declined in favor of seasonal workers klevorick said that cbi acquisitions always prioritized full time employees over seasonal workers management also instituted a security policy in which it checked employees bags before they left the resort each day sheryl parris who has been president of the local union representing caneel bay since 2012 said that the very insensitive practices evoked hard feelings caneel also attempted to reduce its full time staff successfully negotiating in april 2017 with the economic development commission to decrease the minimum number of employees with full time status to 230 a reduction of almost 100 people additionally despite continuing to collect local tax breaks including a 90 income tax exemption and full exemptions from other taxes the resort did not actually employ most of their workers year round all but a few dozen were let go each year for a six to eight week hurricane season closure beginning in 2009 other resorts on nearby islands have also implemented such closures but previous owners of caneel bay had never done seasonal layoffs at a public hearing the day the workforce agreement was announced one commission member expressed reservations about the habitual layoffs but the resort continued the practice i want to do the right thing months after the storms and with the resort moldering on site stacey plaskett the usvi delegate in congress introduced a bill allowing a 60 year extension on the rue to coax the owners to rebuild missing from the bill s text any mention of required environmental testing some resort staff and the greater st john community felt excluded from the process and the bill was not well received particularly by some former employees who say they still never received paychecks for their last two weeks of work klevorick said the company was unaware of any employees who had not received payment but recognizes that immediately following the storms it was very chaotic as plaskett s approval rating plummeted on st john her working relationship with engle also deteriorated he appeared uninterested in working with the community she said engle acknowledged community frustration maybe when i was down there i didn t handle it as well as i could have he said i want to do the right thing for the employees i want to do the right thing for the community and the virgin islands then about a year after the storms engle invited former employees and others onto the resort property for a meeting several people there recalled him framing the rebuild as contingent on the bill s passage parris recalled employees offering to return and clean up but instead she said of the company they were waiting for that bill and so they kept all the employees waiting the bill died plaskett said she has no plans to introduce new legislation negotiations between cbi acquisitions and the park service are ongoing last month the company submitted a proposal to the service and roulett said this month that the agency was currently drafting its own 60 and you re doing good the loss of tourism has had lasting effects on bars and restaurants as well as cabdrivers who made the bulk of their money taking guests to dinner at places like zozo s at the sugar mill an italian restaurant once located at caneel before everybody was making something recalled everett wilkinson one cabdriver now everyone is hustling for whatever they can make it s why most people on the island have two or three jobs just to survive previously he often brought in 200 a day now 60 and you re doing good he said the taxi service right now is down to nothing we re sitting right by the dock and we re not moving although engle insists that the rebuild has been stalled by uncertainty about what will happen to the property in 2023 court documents filed by certain underwriters at lloyd s of london suggest that the company was grossly underinsured so far the company has received 32 million for a claim of total devastation following hurricane irma although the resort s insurable value was more than twice that engle said that the groups are arbitrating the company s claim for a separate payout for hurricane maria saying that the damage incurred by the second storm was distinct from the first a claim the insurance company has contested arbitration is scheduled for april around the time that he was promoting plaskett s bill to former employees in 2018 engle said in an interview with a local reporter that he was in a position of power with an insurance payout that did not require him to rebuild i could take that money and walk away or i can take that money and reinvest and maybe put up a little more capital and turn this into something special engle said without caneel bay st john is going to implode recalling that interview engle said that as a matter of economic fact the resort brought thousands of visitors to st john and that the amount of money that was spent by caneel guests both at the resort and in the shops and the restaurants in cruz bay was very significant for an island with several thousand people i was basically stating the obvious he concluded we didn t have hurricanes like this a new environmentally sustainable resort is set to open in early 2021 on lovango cay an island belonging to st john and a 10 minute boat ride from caneel bay mark and gwenn snider who own resorts in martha s vineyard and nantucket are designing the solar and wind powered resort we re really hoping to just have people do what they do best snider said come down help the economy not to impose on the community and travel with just their footprints the hurricanes that battered the caribbean in recent years have brought to light the region s deeper issues with economies overly dependent on tourism on st john all of those issues have come to a head keep in mind this has never happened in the virgin islands before said parris the union president we didn t have hurricanes like this we had hurricanes where trees would fall but we went back to work and still caneel bay s devoted patrons hope one day they can return natt the longtime guest said his family has returned to the region three times since the storms although not to st john we have not found anything on the caribbean that has been as good he said without caneel the grandkids didn t want to go c 2020 the new york times company
