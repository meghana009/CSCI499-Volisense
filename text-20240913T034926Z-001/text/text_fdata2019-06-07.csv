dollar recovers mildly today continuing to stabilize from this week s selloff the greenback is staying in range established earlier except versus canadian there is some optimism on the outcome of us mexico negotiations or at least tariffs won t go up to the worst case of 25 down the road together with expectations on fed rate cut sentiments improved notably which is clearly reflected in the rebound in the stock markets nevertheless today s non farm payroll report could be the ultimate test for investor sentiments for the near term in the currency markets canadian is currently the strongest one for today helped by mild recovery in oil prices sterling is the second strongest followed by dollar euro is the weakest one but it s generally bounded in range only aussie is the second weakest after poor housing data for the week yen overtook dollar s position as worst performing while dollar is second than aussie kiwi is the strongest one followed by canadian and then franc technically usd cad s breach of 1 3357 support is a sign of bearish reversal that is rise from february low at 1 3068 has possibly completed at 1 3564 already but of course the outlook will very much depend on today s job data from both canada and us as for dollar further decline remains in favor in general some near term levels are needed to be taken out at least some of them to confirm a turn around in the greenback otherwise we won t be convinced by any knee jerk bullish reactions to nfp those levels include 1 1200 support in eur usd 0 6938 support in aud usd 1 0008 resistance in usd chf

and tariff issues appeared to have made some progress but the talks would continue on friday and probably into the weekend it s reported that the us is considering to delaying the 5 tariffs on all mexican imports which is due on monday june 10 but white house spokesperson sarah sanders reiterated trump is still moving forward with the tariffs after the meeting on thursday us vice president mike pence said mexico had offered more there has been some movement on their part it s been encouraging he said the discussions are going to continue in the days ahead mexican foreign minister marcelo ebrard said 6000 members of the national guard were sent to secure its southern border with guatemala fed williams shifts in demographics and productivity growth fundamentally altered the world after in a speech delivered yesterday new york fed president john williams said he viewed the pre 2008 crisis era as the world before and the period after that as the world after inflation was a major concerns in the pre 2008 era but now inflation that s too low is now a more pressing problem the experience of a slow recovery and persistently low inflation is a symptom of deeper problems afflicting advanced economies two changes have taken place in shifts in demographics and productivity growth that fundamentally altered the economic environment and that translate directly into slower trend economic growth also an abundance of savings and a decline in demand for savings resulting from slower trend growth together lead to lower interest rates combined they have contributed to dramatic declines in the longer term neutral rate of interest or r star on the economy he said my baseline is a very good one with gdp growth at above trend 2 25 to 2 50 though tailwinds from last year s tax cuts are fading headwinds from trade tensions are rising he added the yield curve inversion is a pretty strong signal of perception that rates are going to be lower but he didn t take that as an oracle imf raises us growth forecasts to 2 6 in 2019 agrees to fed pausing rate hikes imf managing director christine lagarde said economic forecasts for us for 2019 will be raised by 0 3 to 2 6 for 2020 growth is expected to slow to 1 9 imf is seeing a lot of positives in the macroeconomic outcomes and there is a lot for americans to be proud of meanwhile imf full agree with fed s approach in pausing its process of raising interest rates that will give policymakers time to gauge the balance of risks to both inflation and employment outcomes and to build a clearer picture of whether further adjustments in the federal funds rate are warranted on trade however lagarde emphasized it will be essential that the u s and its trading partners work constructively together to better address distortions in the trading system and it is especially important that the trade tensions between the u s and its trading partners including china and mexico are quickly resolved through a comprehensive agreement that results in a stronger and more integrated international trading system pboc yi tremendous room in fiscal and monetary policy to counter trade war people s bank of china governor yi gang said in a bloomberg interview that china has tremendous room for adjusting its fiscal and monetary policy to counter the impact of trade war with us and there is no red line in yuan s exchange rate we have plenty of room in interest rates we have plenty of room in required reserve ratio rate and also for the fiscal monetary policy toolkit i think the room for adjustment is tremendous yi said he also noted that china s fiscal policy this year is probably the largest and strongest fiscal reform package that include tax cuts and fiscal resources allocation if situation is getting a little bit worse the current fiscal package is able to cover but it situations gets tremendously worse they will open the discussion on yuan exchange rate yi said trade war would have a temporary depreciation pressure on renminbi however he insisted after the noise renminbi will continue to be very stable and relatively strong compared to emerging market currencies even compared to convertible currencies meanwhile yi also emphasized there is no red line in the exchange rate and no numeric number is more important than the others euro in familiar range after ecb triggered moves much volatility was seen in euro yesterday on ecb but it settled in familiar range after all the moves in short ecb said interest rates are going to stay at currently level for longer at least through the first half of 2020 the post meeting press conference was not too dovish at all it just rejected as president mario draghi described confidence in the present baseline but also clear acknowledgement of risks growth outlook for 2019 was revised up but slightly down for 2020 and 21 inflation outlook for 2019 was revised up down for 2020 more on ecb on the data front australia home

pivots s1 1 3337 p 1 3385 r1 1 3410 more usd cad s fall resumed after brief recovery and intraday bias is turned back to the downside current development suggests that choppy rise from 1 3068 has completed at 1 3564 on bearish divergence condition in daily macd sustained trading below 1 3357 support should confirm this bearish case and target 1 3274support next more importantly that could also have medium term channel support taken out which carries larger bearish implications too however break of 1 3430 resistance will revive near term bullishness and turn bias back to retest 1 3564 in the bigger picture usd cad is staying well inside medium term rising channel support at 1 3335 thus the up trend from 1 2061 2017 low could be in progress on the upside decisive break of 61 8 retracement of 1 4689 2016 high to 1 2061 at 1 3685 will pave the way to 78 6 retracement at 1 4127 next this will remain the favored case as long as 1 3068 support holds however sustained break of the channel support will be the first sign of medium term reversal firm break of 1 3068 would confirm economic indicators update
when presidents donald trump and xi jinping meet at the g 20 summit in june 2019 there are hopes that they will come to some agreement to end the trade war between china and the united states but such hopes have already been raised and dashed several times since the trade war began in 2018 yet observers still question how long the war could last the economies of the two countries are closely intertwined so much so that historian niall ferguson coined the term chimerica to describe them a long trade war would no doubt be costly for both that should have been enough of an incentive for the two sides to settle their differences before the conflict intensifies further so far that has not happened after an initial round of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs on 50 billion of goods on each side the united states imposed a 10 percent tariff on a list of chinese imports worth another 200 billion in september 2018 in response china levied duties of between 5 and 10 percent on a list of american imports worth 60 billion then after china backed away from pledges it had made during trade negotiations the united states boosted the tariff rate on its 200 billion list of chinese goods to 25 percent in may 2019 china followed suit raising the tariff rates on its 60 billion list of american goods to as high as 25 percent not to be outdone trump ordered his administration to ready new tariffs on the remaining 300 billion of goods the united states imports from china if those u s tariffs are implemented china can be expected to slap tariffs on the remaining 20 billion or so of goods that it imports from the united states much like actual wars trade wars can take on a life of their own at some point careful calculations of costs and benefits begin to matter less than they did at the outset a trade war can easily escalate to become an economic drag on both combatants for the moment neither china nor the united states seems overly concerned about that to understand why we should consider their respective perceptions of the trade war the chinese perspective for china the trade war with the united states did not come at the best time against a backdrop of global economic softness beijing is managing the transformation of its economy from one based on massive investment and export led manufacturing to one where domestic consumption plays a larger role no doubt the trade war has complicated matters even so chinese leaders have reasons to believe they are likely to prevail in a trade fight against the united states one former chinese vice minister even publicly boasted about them access to financial resources is among the greatest assets in beijing s trade war arsenal enabling it to cushion the impact of the conflict on its economy as chinese commentators often cite china s central bank the people s bank of china pboc holds about 3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves perhaps even more important is that china s national government debt currently stands at only 50 percent of gdp compare that to america s which tops 100 percent and japan s which is near 240 percent that means that beijing feels it has room to borrow and borrow it has shelving efforts to rein in the debts of china s local governments for the time being beijing is expected to allow them to issue new debt worth over 300 billion in 2019 a sum 13 percent higher than the year before the chinese government can also direct the pboc as it has in the past to boost financial liquidity the pboc can do so either directly with cash injections or indirectly by lowering china s bank reserve requirements the amount of money that chinese banks must keep on deposit at the pboc in fact the direct approach was needed in may 2019 after the government took over baoshang bank a troubled chinese lender the pboc injected 62 billion into china s financial markets and another 72 billion two weeks later to calm them over the prior year the pboc has also used the indirect method five times to spur lending and economic growth and should that not yield the desired results china has been known to set loan quotas to compel its banks to lend furthermore beijing has shown its willingness to intervene in markets in even more direct ways after china s stock market plunged in 2015 the government stepped in to prop up share prices it instructed the pboc to make cash available to government backed funds it then ordered those funds and even some brokerage firms to buy shares by early 2016 beijing went so far as to suppress trading in futures and derivatives by conducting what many fund managers complained were campaigns of intimidation against traders both foreign and domestic in several cases the chinese government launched criminal investigations into managers who sold shares short there is however one lever that beijing possesses but has been hesitant to use the devaluation of its currency the renminbi while doing so would give china s economy an immediate boost it would also ease the inflationary pressure that chinese tariffs have put on the u s economy worse still it would break china s informal currency peg to the u s dollar which has not traded above 7 yuan to the dollar for over a decade while there is nothing inherently special about that level breaking it would suggest that the economic conditions in china had worsened to a point where beijing could no longer defend the peg history offers a guide as to what could happen next within one month after china depreciated its currency by 2 percent in 2015 the pboc s foreign exchange reserves fell by nearly 94 billion by the end of that year over 320 billion was drained from its reserves hastened by concurrent expectations of a stronger u s economy that being said beijing could seek to impose higher economic costs on the united states to that end further increases in tariffs on american goods have limited utility that is because the value of china s imports from the united states is only one quarter of the value of china s exports to the u s indeed that is the crux of the trade war still beijing could make trouble for american companies by slowing down their customs clearances and permit approvals it could even prohibit them from operating in china altogether but beijing s first step would likely be to restrict chinese tourism to the united states which totals over 30 billion annually that was how china punished south korea after it failed to heed chinese objections to the deployment of the u s terminal high altitude area defense anti missile system on its soil in 2017 some have argued that the pboc could sell its 1 2 trillion of u s treasury securities which form a large part of its foreign exchange reserves that would depress the prices of those securities and push up their yields the resultant higher u s interest rates would hurt the american economy while such a strategy was a very real option a decade ago when capital readily flowed into china it is less realistic now in 2019 china is on track to run a current account deficit in other words capital is flowing out of china while one can debate whether china s current account deficit is structural or temporary the fact that it exists at all suggests that a sudden sale of u s treasury securities would be risky it could trigger a flight of capital from china as the difference in yields between chinese and u s government debt narrows meanwhile given near zero or negative interest rates in most major developed countries global appetite for yield may absorb even a massive sale of u s treasury securities without much difficulty blunting the most harmful effects of china s action others have raised the possibility that beijing could restrict the export of rare earth metals to the united states since china controls roughly 90 percent of the world s current production those metals are vital for many modern electronics from smartphones to guided missile systems certainly if beijing did so it would not be the first time in 2010 china introduced a quota system that cut its exports of rare earth metals by 40 percent that sent prices for the metals soaring for two years and prompted the united states to file a protest with the world trade organization wto in the meantime global supply and demand adjusted miners outside of china produced more rare earth metals and electronics manufacturers began using alternate metals by the time the wto ruled in favor of the united states and china lifted its export quota in 2014 the prices of most rare earth metals had already declined to just above their pre quota levels while some american companies were definitely hurt no catastrophe befell the vast majority of them finally chinese leaders might simply believe that they can outlast the united states only days after trump announced his latest round of tariffs on china he delayed imposing a portion of the tariffs related to auto parts after a u s department of commerce report revealed that the u s auto industry would need more time to adjust to the new tariffs that may suggest to china that more economic pressure on the united states could cause trump to blink but even if he does not trump s current term as president will end in early 2021 should he fail to be reelected xi could bargain with a new american president one who might be willing to strike a deal that is more favorable to china the american perspective for better or worse trump has not behaved like most american politicians he has shown that he is willing to sacrifice short term political capital if not u s corporate profits for longer term american economic competitiveness it also appears that he primed the u s economy for a trade fight during his first year as president he cut taxes supercharging a u s economy that had largely recovered from the 2008 financial crisis that has helped to produce record low unemployment and give the u s economy more room to absorb negative shocks although washington sometimes feels it has fewer economic levers than beijing as trump has expressed in his tweets the united states does have some natural assets in a trade war against china foremost among them is that china s economy is more reliant on the united states than the other way around american exports to china account for only 0 7 percent of u s gdp whereas chinese exports to the united states account for 4 5 percent of china s gdp while the long term economic costs of a trade war may be more evenly distributed the international monetary fund recently estimated that in the short term the trade war will trim a modest 0 3 to 0 6 percent from u s gdp growth but slice a heftier 0 5 to 1 5 percent from china s gdp growth the u s federal reserve america s central bank is another valuable asset in the trade war while american political leaders cannot directly steer its policy it is reasonably responsive to shifts in the trajectory of the u s economy should the federal reserve detect that the trade war is beginning to take a real economic toll it would likely lower short term u s interest rates to boost economic activity during the 2008 financial crisis the federal reserve also proved itself willing to take extreme monetary measures including a vast expansion of its balance sheet to help the u s economy if needed with such power the federal reserve could be a very potent instrument in the trade war but so far it has refused to play such a direct role of course the u s government is not without levers it can use to counter china some are fairly predictable in may the trump administration unveiled a plan to provide 16 billion in assistance to american farmers whose agricultural products will suffer from china s higher tariff rates but other levers have been extraordinary in the same month washington banned american companies from doing business with huawei technologies china s largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer that may have hobbled huawei without access to google s android applications huawei s products are far less competitive and now the u s government is reportedly considering other chinese firms to blacklist naturally beijing could retaliate in kind but it has fewer targets today than it once did that is because beijing already told chinese state owned firms to stop purchasing from major american companies like cisco ibm and oracle five years ago yet unlike beijing washington has little reason to believe that it can outlast china s current regime especially after xi enshrined his political philosophy into the chinese communist party s constitution in 2017 washington could however hope to outlast china s economic runway it is no secret that the chinese economy is cooling and that the enormous debts carried by china s local governments state owned enterprises and increasingly banks could rapidly chill it further for the moment confidence in china s 3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves to act as a backstop has helped to forestall a financial crunch but with enough pressure on the chinese economy and fuel for the u s economy washington could undermine those reserves and expose china to what could be a chain reaction of economic calamities which perspective is more right with so many intertwined trade war fighting strategies it is difficult to discern which perspective has the edge a simple scoreboard evaluating each strategy in isolation would not capture how they all interact together instead tracking markets which are good at synthesizing huge amounts of information may be the best way to tell which perspective is currently on top since china s equity market is still relatively shallow the best market to track may be the currency market particularly the trading in the yuan dollar currency pair even though china restricts trading of the pair to a predefined range china s currency can float within that range and how it floats can be telling if china s economic growth continues to decline relative to america s the yuan will naturally weaken against the dollar eventually it will breach the 7 yuan to the dollar level regardless of what china might do to prevent it but more important is how the yuan depreciates will it devalue in an orderly or disorderly fashion a rapid plunge would suggest a loss of confidence in china s ability to keep its economy chugging along that could presage bigger problems for china including perhaps a debt crisis or a massive capital outflow after all a devaluating currency does not attract capital in may when trade tensions between china and the united states flared the yuan lost over 2 5 percent of its value against the dollar in just over a week the long march with each side reasonably comfortable that it can outlast its opponent in the trade war neither has much motivation to give in at the moment hence it came as little surprise that china backtracked on the commitments it had made in earlier trade negotiations meanwhile the trump administration probably felt little pressure to rush into a deal especially if the deal fell far short of the administration s goal in contrast what has been surprising is how little criticism trump has received over the trade war from his seemingly implacable political opponents in the democratic party so far they have criticized only his tactics but not the war itself one of the democratic party s most senior politicians senator chuck schumer even voiced his encouragement for trump s action while that may seem remarkable one must remember that it has been the democratic party which has traditionally supported more protectionist policies indeed trump has had more trouble with members of his own republican party who have been long time free trade advocates so even if beijing finds itself dealing with a new american president after the next u s national election it may not find an entirely new approach especially if the trump administration s tariffs have made headway far from concluding the trade war between china and the united states might have only seen the end of its beginning in may xi told china that it was on a new long march referring to the famous four thousand mile journey chinese communists made to escape their enemies in the 1930s xi may have been signaling to audiences at home and abroad that the trade war could last a long time if true the united states would be wise to prepare for tariffs and economic disruptions to last a long time too all the same xi should make sure the new long march on which he has taken china does not turn out to be off a

via zerohedge after a period of unnatural stability in which the offshore yuan traded in a tight range of 6 90 and 6 95 since may 13 the yuan finally broke out of the channel and tumbled 0 5 the most in three weeks to at low as 6 9625 vs the dollar the lowest level since november 2018 after the chief of china s central bank said beijing has tremendous room to adjust monetary policy if the trade war with the u s deepens and hinted there s no line in the sand for the currency meaning the key psychological level of 7 does not exist in times of trade war the yuan had stabilized in recent weeks as authorities voiced support for the currency following a rout in early may that pushed it near 7 per dollar level not breached since the global financial crisis it still lost about 2 5 in may among the worst in asia we have plenty of room in interest rates we have plenty of room in required reserve ratio rate and also for the fiscal monetary policy toolkit i think the room for adjustment is tremendous pboc governor yi gang in an interview with bloomberg in beijing when asked if his upcoming meeting with steven mnuchin this weekend would get negotiations with the u s back on track yi said it would probably be a productive talk as always though the topic of the trade war would be uncertain and difficult the two are scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the g 20 meeting in japan this is the first publicly announced meeting since the trade talks fell apart last month and could pave the way for a meeting between presidents donald trump and xi jinping who will likely be in japan at the end of the month for the g 20 leaders summit commenting on the recent yuan move yi said that recently it s a little bit weaker because the tremendous pressure from the u s side when asked if there s a red line for the exchange rate yi said no number is more important than another that was all fx traders needed to hear to start selling the yuan this is a hint that china may allow the yuan to break 7 if the trade war escalates and yi is seeking to prepare and guide the market said gao qi a currency strategist at scotiabank in singapore it s possible that the yuan may breach that level if the trade talks collapse we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us not possible guaranteed even yi refused to outright deny that trade war could lead to devaluation the trade war would have a temporary depreciation pressure on renminbi but you see after the noise renminbi will continue to be very stable and relatively strong compared to emerging market currencies even compared to convertible currencies yi said using the yuan s official name i m very confident renminbi will continue to be stable at a more or less equilibrium level he then said that a little bit of flexibility of renminbi is good for the chinese economy and for the global economy because it provides an automatic stabilizer for the economy adding that the central bank of china is pretty much not intervening in the foreign exchange market for a long time and i hope that this situation will continue not intervening a growing number of economists predict that the worsening trade war and job market outlook could prompt the central bank to take bolder easing steps looking forward our base case is that an escalating trade war will push key gauges below the pboc s tolerance threshold triggering 50 basis points of rate cuts and another 150 200 bps of reserve requirement cuts by year end david qu an economist with bloomberg economics in hong kong wrote in a recent report that would most likely send the yuan below 7 00 for the first time in years and provoke a furious response from the white house in his bloomberg interview yi gave no indication that the government was considering more fiscal stimulus now to counteract the effect of the trade war our fiscal policy this year is probably the largest and strongest fiscal reform package in terms of the tax cuts and also in terms of having more efficient fiscal resources allocation between the central government and the local government yi said the current package is able to cover the cases where the situation is getting a little bit worse but of course if the situation gets tremendously worse they will open the discussion but right now they haven t discussed that scenario yet discussing the plunge in the yuan bloomberg s benjamin dow writes this morning that yi s failure to set a red line is rightly scaring money out of the cnh but it should come as no surprise 7 was already in view back in 1q before the market became overly optimistic about a u s china trade deal and little has changed since then he then explains china s strategy in terms of the russian response to western sanctions the calculus the pboc and other policymakers can employ is redolent of what the russian government did earlier this decade amid the oil crash and western sanctions let the ruble slide to help exports and also stretch forex reserves that come from dollar priced commodities and energy sales china s forex pile in the form of u s treasuries and other reserves play a similar role for beijing and that means a chance for weaker local currency in order to stretch that stimulus and so with china one step closer to allowing the yuan to slide below 7 one can be sure it won t go unnoticed by the white house bbg s richard jones writes and as much as the u s administration has been waging war by using tariffs don t be surprised if the white house starts trying to jawbone the usd lower too
the world is more levered today that it has ever been in the past and almost half of the increase in net debt over the past decade has come from emerging market economies with rising government debt fiscal policy has become increasingly constrained globally in some countries austerity has meant higher unemployment publicité many mainstream economists have even warned about the coming collapse of the world as we know it especially should the next recession hit and given the limited fiscal space no fiscal stimulus would be possible this time in the united states rising fiscal deficits and aggregate debt are viewed as a recipe for eventual disaster for the economy this is of course not a new debate for decades now we have been hearing about the same old story the us will go broke if it does not cut spending or raise taxes to fund its expenditure but the us still lives on at the same time central bank policies which have stabilized the financial system from complete collapse during the great financial crisis have been blamed for creating distortions and even contributing to rising wealth inequality many countries all around the world are facing a demographic problem and are wrestling with the challenges that come with the fourth industrial revolution a limited fiscal space in theory at least complicates matters in the case of mauritius the likes of the international monetary fund and our own economists have advised various governments to impose a target debt to gdp ratio and constrain fiscal spending there has also been a lot of criticism about the government becoming an ever larger employer of engaging in populist measures which it is argued can only lead to a more dangerous situation given a low tax regime and a 50 debt to gdp target fiscal policy in mauritius is highly constrained we may actually never get to the target given our near 70 debt to gdp imf adjustments but the mere fact of needing to show a fiscal deficit that is below 4 of gdp in the short term and 3 of gdp in the medium term does lead to constraints especially as grant money dries up in the coming years if the world economy continues to struggle or if there is a global recession then mauritius fiscal deficit will be even higher given lower growth it is clear that conventional thinking and policies have their limits various local dispensations in fact have made use or have wanted to make use of grants from abroad to finance capital expenditure given the reluctance to increase taxes the private sector in turn suffers from low corporate savings and is not very free cash flow generative and if one adjusts for investments within the real estate sector there is not much in terms of productive private investment occurring in mauritius the labour force has important skills mismatches and is underemployed in the coming decade the ageing of the population will not only put pressure on the savings rate but on labour input growth as well few may have noticed it but the current level of inflation in mauritius is very low with both year on year and core inflation rates being increasingly indicative of not only external factors but of an economy that is growing below its mid 4 potential if we put a mainstream economist hat on there is not much the government can do about it the purpose of this article then is twofold firstly it is to explain that while private debt is debt locally denominated government debt is actually private savings and that a limited use of modern monetary theory mmt when tailored can actually allow mauritius to grow at its potential without higher inflationary costs sameer sharma is a chartered alternative investment analyst and a certified financial risk manager source conjoncture may june 2019 by sameer sharma 1st part

noted the numbers may not be quite as strong as the headline reading suggests he noted that the unemployment rate fell in part because of a lower participation rate as well full time work accounted for all of the gains in hiring but the jobs were all focused in self employment with paid employment falling in may it s always difficult to forecast the lfs employment print and the risk was to the

as interest rates fall towards zero some economists say there is a growing likelihood that the reserve bank will resort to unconventional methods unconventional monetary policy governments in the united states japan and europe were forced to find new ways to stimulate their economies in devastating aftermath of the global financial crisis once interest rates had been slashed to around zero central banks began to purchase bonds from the private sector in a bid to pump cash into the economy the effect was to lower the yield on bonds which sent people into other assets particularly shares as a result this strategy called quantitative easing qe had the effect of boosting stock markets it also aimed to lower longer term interest rates with the purpose of encouraging borrowing by businesses and home buyers amp s chief economist shane oliver who describes qe as using printed money to buy bonds to inject cash into the economy says it appears to have been more effective in america than in europe and japan because it moved quickly to implement the strategy once conventional interest rate policy had reached its lower bound in a speech following tuesday s rate cut reserve bank governor philip lowe said he did not expect interest rates would have to be cut to their lower bound in australia when questioned on what that lower bound might be lowe referred to the recent global experience loading if you look at what happened in the uk the us and canada rates got to 0 25 0 5 per cent there so i think for many economies that s judged to be the effective lower bound he said i m not anticipating we get to those levels top economic officials in australia have frowned on qe in the past in 2016 john fraser then secretary of the commonwealth treasury said a range of different experimental interventions have been tried with mixed results even so economists in academic and business believe quantitative easing is now a possibility in australia as the cash rate falls we are likely to see an increasing debate around whether the rba will use quantitative easing says oliver who was among the first to forecast a reserve bank rate cut in 2019 royal bank of canada economist su lin ong says the rba would much prefer to use their traditional interest rate ammunition but any future deterioration in the global economy will make unconventional monetary policy more likely in australia we know that they are prepared but it s a question of how they do it she said it will look different here to other parts of the world the reserve bank has kept a close eye on the various experiments with unconventional monetary policy since the gfc in december the reserve s deputy governor guy debelle said we have also been able to examine the experience of others with other tools of monetary policy and have learned from that hopefully we won t ever have to put that learning into practice qe is a policy option in australia should it be required other unconventional policies are also possible oliver says it is debatable as to whether qe has been the best approach globally he thinks a more efficient and fairer option may be for the rba to work with the federal government to provide what economists call helicopter money a direct payment to households so they spend and revive growth the rudd government used this strategy with a 900 cash bonus to households to boost spending during the gfc but unconventional monetary policy by the rba is not the only option to lift the australian economy from its torpor with interest rate policy reaching its limits in australia pressure will mount for the government to use fiscal policy to boost growth budget policy and economic reforms since the sweeping reforms of the 1980s including the floating of the dollar and deregulation of financial and labour markets the reserve bank s management of interest rates has been the main tool of economic management but in tuesday s speech lowe warned that there were downsides to relying too much on interest rates there are limitations on what realistically can be achieved he said so as a country we should also be looking at other options to reduce unemployment he offered two alternatives first more government spending on things that boost productivity especially needed infrastructure this spending not only adds to demand in the economy but it also adds to the economy s productive capacity he said rba governor philip lowe credit peter braig second is what lowe called structural policies that support firms expanding investing innovating and employing people the government s income tax plans announced in april s budget is one example but lowe probably had in mind more ambitious pro growth reforms the kind that have become rare in australia both alternatives mooted by lowe are politically challenging for the morrison government loading lowe s call means less emphasis on budget repair and more spending on things such as infrastructure that puts the government s much vaunted 2019 20 budget surplus in jeopardy and would delay plans to reduce commonwealth debt both of those commitments were central to the coalition s election pitch also the morrison government s small target election campaign strategy means it has no mandate for the kind of sweeping productivity boosting structural policies to which lowe referred but there are signs the government will be open to a more expansive policy agenda
rashid abdi for addis standard addis abeba may 10 2019 two mass protest movements have in quick succession forced regime changes in sudan and ethiopia two of the horn of africa s quintessential hard states a deep seated disillusion with the security and developmental states drives the new revolutionary mood what is less clear is where all the ferment and the popular demand for a new dispensation will lead in sudan the ouster of al bashir has been followed by a partial retreat of the security state in ethiopia the election of a reformist pm and a year of sweeping reforms have extensively eroded the power of the security deep state yet neither pm abiy s extensive cull nor sudanese military council s modest targeted purge constitute a fundamental dismantling of the structures of the security state more important the transitions under way in the two countries were in the initial phases at least top down attempts by the security state to engineer a soft landing with minimal disruptions pm abiy s singular act of genius lay in the way he deftly subverted that strategy of piecemeal reform assigned to him by the ruling party and began almost single handedly to unravel old ethiopia at break neck speed the retreat of the authoritarian order in both cases opens huge possibilities a generational opportunity for meaningful and positive change but also great risks in ethiopia a year of deep reforms under the reformist premier abiy ahmed has put the transition on a rocky but relatively steady positive trajectory overall prospects for good governance civil liberties and human rights continue to improve in sudan the situation is less hopeful and remains so far uncertain the hopes and expectations raised by the resignation of omar al bashir after 30 years in power now grates against the reality of a potentially messy and protracted transition following a controversial intervention by the army the transition military council tmc made up of bashir s allies is struggling against mounting popular discontent to manage an interregnum the horn is at strategic crossroads there is immense hope but also great fear how ethiopia and sudan manage their fraught transitions and the prospects for success and reversal remain unknown what is not in doubt is that a botched transition in both nations will crush the dream of millions and their quest for liberty and better quality of life embolden autocratic regimes and vindicate their ideology of stability the unprecedented upheaval and ferment in the two horn states provide an extraordinary window into the complex diverse and obscure changes and currents shaking up society and traditional politics these contextual dynamics must not be overlooked in the analyses of ethiopia and sudan sudan s turbulent interregnum sudan and ethiopia offer two fraught transition models atypical unstable and potentially reversible while dissimilar in some key aspects both are attempts at a top down fix reliant on continued goodwill and support of the military security services and dominant parties more important the two transitions are not outcomes of a political and constitutional settlements and likely to remain contested and unsettled for some time sudan s transition is in its infancy and dogged by a host of challenges of the two it is the one with the greatest potential for short term crisis but if successful one that opens enormous possibilities for improved governance and stability formal direct talks between sudan s protest movement and the military began on 27 april but quickly hit a snag barely two days later the key sticking points the length of the transition military wants 2 years the protest movement favours 4 years arguing more time was needed to undo the damage of 30 years of misrule composition of the proposed sovereign transition council stc and who should lead it on 30 april the tmc issued a series of controversial and unilateral decisions that escalated the stalemate into a crisis the council said the stc would be headed by the military 7 out 10 posts allocated to the military contrary to spa s demand for a 15 member council the bulk of whose members are civilian it further called on the spa to dismantle barricades at the army command in khartoum and get protesters off the streets the generals have been angling for a longer pre transition period from the start this was largely based on the assumption they stood to gain more from the tactical point of view the spa had more to lose but there are other pressing calculations first more time allows the tmc to sort out internal divisions second it gives them the leg room to craft and fine tune its negotiation strategy third it provides the tmc with the opportunity to drag out the process wear down the pro democracy movement the so called attrition option that has served the military well in the past the decision by the au to extend the tmc s life by three months is therefore a major victory for the military it now has up to the end of july 2019 to set up an authority to oversee the transition agree a roadmap with the opposition a viable transition roadmap in sudan depends on consensus between the five distinct actors constituencies the street the leadership of the protest movement traditional parties the tmc and support from regional actors this will not be easy it is almost certain divergent aims interests and calculations could prove a major impediment military council a reluctant reformer at the heart of sudan s chaotic and bitter transition contest indeed the crisis of legitimacy credibility is the self appointed tmc it is made up of senior generals all beneficiaries of the army purges in the last one decade by bashir that elevated loyalists to key posts they eased bashir out made a number of significant concessions but controversially stone walled when it came to the speedy transfer of power to a civilian administration significantly it has so far resisted popular calls for the dismantling of the so called deep state dawlah al amiqah widely perceived as a covert power centre whose members included senior generals securocrats and politicians and which exercised extra constitutional influence on the state what the tmc s true aims are its interests and links with the deep state and foreign powers are all a matter for debate and conjecture far less speculative and hazardous perhaps is what it isn t the council is essentially a product of a deep crisis within the state a hastily created crisis response tool to reassert military influence and manage a fluid political situation it pulled back from imposing state of emergency allowed protests to continue quickly shed unpopular senior ex regime figures such as intelligence chief salah gosh released some not all political prisoners and reached out to protest leaders all positive and encouraging steps that demonstrate it has significant agency is pragmatic and amenable to a political settlement yet the clumsy nature of the coup the confusion in the first 48 hours as well as incoherent pronouncements and policy flip flops since then point to deep internal frictions tactically this could be an advantage for the coalition leading the protests potentially giving them greater room to nudge the tmc towards reform and influence the agenda it could also pose serious challenges in the coming weeks and months especially if as some fear the council becomes opportunistic and capricious and its cohesions becomes more frayed but there must be no mistake about the tmc s politics its primary goal is to maintain national stability it views retention of military power influence and privilege as necessary to achieve that noble goal there is no evidence it shares the democratic aspirations of the majority of the sudanese people it is instinctively suspicious of civilians and resistant to the idea of civilian oversight and even much less civilian rule sudan s military for three decades waged not just war but also engaged in multiple peace processes and political negotiations at local and national levels involving armed and non armed civilian opponents under bashir talks were conducted in the same manner as war was waged invariably three distinct tactics with roots in war strategy were deployed to outflank and eviscerate the civilian opposition accommodation co option and containment the official discourse and rhetoric surrounding the series of national dialogues in train for nearly two decades offers a fascinating glimpse into the appropriation of martial metaphors a progressive militarization of politics domestic politics was officially referred to as jabhat al daakhiliyah internal front political parties were reminded of the value of national cohesion and called upon to help unify the ranks tawhid al saf dissidents were cat s paw mikhlab qit of foreign enemies sudan s protest movement will be negotiating with a military that has set ways of dealing with civilian adversaries expectations it is willing to make a strategic and irreversible retreat from politics seems over optimistic the tmc s 30th april pronouncements and the subsequent hardening of language certainly sow doubt about the prospect of that happening any time soon the unilateral and escalatory nature of the council s statement goes against the letter and spirit of the negotiations it may be a hint of an intense internal power struggle it could also signal an attempt by hardline factions to assert greater control a hypothesis lent some credence by the fact it was the tmc s second in command gen muhammad hamdan dagalo aka hemedti who was personally involved hemedti the commander of the rapid support forces rsf quwaat al da m al sari has in recent weeks emerged as the real power within the tmc playing court to visiting dignitaries and diplomats his swift maneuvers to consolidate power within the military and security services is anything but coincidental he was for example elevated to a member of the national intelligence and security service official suna news agency dispatch said he was now uzw a member of niss a vague term that is both odd and inexplicable at a low key event in khartoum in late april the rsf itself is affiliated to the niss since it was established in 2013 from the rump of the janjaweed militia and one would assume hemedti as commander would be a member of the intelligence and security service the original force roughly 7 000 was drawn mainly from hemedti s own rizaygat tribe in darfur an important factor in itself that partly explains its strong internal cohesion and loyalty to hemedti it has a complicated dual command chain answerable to both the niss dg and the regular army general command bashir increasingly relied on the rsf and the popular police forces in recent years to quell social unrest and low level armed insurrections the bulk of the rsf is now fighting in yemen alongside emirati troops a decision based on rsf s perceived counterinsurgency competence adaptability to the yemeni battlefield conditions hemedti is young ambitious and has powerful gulf friends keen to see him play an influential role in the transition he has a fearsome reputation deemed both an able battle field commander and skillful political operator his rise to prominence since bashir s ouster and high visibility within the tmc suggest a resurgence of hardline elements keen not to cede too much ground to the protest movement old parties protest movement sudan s bewildering array of political parties weakened and deeply fragmented and caught off guard by the protests seem keen to be included in the transition talks the tmc initially seemed to prefer a broad based dialogue in part because that could have neutralized the weight of the protest movement it has since walked back and proposed a format that significantly shortened list of participants not least because of the risks of an unwieldy and fractious dialogue process impossible to conclude within the short time frame it now has three months sudan s protest movement and its leadership hold the initiative in the contest to shape the transition the call for freedom justice and peace emblazoned on every placard gelled a fragmented nation and triggered the horn s most powerful and unprecedented mass protest movements the expectations are high and the road to achieving them daunting the risk of fragmentation within the protest movement is high it is now made up of two distinct groups quwaa i laan al huriyyat wal tagyiir declaration of freedom and change forces and the sudanese professionals association tajamm u al mihniyiin al sudaniyin they are now broadly aligned in their demands tmc co option strategies and the attrition of protracted negotiation highly likely to sow division the spa and the dfcf have so far done a remarkable job in leading a cohesive disciplined and non violent mass protest movement they must not sell themselves short in the delicate negotiations now under way they must safeguard their cohesion eschew personal ambition remain vigilant against the familiar co option traps stay resilient and focused in the face of setbacks and hard nosed at every phase of the negotiations ethiopia s rocky transition ethiopia s transition is the outcome of two severe crises that shook the regime to the core over four years of relentless mass protests in oromiya and amhara regional states and a sharp economic downturn the eprd the coalition of four ethno regional parties that dominated politics since the early 90s played a central role in the transition engineered abiy ahmed s rise it started off well in the early years combining a reformist zeal with an accommodative approach to politics its fortunes for over two decades was tied to that of the charismatic and talented meles zenawi its owes its structural and organizational resilience more importantly its internal consensus style ethos to him the aftermath of the controversial elections in 2005 and massive crackdowns on protests ushered in a long period of repression deflected the party from its democratic goals and progressively strengthened the hegemony of the tplf but even in its weakened state the eprd proved its dependability as an instrument of crisis management at critical junctures it engineered a smooth transition of power after the death of meles in august 2012 leaned on hailemariam to resign as pm in february 2018 abiy capitalized on the party s internal institutional strength exploited the antipathy to the tplf to build the tactical alliances necessary to seal his victory at the eprdf congress in february 2018 ironically abiy s radical reforms in particular the planned swift transition to a conventional multi party system makes the future of the governing coalition perilous and uncertain while the pm has orchestrated changes within the eprdf and consolidated his grip over his own oromo democratic party odp many suspect the era of the dominant vanguard party may be coming to a close significantly the pm has relied on a close knit circle of politicians and inexperienced advisers to drive his fast paced reforms with minimal or no input from the eprd and other key institutions the benefits of a personalized elite driven reform seem obvious abiy arguably needed the latitude and flexibility it provides to push through a raft of deep reforms and swiftly dismantle key pillars of tplf power in the military security services and economy the potential drawbacks of a highly personalized leadership style and an elite driven reform process lacking sufficient institutional buy in and support must be obvious it is inherently risky alienates the very agencies indispensable to implementation and long term sustainability understood thus the risks to reform in ethiopia seem not so much bureaucratic inertia as bureaucratic recalcitrance rumblings of unease within the state and in the parastatals over key aspects of the reforms from privatization to the future of the ethnic federalism system reinforce these fears the pm rhetorically at least is increasingly aware of this potential problem stepped up meetings with key departments and pledged to deepen institutional engagement however his critics charge the impromptu townhall style meetings are cosmetic and do not constitute structured policy dialogue ethnic unrest identity politics may act as a catalyst for change but it s huge capacity to complicate transitions foment new unrest must not be ignored ethiopia is an egregious example aggressive and adversarial strains of ethno nationalisms resurgent in recent years pose grave conflict risks many ethnic conflicts are traditionally driven by contested borders and resource competition ethno regionalism nationalism aggravate these conflicts and make them intractable pm abiy s stabilization and consolidation efforts have had minimal impact in de escalating the problem balancing multiple and contending ethnic interests proved far trickier than anticipated his policy of accommodation to remedy historical injustices allocate more government posts to marginalized communities and disadvantaged segments of the population won wider praise but either failed to mollify more militant and younger ethno nationalist activists clamoring for deeper affirmative action or reinforced resentment among other ethnicities this is particularly the case in oromiya where factions loyal to the oromo liberation front that view the pm as a traitor to the oromo cause continue to stoke violence undermine social cohesion several attempts to mediate an end to the ructions in oromiya and reconcile the rival factions so far have produced shaky truces that failed to hold meanwhile the pm s anti corruption drive and political consolidation strategy perceived targeted at curbing the influence exerted by the minority tigrayan ethnic community on the country s political and economic life fomented serious backlash widely held perception the premier s new friendship with eritrean president isaias afwerki is partly motivated by a common desire to isolate the tplf served to further inflame sentiments in tigray the region is now effectively a mini state its relations with addis abeba deeply fraught and antagonistic on off dialogue between addis and mekele and series of high level meetings in 2018 failed to smooth relations or diminish the potentially dangerous siege mentality developing in tigray the region is where the country s elite military units are garrisoned and sophisticated heavy military hardware including air combat assets kept a legacy of the border conflict with eritrea an armed conflict highly improbable but impossible to rule out would be catastrophic economic hardship economic hardships remain core drivers of social unrest in sudan and ethiopia conditions for the vast majority of their populations progressively worsened in the last five years sudan s loss of oil revenues in 2012 and subsequent deadlock over oil transshipment fees with south sudan triggered the country s severest economic crisis in decades high inflation currency turbulence and a series of austerity measures that saw subsidies lifted on bread and other commodities hit the lower classes hard and fomented the mass protests that quickly engulfed the whole country in ethiopia the crisis was largely induced by the frenetic pace of growth skewed development expensive infrastructure mega projects and dependence on foreign loans chinese abiy in early 2018 inherited a state that was virtually bankrupt its foreign exchange reserve depleted and saddled with mounting and unsustainable debt servicing obligations an emergency deposit of 1 billion dollars into the treasury by the uae helped to stabilize the volatile fiscal situation the short to medium term prospects look bleak even though china s decision to write off some of the debt in late april figures and signals of support from multilateral financial institutions donors promise some relief in sudan the uae similarly stepped in to shore up the currency by depositing 500m in the treasury in april 2019 donors have equally signaled readiness to help the gravity of the economic crisis in the two states and the improbability of a quick and dramatic improvement portend huge risks for the transition yet the kind of tangible and irreversible progress in their delicate transitions necessary to unlock donor support and foreign investment hardly exists now and bound to take years by which time conditions would have deteriorated further in ethiopia the continued proliferation of ethnic unrest and violence in economically productive regions that has triggered massive displacement estimated at 3 million government inability to get on top of the situation is hugely destabilizing in itself but also certain to prove a major impediment to new foreign investment an emergency financial aid package for sudan and long term economic relief and stimulus package for ethiopia seem the best options for the international community to shore up the transitions a youth revolt the uprisings in ethiopia and sudan constitute the horn s first uniquely large scale youth revolt the first political coming of age of two youth generations embittered by economic hardship and the inequities of the hard state ethiopia with over 70 of the population out of a total of 110 million under 30 and sudan with 60 of the population 42 5 million under the age of 25 are examples of states where the demographic shift has been at its most starkest reflecting both the promise and destabilizing potential of the so called youth bulge two distinct but complimentary historical trends converged in the horn protests a massive demographic shift that progressively moved the youth to the centre of politics a technological revolution that provided them with the tools to effectively resist and organize the sheer demographic weight the volatility and restless energy unleashed by these changes cannot be ignored the long term viability and sustainability of the transitions hinges on how the disruptive impact of the youth bulge is managed the recurrent themes of the protests are familiar revolve around a set of socio economic grievances that cut across the age divide jobs and better wages economic growth opportunities and autonomy better services sudan s unemployment rate estimated around 21 4 or over two million of the productive labor force 21 million social media diaspora the protest movements in ethiopia and sudan are beneficiaries of the digital revolution effectively harnessing the power of the smartphone and social media facebook twitter whatsapp to challenge the regimes in power these tools allowed them to organize break state s monopoly over information generate their own multimedia content in the contest for narrative space the state was severely disadvantaged its power of monopoly over communication and access to sophisticated cyber spying software was offset by the technical savvy and ingenuity of the protesters frequent communication shutdowns that targeted sms internet access proved ineffective protesters used vpns encrypted messaging apps and relied on diaspora supporters to bypass state censorship diaspora support in both instances was crucial and went beyond amplifying social media messages activists in north america and europe mobilized funds organized pickets and petitions highlighted rights abuses raised the profile of these protests at the international stage the oromo diaspora in the us close knit and with its own influential media outlets played a particularly pivotal role a role recognized by pm abiy himself when he made a thanksgiving tour of the us in 2018 a number of high profile exiled figures have since been given high level posts in the ethiopian government diaspora influence and power has not been without controversy especially in ethiopia there have been claims hardline activists and media disseminated fake news and inflammatory messages to stoke ethnic hostility and division in sudan there is speculation probably fueled by the military the diaspora is inciting intransigence and radicalizing the protest movement the transition in ethiopia has brought to the fore the simmering tensions between political classes inside the country and those abroad growing intra oromo divisions partly reflect both the type of rivalries political divergence and clash of ambitions that could complicate the transition a fracturing of the protest movement s core support base remains a potential risks inherent in a delicate transition such as ethiopia s but also that in sudan the sudanese reform movement has so far stayed remarkably cohesive that unity is almost certain to come under great strain especially in the highly likely scenario of protracted and intensely contested transition the transition military council favors a fragmented and weak opposition all the signs indicate that is an outcome it is actively working to achieve identity politics sudan and ethiopia are similar in a variety of ways they are the horn s most diverse states with a combined total of 99 major ethnic groups and over 200 languages and dialects they still remain geographically vast and unwieldy even after secessionist wars and peace settlements led to a partition that diminished their original size both share a long history of multiple armed conflicts vast ill governed and severely underdeveloped peripheries conditions that incubated volatile forms of identity politics insurrections and social unrest both also experimented with decentralization models designed to foster self rule greater autonomy neither ethiopia s radical ethnic federal system nor sudan s conventional one achieved the desired aims instead they replicated the ills of the central state bred their own inequities inflamed ethno regional nationalisms and reinforced core periphery tensions ethnic identity politics was a potent factor in the ethiopian mass protests providing the glue and energy what is fascinating is not just the complex ways in which group grievances intersect feed off bleed into wider discontent but the subtle somewhat counter intuitive ways in which even hitherto antagonistic ethnicities regions and religious groups managed to cooperate and transcend their differences ethiopia s mass protests never evolved into a single nationwide movement like sudan s they were almost exclusively confined to oromiya and amhara regional states dominated by two ethnicities divided by a long history of mutual antipathy yet activists in the two regions drew energy succor from each other s protests cross fertilized and learnt effective protest tactics from one another for example amhara region s ghost town tactics that paralyzed cities were replicated in oromiya gradually a new sense of mutual empathy and solidarity developed between oromo and amhara protesters the seminal moment was when protesters in the two regions chanted down down woyane proof the two distinct ethnic discontents had coalesced into a single national demand what tipped the scale was not critical mass though that was important but the emergence of a proto narrative that encapsulated shared national goals in sudan the protest leadership quickly tapped into and harnessed the vast array of diverse grievances to weave a set of key national objectives with a comparably freer civic space well organized trade union movement and professional associations with a proud tradition of political activism sudan s mass revolt took on a national character much more quickly than in ethiopia the rallies in khartoum reflected the diversity of the nation s social fabric and remained characterized throughout by a convivial ecumenical spirit as remarkable as it is rare identity protest and culture sudan achieved in protest what eluded it for decades a genuine moment of unity in diversity the protest rallies in khartoum were a microcosm of the nation bringing together diverse ethnicities civic groups drawn from all regions social strata and professions darfuris kordofanis and nubians women and other distinct social groups aggrieved workers and traders all disenfranchised rendered powerless and invisible by state policies were catapulted onto the national stage they all made common cause and rallied around a single political message but the mass uprisings in sudan and ethiopia were more not just animated by political and economic grievances activists in sudan actually took slight at media characterization of their protests as bread riots they were also impelled by cultural discontent a sense of humiliation and anger at the state s perceived cultural homogenization discrimination and misogyny in ethiopia the oromo unrest was fueled in part by long simmering grievances over status of the oromo language and state interferences in religious affairs while in sudan state driven islamization and arabization remained major sources of social frictions the act of protest was in itself psychologically culturally transformative providing for opportunity to assert cultural pride and reclaim self confidence and autonomy the oromo pride movement in ethiopia and the rise of women in sudan exemplify the cultural forces shaping the politics of protests and transitions pm abiy s open embrace appropriation of oromo culture and his gender parity campaign are just two examples of the symbolic and practical policy impacts hopes are high sudan s new breed of assertive female activists could capitalize on the national mood for change harness their collective picketing power to influence the transition s agenda no less important the rallies served as vehicle for collective catharsis and radical empathy a space to affirm values of mutual interdependence solidarity and peaceful co existence the slogan kuluna darfur we are all darfur at the rallies in khartoum hopefully was not just a feel good empathetic response but marks a fundamental positive shift in the way communities relate to one another religion culture religion as a powerful galvanizer conduit for protest and repository of moral ethical values necessary for a just society and government has a long history in the horn the protests in sudan and ethiopia provide contrasting lessons in the resilience of religion its potency to inspire and channel protest but far more interesting how the debate over relevance of religion in governance continues to evolve the oromo mass insurrection in ethiopia gestated for many years fed off diverse small and localized communal grievances before it snowballed into a national crisis the big triggers high youth unemployment state driven land grabs punitive taxation repression and violent crackdowns are well known less remarked and examined are the obscure and overlapping cultural and religious roots of the discontent brewing for close to a decade the political rebellion owed much of its resilience and success to the cultural revivalist movement gaining in momentum and influence in recent years it drew energy inspiration and self confidence from the potent message of ethnic pride preached by oromo elders abba gadda oromo traditional waqqeffana religion practiced by a small fraction of the community roughly less than 5 played an important complimentary role as a central pillar of cultural expression regarded as the indigenous faith of the oromo nation its rituals and spiritual teachings deemed ecumenical and non threatening to believers of other faiths it progressively galvanized millions the irrecha annual festival of harvests with roots in the waqqeffana religion drew tens of thousands became a visible symbol of political and cultural consciousness a focal point for the protests series of muslim unrests in oromiya in 2012 quickly spread to other regions and continued to simmer for over 18 months much of it initially triggered by alleged state interference in muslim affairs but quickly aggravated by mass arrests of clerics and community leaders suspension of muslim publications such as ye muslimoch guday the muslim protests viewed across oromiya as evidence of the state s wider malign intent against the oromo thus triggered the first spark that lit the fire of large scale rebellion in 2014 oromo nation s ability to harness its cultural heritage and multiple faith traditions and foster internal mutual respect and tolerance is unique so too the tradition of syncretism which indigenized islam and christianity and reduced the heat and social frictions generally associated with puritanism and proselytism this cultural adaptability and inherent resistance to exclusivist manifestations of faith may partly explain why salafism found oromiya a less ambient and sympathetic territory to put down roots the bid to project this benign and positive face of oromo culture on the national stage was thwarted by fragmentation and factionalism as well as the political clout exerted by militant factions widely perceived wedded to exclusivist ethnic agenda pm abiy a practicing pentecostal with muslim heritage represents this hybrid pluralistic and healthy attitude to religion while his fervent faith and the occasional unnerving messianic tenor to his speeches raised some concerns the pm so far has acted with great sensitivity on faith matters he released detained muslim leaders appointed record numbers to key state posts reached out to the orthodox church abiy s medemer philosophy based on values of love compassion and solidarity in the new testament does not signal intent to christianize or change the strong secular character of the state the primary motive is to create a unifying principle around which the nation can rally the rise of evangelical churches and their aggressive proselytization remains a source of anxiety within the influential orthodox church but the greatest threat to religious harmony stems from ethnic conflict inter communal violence in troubled pockets of the country in the last one year exacerbated religious tensions and triggered attacks on mosques and churches sudan islam in transition a striking feature of sudan s protest movement is the near total absence of islamist slogans and the emergence of a more assertive youthful female activists keen to raise their visibility subvert the strict dress code and claw back the huquq al mar a al maqsub usurped fundamental rights of women the language and tone of discourse is deliberately non confessional these two complimentary dynamics lend a mildly secular character to the uprising for the first time in three decades islam is no longer a contentious subject for its young but we ought to be careful in not drawing hasty conclusions more important we must avoid the binary secular religious mindset prism in analyzing events in sudan that the battle over sudan s future is being waged over traditional secular issues liberty justice and bread and butter issues is emblematic not so much of a society that is becoming secular but one deeply disillusioned with the brand of islamization advocated by hassan al turabi and enforced by bashir for three decades sudan s young are rejecting the politicized islam that underpinned bashir s quasi islamic state and the stifling social conservatism fostered by its intrusive policies put differently what we are seeing in sudan is the early sign of a society that is self correcting seeking both to restore health to islam and return it to its traditional orbit sphere it is not yet clear who the secularists are in sudan s transition no group has so far articulated what one might call a clear secular agenda it is conceivable some in the protest movement traditional left leaning parties that played a big role in the protests and even elements in the tmc opposed to islamism may make common cause and lock out islamists from the transition whether all these diverse anti islamist stakeholders can agree on a common strategy to address the issue of islam and state is hard to tell an aggressive enclavement strategy that criminalizes islamism locks islamists out is certain to prove hugely destabilizing it risks driving islamists underground and bound to incubate the same toxic type of militancy and violence familiar in many parts of the muslim world sudan s best hope to achieve a viable and sustainable transition lays in a policy of accommodation that is genuinely inclusive islamist parties are predominantly moderate and including them in the tent has potential to lock them into the broader reform process temper their politics and progressively isolate the more militant groups gulf meddling the controversial intervention in sudan s transition in recent weeks by gulf actors principally uae and ksa ostensibly aimed at preventing the muslim brotherhood from staging a comeback is both ill advised and dangerous first there isn t the kind of cohesive highly organized islamist opposition able to single handedly gain dominance second the tmc cannot be a guarantor of long term stability nor can it serve as an effective bulwark against islamism third and assuming they cared to look deeper at the uprising and the social political trends they would have realized the depth of disillusionment with islamist politics and generally with all traditional politics and parties finally the saudi emirati axis s meddling alienates huge segments of society and counter productive to their twin strategic goals maintaining sudanese troops in yemen and isolating the muslim brotherhood editor s note rashid abdi is an

as interest rates fall towards zero some economists say there is a growing likelihood that the reserve bank will resort to unconventional methods unconventional monetary policy governments in the united states japan and europe were forced to find new ways to stimulate their economies in devastating aftermath of the global financial crisis once interest rates had been slashed to around zero central banks began to purchase bonds from the private sector in a bid to pump cash into the economy the effect was to lower the yield on bonds which sent people into other assets particularly shares as a result this strategy called quantitative easing qe had the effect of boosting stock markets it also aimed to lower longer term interest rates with the purpose of encouraging borrowing by businesses and home buyers amp s chief economist shane oliver who describes qe as using printed money to buy bonds to inject cash into the economy says it appears to have been more effective in america than in europe and japan because it moved quickly to implement the strategy once conventional interest rate policy had reached its lower bound in a speech following tuesday s rate cut reserve bank governor philip lowe said he did not expect interest rates would have to be cut to their lower bound in australia when questioned on what that lower bound might be lowe referred to the recent global experience loading if you look at what happened in the uk the us and canada rates got to 0 25 0 5 per cent there so i think for many economies that s judged to be the effective lower bound he said i m not anticipating we get to those levels top economic officials in australia have frowned on qe in the past in 2016 john fraser then secretary of the commonwealth treasury said a range of different experimental interventions have been tried with mixed results even so economists in academic and business believe quantitative easing is now a possibility in australia as the cash rate falls we are likely to see an increasing debate around whether the rba will use quantitative easing says oliver who was among the first to forecast a reserve bank rate cut in 2019 royal bank of canada economist su lin ong says the rba would much prefer to use their traditional interest rate ammunition but any future deterioration in the global economy will make unconventional monetary policy more likely in australia we know that they are prepared but it s a question of how they do it she said it will look different here to other parts of the world the reserve bank has kept a close eye on the various experiments with unconventional monetary policy since the gfc in december the reserve s deputy governor guy debelle said we have also been able to examine the experience of others with other tools of monetary policy and have learned from that hopefully we won t ever have to put that learning into practice qe is a policy option in australia should it be required other unconventional policies are also possible oliver says it is debatable as to whether qe has been the best approach globally he thinks a more efficient and fairer option may be for the rba to work with the federal government to provide what economists call helicopter money a direct payment to households so they spend and revive growth the rudd government used this strategy with a 900 cash bonus to households to boost spending during the gfc but unconventional monetary policy by the rba is not the only option to lift the australian economy from its torpor with interest rate policy reaching its limits in australia pressure will mount for the government to use fiscal policy to boost growth budget policy and economic reforms since the sweeping reforms of the 1980s including the floating of the dollar and deregulation of financial and labour markets the reserve bank s management of interest rates has been the main tool of economic management but in tuesday s speech lowe warned that there were downsides to relying too much on interest rates there are limitations on what realistically can be achieved he said so as a country we should also be looking at other options to reduce unemployment he offered two alternatives first more government spending on things that boost productivity especially needed infrastructure this spending not only adds to demand in the economy but it also adds to the economy s productive capacity he said rba governor philip lowe credit peter braig second is what lowe called structural policies that support firms expanding investing innovating and employing people the government s income tax plans announced in april s budget is one example but lowe probably had in mind more ambitious pro growth reforms the kind that have become rare in australia both alternatives mooted by lowe are politically challenging for the morrison government loading lowe s call means less emphasis on budget repair and more spending on things such as infrastructure that puts the government s much vaunted 2019 20 budget surplus in jeopardy and would delay plans to reduce commonwealth debt both of those commitments were central to the coalition s election pitch also the morrison government s small target election campaign strategy means it has no mandate for the kind of sweeping productivity boosting structural policies to which lowe referred but there are signs the government will be open to a more expansive policy agenda
later in the week president xi jinping travelled to moscow for a three day visit to strengthen trade ties where he described vladimir putin as his best friend as the world waits for beijing to release a list of unreliable entities expected to blacklist american giants such as google and apple in retaliation for trump s crackdown on telecoms giant huawei the contrast with china s actions toward the us could not have been clearer also this week beijing issued travel warnings for students and tourists travelling to the us a clear sign beijing will not hesitate to weaponise its citizens who pour billions of dollars into the us economy each year and there was more on tuesday china s national development and reform commission ndrc met in beijing to discuss ways to promote the country s rare earths industry that also sent out a message china could if it chose seek to use its dominance in the vital materials used to make mobile phones and computers to contain the us on wednesday chinese regulators slapped a 162 million yuan 34 million fine on a joint venture between us carmaker ford and a chinese state owned enterprise while the fine related to setting minimum resale prices on cars it was immediately linked to retaliation against american companies in china the situation is very severe this week we saw significant changes in the attitude of the chinese government china has realised they are not going to reach an agreement with the united states says tu xinquan head of the china institute for wto studies at beijing s university of international business and economics tu believes china and the us are locked into a cycle of punch pain talk where both sides will have to endure a period of economic hardship before being forced back to the negotiating table he argues china is better placed to weather the storm than america because of its long history of enduring hardship the next opportunity for trump and xi to sit down together will be at the g20 summit in osaka at the end of the month but few are hopeful the two leaders will see eye to eye if i had a concern about it it s that the chinese i hope do not come to the conclusion that they can t make a deal with this administration former us secretary of state rex tillerson said this week we ll just wait for the next one i hope that s not what they re moving to i don t believe it is advertisement former australian prime minister kevin rudd believes the chances of a us china free trade deal is now hovering at less than 50 per cent the once unthinkable decoupling of western economies from china as well as the us opening new fronts in mexico and potentially europe is now without question the greatest threat to businesses investors and household living standards the escalation of the trade war is a challenge to the multi lateral trade system it increases risks of the world economy the risk is a complete decoupling says bai ming deputy director of the chinese ministry of commerce s international market research institute as the conflict escalates policy makers around the world are being dragged into the conflict often against their will some like reserve bank of australia governor philip lowe are battening down the hatches delivering this week the first of what is likely to be at least two rate cuts on thursday india cut its benchmark to the lowest in nine years the european central bank has also opened the door to lowering rates i m very concerned about what s happening said lowe citing the incremental erosion of the rules based international system it s a danger to us and other trading economies alarm bells are ringing at the international monetary fund which said this week that us china tariffs including those in place and those threatened will wipe us450 billion from global gross domestic product by next year managing director christine lagarde warned of self inflicted wounds that are costing the us china and global economies in the us the federal reserve appears to be mere weeks away from embarking on a dramatic about face on interest rates financial market bets on a fed cut as early as next month have surged to around 75 per cent and there s a one in four chance it could happen as early as the week after next will the fed turn if chairman jerome powell does go down that path he will have turned us monetary policy into an auxiliary economic weapon in the trade contest for one thing it would be the fastest swing from a rate hike powell hiked in december to a cut since the mid 1990s advertisement the chaos of trump s trade war will have been overwhelmed by the fed s preference for predictability and consistency coming weeks will be decisive on how this all plays out over the past year trump has gradually cranked up his tariff war to the point where almost us250 billion of chinese imports are now being taxed at 25 per cent he has repeatedly threatened to tax the remaining us325 billion of annual chinese shipments unless beijing agrees to major concessions speaking in paris on thursday trump for the first time linked that threat to the outcome of the group of 20 leaders summit in osaka at the end of the month one way or the other i ll make that decision after the g20 i ll be meeting with president xi and we ll see what happens in the meantime the uncertainty continues to weigh on sentiment with trump adding to the turmoil by opening a fresh tariff front this time against mexico which the administration holds responsible for a flood of immigrants hitting the us southern border in recent months while financial markets have rallied on wall street this week on the prospect of fed interest rate relief most analysts are becoming more pessimistic about a resolution between trump and xi even if a truce is announced at the g20 summit later this month we doubt it would last with tariffs extended to the remainder of imports from china later this year said michael pearce senior us economist at capital economics trump will be keen to retain leverage others point to a gathering rush by investors towards havens like gold which has climbed nearly 5 per cent in two weeks and us treasury bonds where yields are falling global trade war risks are metastasising and risk tipping the global economy into a growing recession citigroup analysts including cesar rojas this week advertisement everyone it seems is waking up to the reality that trump not only means business but is also unfazed by the prospect of fighting multiple trade wars at once part of that is a calculation in the white house that the us economy is strong enough to withstand the conflict but his plan to gradually increase tariffs on almost half a trillion dollars of imports from mexico looks to be a bridge too far for many republicans who have pushed back against the president with more countries being dragged into the fight across more products and industries alongside national security and legal clashes on technology such as 5g networks potential costs are rising a simulation undertaken this week by citi s analysts suggest global gdp growth could shudder to a 2 per cent annual pace a year from now a slump akin to the immediate global financial crisis aftermath metastasized trade tensions would not only trigger a series of shocks but would also amplify the feedback among them rojas says even as the tariffs are the catalyst the cascade of effects from financial markets labor markets and confidence channels are the main drags on global activity australia is not immune from these threats even if it seems the country stands to benefit in the short term from the substitution effect of the us china tariffs nomura analysts have crunched a year s worth of trade data to gauge how much trade is being shifted to other countries as the behemoths slug it out australia appears to be benefiting from a boost in natural gas and gold orders from china which is avoiding us sources the total boost over the year from increased shipments to china is equivalent to 0 3 per cent of gdp nomura estimates but none of that will offset a broader global slowdown caused by trade disruption most economists believe the war will wipe around 0 5 per cent off global gdp by the end of next year advertisement there s an important caveat on those numbers they assume the tariff dispute as it stands is a one off hit the big question is whether this trade war is a sign that globalisation is at an end says vicky redwood at capital economics china s ability to weather a trade storm is also under question china s leaders have nationalistic propaganda an unquestioning media and a range of stimulus levers on their side although the economy is slowing and many middle class consumers and businesses are watching their spending capital economics says a likely 25 per cent tariffs on all goods imported from china would lower china s gdp by 0 8 per cent china is expected to post a sharp drop in exports for may when it releases trade data on monday ironically in a week that marked the 30th anniversary of the tiananmen square crackdown many of the country s middle class millennials are more critical of the us government than china s one party political system the sentiment is a far cry from the calls for democracy by student activists in china 30 years ago there is every indication the vast majority of citizens will support the stance of the country s leaders as beijing digs in for a tough fight
the canadian dollar rose on friday as employment reports in both countries told different stories the canadian jobs data impressed by beating expectations with a 27 700 job gain the forecasts were

factors gold is enjoying a boost from investor appetite for the metal as a safe haven while oil prices were supported by russia and saudi arabia signalling their willingness to extend the opec deal russia had been non committal and still hold most of the cards with saudi arabia willing to make some concessions but until an agreement is reached and maybe announced in the meeting between the opec

64 percent gain in that past five trading days the yellow metal took advantage of the nfp miss that showed the us employment component is running out of momentum which could force the central bank

stalled and the market is not expecting anything new before the g20 meeting in japan at the end of the month the us escalated its immigration demands with mexico via a tariff threat that is still very

and news that a saudi arabia and russia pledge to extend the opec production cut agreement the group s attempt to soak up the excess supply in the market in effort to add stability has for the most part worked outside factors such as the rise of us production and trade war concerns putting pressure on global growth have been the major obstacles brent and wti rose close to 3 percent on friday and will finish the trading week with gains despite trade war anxiety the world bank announced a downgrade of global growth as trade disputes are trickling down slowdowns in major economies are evident and if protectionism prevails there will be a slower pace of growth around the globe the upside for the opec is limited as reducing supply is only one part of the equation and with stable prices the appeal of increasing production in the us brazil and canada will be higher as well as the continued negative effect on energy prices that trade disputes can bring the month of june is crucial for crude prices as the opec meets at the end of june with the g20 in japan a couple of days after an extension of the production cut and more details on how the us china are hoping to repair their trade relationship could make a huge difference for crude prices vice versa not reaching an extension on the opec agreement and if the us and china continue to spar on trade will only bring more downward

as interest rates fall towards zero some economists say there is a growing likelihood that the reserve bank will resort to unconventional methods unconventional monetary policy governments in the united states japan and europe were forced to find new ways to stimulate their economies in devastating aftermath of the global financial crisis once interest rates had been slashed to around zero central banks began to purchase bonds from the private sector in a bid to pump cash into the economy the effect was to lower the yield on bonds which sent people into other assets particularly shares as a result this strategy called quantitative easing qe had the effect of boosting stock markets it also aimed to lower longer term interest rates with the purpose of encouraging borrowing by businesses and home buyers amp s chief economist shane oliver who describes qe as using printed money to buy bonds to inject cash into the economy says it appears to have been more effective in america than in europe and japan because it moved quickly to implement the strategy once conventional interest rate policy had reached its lower bound in a speech following tuesday s rate cut reserve bank governor philip lowe said he did not expect interest rates would have to be cut to their lower bound in australia when questioned on what that lower bound might be lowe referred to the recent global experience loading if you look at what happened in the uk the us and canada rates got to 0 25 0 5 per cent there so i think for many economies that s judged to be the effective lower bound he said i m not anticipating we get to those levels top economic officials in australia have frowned on qe in the past in 2016 john fraser then secretary of the commonwealth treasury said a range of different experimental interventions have been tried with mixed results even so economists in academic and business believe quantitative easing is now a possibility in australia as the cash rate falls we are likely to see an increasing debate around whether the rba will use quantitative easing says oliver who was among the first to forecast a reserve bank rate cut in 2019 royal bank of canada economist su lin ong says the rba would much prefer to use their traditional interest rate ammunition but any future deterioration in the global economy will make unconventional monetary policy more likely in australia we know that they are prepared but it s a question of how they do it she said it will look different here to other parts of the world the reserve bank has kept a close eye on the various experiments with unconventional monetary policy since the gfc in december the reserve s deputy governor guy debelle said we have also been able to examine the experience of others with other tools of monetary policy and have learned from that hopefully we won t ever have to put that learning into practice qe is a policy option in australia should it be required other unconventional policies are also possible oliver says it is debatable as to whether qe has been the best approach globally he thinks a more efficient and fairer option may be for the rba to work with the federal government to provide what economists call helicopter money a direct payment to households so they spend and revive growth the rudd government used this strategy with a 900 cash bonus to households to boost spending during the gfc but unconventional monetary policy by the rba is not the only option to lift the australian economy from its torpor with interest rate policy reaching its limits in australia pressure will mount for the government to use fiscal policy to boost growth budget policy and economic reforms since the sweeping reforms of the 1980s including the floating of the dollar and deregulation of financial and labour markets the reserve bank s management of interest rates has been the main tool of economic management but in tuesday s speech lowe warned that there were downsides to relying too much on interest rates there are limitations on what realistically can be achieved he said so as a country we should also be looking at other options to reduce unemployment he offered two alternatives first more government spending on things that boost productivity especially needed infrastructure this spending not only adds to demand in the economy but it also adds to the economy s productive capacity he said rba governor philip lowe credit peter braig second is what lowe called structural policies that support firms expanding investing innovating and employing people the government s income tax plans announced in april s budget is one example but lowe probably had in mind more ambitious pro growth reforms the kind that have become rare in australia both alternatives mooted by lowe are politically challenging for the morrison government loading lowe s call means less emphasis on budget repair and more spending on things such as infrastructure that puts the government s much vaunted 2019 20 budget surplus in jeopardy and would delay plans to reduce commonwealth debt both of those commitments were central to the coalition s election pitch also the morrison government s small target election campaign strategy means it has no mandate for the kind of sweeping productivity boosting structural policies to which lowe referred but there are signs the government will be open to a more expansive policy agenda
you ve heard the axiom history repeats itself it does but never in exactly the same way to apply the lessons of the past we must understand the differences of the present during the american revolution the british came prepared to fight a successful war but against a european army their formations which gave them devastating firepower and their red coats which emphasized their numbers proved the exact opposite of the tactics needed to fight a guerrilla war before world war i generals still saw the cavalry as the flower of their armies of course the horse soldiers proved worse than useless in the trenches before world war ii in anticipation of a german attack the french built the impenetrable maginot line history repeated itself and the attack came but not in the way they expected their preparations were useless because the germans didn t attempt to penetrate it they simply went around it and france was defeated america s great murray n rothbard best price 3 02 buy new 14 16 as of 07 55 utc details the generals don t prepare for the last war out of perversity or stupidity but rather because past experience is all they have to go by most of them simply don t know how to interpret that experience they are correct in preparing for another war but wrong in relying upon what worked in the last one investors unfortunately seem to make the same mistakes in marshaling their resources as do the generals if the last 30 years have been prosperous they base their actions on more prosperity talk of a depression isn t real to them because things are in fact so different from the 1930s to most people a depression means 30s style conditions and since they don t see that they can t imagine a depression that s because they know what the last depression was like but they don t know what one is it s hard to visualize something you don t understand some of them who are a bit more clever might see an end to prosperity and the start of a depression but al though they re going to be a lot better off than most they re probably looking for this depression to be like the last one although nobody can predict with absolute certainty what this depression will be like you can be fairly well assured it won t be an instant replay of the last one but just because things will be different doesn t mean you have to be taken by surprise to define the likely differences between this depres sion and the last one it s helpful to compare the situa tion today to that in the early 1930s the results aren t very reassuring corporate bankruptcy 1930s banks insurance companies and big corporations went under on a major scale institutions suffered the consequences of past mistakes and there was no financial safety net to catch them as they fell mistakes were liquidated and only the prepared and efficient survived today the world s financial institutions are in even worse shape than the last time but now business ethics have changed and everyone expects the government to step in laws are already in place that not only allow but require government inter vention in many instances this time mistakes will be compounded and the strong productive and ef ficient will be forced to subsidize the weak unproductive and inefficient it s ironic that businesses were bankrupted in the last depression because the prices of their products fell too low this time it ll be because they went too high unemployment 1930s if a man lost his job he had to find another one as quickly as possible simply to keep from going hungry a lot of other men in the same position competed desperately for what work was available and an employer could hire those same men for much lower wages and expect them to work harder than what was the case before the depression as a result the men could get jobs and the employer could stay in business today the average man first has months of unemployment insurance after that he can go on welfare if he can t find suitable work instead of taking whatever work is available especially if it means that a white collar worker has to get his hands dirty many will go on welfare this will decrease the production of new wealth and delay the recovery the worker no longer has to worry about some entrepreneur exploiting i e employing him at what he considers an unfair wage because the minimum wage laws among others precludes that possibility today as a result men stay unemployed and employers will go out of business welfare 1930s if hard times really put a man down and out he had little recourse but to rely on his family friends or local social and church group there was quite a bit of opprobrium attached to that and it was only a last resort the breadlines set up by various government bodies were largely cosmetic measures to soothe the more terror prone among the voting populace people made do because they had to and that meant radically reducing their standards of living and taking any job available at any wage there were very very few people on welfare during the last depression today it s hard to say how those who are still working are going to support those who aren t in this depression even in the u s 50 of the country is already on some form of welfare but food stamps aid to fami lies with dependent children social security and local programs are already collapsing in prosperous times and when the tidal wave hits they ll be totally overwhelmed there aren t going to be any breadlines because people who would be standing in them are going to be shopping in local supermarkets just like people who earned their money perhaps the most dangerous aspect of it is that people in general have come to think that these programs can just magically make wealth appear and they expect them to be there while a whole class of people have grown up never learning to survive without them it s ironic yet predictable that the programs that were supposed to help those who need them will serve to devastate those very people regulations 1930s most economies have been fairly heavily regulated since the early 1900s and those regulations caused distortions that added to the severity of the last depression rather than allow the economy to liquidate in the case of the u s the roosevelt regime added many many more regulations fixing prices wages and the manner of doing business in a static form it was largely because of these regulations that the depression lingered on until the end of world war ii which saved the economy only through its massive reinflation of the currency had the government abolished most controls then in existence instead of creating new ones the depression would have been less severe and much shorter today the scores of new agencies set up since the last depression have created far more severe distortions in the ways people relate than those of 80 years ago the potential adjustment needed is proportionately greater unless government restrictions and controls on wages working conditions energy consumption safety and such are removed a dramatic economic turnaround during the greater depression will be impossible taxes 1930s the income tax was new to the u s in 1913 and by 1929 although it took a maximum 23 1 bite that was only at the 1 million level the average family s income then was 2 335 and that put average families in the 1 10th of 1 percent bracket and there was still no social security tax no state income tax no sales tax and no estate tax furthermore most people in the country didn t even pay the income tax because they earned less than the legal minimum or they didn t bother filing the government therefore had immense untapped sources of revenue to draw upon to fund its schemes to cure the depression roosevelt was able to raise the average income tax from 1 35 to 16 56 during his tenure an increase of 1 100 today everyone now pays an income tax in addition to all the other taxes in most western countries the total of direct and indirect taxes is over 50 for that reason it seems unlikely that direct taxes will go much higher but inflation is constantly driving everyone into higher brackets and will have the same effect a person has had to increase his or her income faster than inflation to compensate for taxes whatever taxes a man does pay will reduce his standard of living by just that much and it s reasonable to expect tax evasion and the underground economy to boom in response that will cushion the severity of the depression somewhat while it serves to help change the philosophical orientation of society prices 1930s prices dropped radically because billions of dollars of inflationary currency were wiped out through the stock market crash bond defaults and bank failures the government however somehow equated the high prices of the inflationary 20s with prosperity and attempted to prevent a fall in prices by such things as slaughtering livestock dumping milk in the gutter and enacting price supports since the collapse wiped out money faster than it could be created the government felt the destruction of real wealth was a more effective way to raise prices in other words if you can t increase the supply of money decrease the supply of goods nonetheless the 1930s depression was a deflationary collapse a time when currency became worth more and prices dropped this is probably the most confusing thing to most americans since they assume as a result of that experience that depression means deﬂation it s also perhaps the biggest single difference between this depression and the last one today prices could drop as they did the last time but the amount of power the government now has over the economy is far greater than what was the case 80 years ago instead of letting the economy cleanse itself by allowing the ﬁnancial markets to collapse governments will probably bail out insolvent banks create mortgages wholesale to prop up real estate and central banks will buy bonds to keep their prices from plummeting all of these actions mean that the total money supply will grow enormously trillions will be created to avoid deﬂation if you ﬁnd men selling apples on street corners it won t be for 5 cents apiece but 5 apiece but there won t be a lot of apple sellers because of welfare nor will there be a lot of apples because of price controls consumer prices will probably skyrocket as a result and the country will have an inﬂationary depression unlike the 1930s when people who held dollars were king by the end of the greater depression people with dollars will be wiped out the society 1930s the world was largely rural or small town communications were slow but people tended to trust the media the government exercised considerable moral suasion and people tended to support it the business of the country was business as calvin coolidge said and men who created wealth were esteemed all told if you were going to have a depression it was a rather stable environment for it despite that however there were still plenty of riots marches and general disorder today the country is now urban and suburban and although communications are rapid there s little interpersonal contact the media are suspect the government is seen more as an adversary or an imperial ruler than an arbitrator accepted by a consensus of concerned citizens businessmen are viewed as unscrupulous predators who take advantage of anyone weak enough to be exploited a major financial smashup in today s atmosphere could do a lot more than wipe out a few naives in the stock market and unemploy some workers as occurred in the 30s some sectors of society are now time bombs it s hard to say for instance what third and fourth generation welfare recipients are going to do when the going gets really tough the way people work 1930s relatively slow transportation and communication localized economic conditions the u s itself was somewhat insulated from the rest of the world and parts of the u s were fairly self contained workers were mostly involved in basic agriculture and industry creating widgets and other tangible items there wasn t a great deal of specialization and that made it easier for someone to move laterally from one occupation into the next without extensive retraining since people were more able to produce the basics of life on their own most women never joined the workforce and the wife in a marriage acted as a backup system should the husband lose his job today the whole world is interdependent and a war in the middle east or a revolution in africa can have a direct and immediate effect on a barber in chicago or krakow since the whole economy is centrally controlled from washington a mistake there can be a national disaster people generally aren t in a position to roll with the punches as more than half the people in the country belong to what is known as the service economy that means in most cases they re better equipped to shuffle papers than make widgets even necessary services are often terminated when times get hard specialization is part of what an advanced industrial economy is all about but if the economic order changes radically it can prove a liability the financial markets 1930s the last depression is identified with the collapse of the stock market which lost over 90 of its value from 1929 to 1933 a secure bond was the best possible investment as interest rates dropped radically commodities plummeted reducing millions of farmers to near subsistence levels since most real estate was owned outright and taxes were low a drop in price didn t make a lot of difference unless you had to sell land prices plummeted but since people bought it to use not unload to a greater fool they didn t usually have to sell today this time stocks and especially commodities are likely to explode on the upside as people panic into them to get out of depreciating dollars in general and bonds in particular real estate will be next to bonds the most devastated single area of the economy because no one will lend money long term and real estate is built on the mortgage market which will vanish the politically incorr thomas e woods jr best price 1 51 buy new 8 71 as of 06 15 utc details everybody who invests in this depression thinking that it will turn out like the last one will be very unhappy with the results being aware of the differences between the last depression and this one makes it a lot easier to position yourself to minimize losses and maximize profits so much for the differences the crucial obvious and most important similarity however is that most people s standard of living will fall dramatically the greater depression has started most people don t know it because they can neither confront the thought nor understand the differences between this one and the last as a climax approaches many of the things that you ve built your life around in the past are going to change and change radically the ability to adjust to new conditions is the sign of a psychologically healthy person look for the opportunity side of the crisis the chinese symbol for crisis is a combination of two other symbols one for danger and one for opportunity the dangers that society will face in the years ahead are regrettable but there s no point in allowing anxiety frustration or apathy to overcome you face the future with courage curiosity and optimism rather than fear you can be a winner and if you plan carefully you will be the great period of change will give you a chance to regain control of your destiny and that in itself is the single most important thing in life this depression can give you that opportunity it s one of the many ways the greater depression can be a very good thing for both you as an

new york ny june 3 traders and financial professionals work at the opening bell on the floor of the new york stock exchange nyse june 3 2019 in new york city stocks opened mostly flat on monday morning amid continuing trade tensions between the united states and its major trading partners china and mexico drew angerer getty images afp donald trump likes to point to wall street as a measure of his economic miracle and us stock prices have exhibited a pattern of behavior as erratic as the us commander in chief the dow jones industrial average is trading where it was at the start of 2018 but it has fluctuated wildly in recent months sharp declines and rallies often in the course of a single trading session have become the norm at the end of last year the market dropped 20 percent from its peak meeting the definition of a bear market then in the first quarter it clawed back most of the losses then stock prices started to weaken once more but now there is another rally but for how long actually the erratic behavior of wall street s key indices started earlier notably on the night in november 2016 when donald trump was elected the initial reaction when the voting results started to pour in was highly negative but then there has been a huge reversal stock prices surged and by the time the dow set its all time high at nearly 27 000 last year the stock market added one third of its value thus in just two years a whopping 10 trillion of wealth has been created by wall street the gains moreover came not from a low point such after the 2008 09 sell off but from record highs the dow is an index of 30 bluest of the blue chips the largest and the most solid us companies with tried and true business models and extensive track record they are also the most thoroughly analyzed companies in the world with literally thousands of analysts poring over their balance sheets stock prices represent the discounted present value of all dividends the company will pay out in perpetuity in other words it is a reflection of what investors think is going to happen to the company s profitability in the future obviously there had to be some kind of a seismic shift in the overall economy to warrant such a dramatic repricing of those 30 companies and the creation of all that wealth was the election of trump and the appointment of his cabinet such a seismic shift the trump administration did loosen a number of regulations and environmental protection rules especially those that had been put in place under barack obama that made companies more profitable and cut the red tape and associated expenses however these were marginal changes adding a piddling amount to the corporate bottom line american regulations in any case had been far less onerous than in most other rich industrial countries and us multinationals continue to function successfully under more restrictive regulatory regimes abroad for instance in western europe and then there was the trump tax cut it has always been a scam since it put money into the hands of corporations and the very rich doing very little for the real economy recent studies confirm that it provided no boost to investment or consumption just a short term infusion of liquidity so why does the stock market sustain its value why has it been so resilient with corrections proving to be short lived and followed by new rallies the answer may lie in the nature of pyramid schemes sergei mavrodi who set up a massive pyramid scheme in russia just as the soviet union collapsed complained that his business model was workable his mmm pyramid could have gone on paying dividends to the existing investors forever as long as his well publicized success brought in new investors and confidence in his scheme endured but when the russian government moved in it undermined confidence and the whole thing collapsed it is a spurious argument but it is not without merit large new inflows could continue to buoy the scheme and if the government or some other respectful entity pledged to back it it could have gone on for a very long time as to the long term maynard keynes did once say that in the long run we re all dead the world economy fronted by the us economy and underpinned by the us dollar and dollar denominated financial assets has been in a bubble stage ever since it came out of the 2008 09 great recession this is not to say that the real economy is a bubble industry produces goods businesses provide services farmers grow food and the technology revolution powers ahead at an accelerating pace but in many asset classes there are massive and ultimately unsustainable bubbles like other pyramid schemes they go on because government entities give them their imprimatur and infuse liquidity another successful swindler bernie madoff claimed after the incomplete financial regulations had been enacted following the 2008 global financial crisis that the whole government was a ponzi scheme and now there is a bubble in us stocks and in international bond markets where yields are often negative meaning that governments are paid to pile on debt in real estate markets in key metropolitan areas the property is overpriced by trillions of dollars a collapse of the massively overbuilt new york market alone would send shockwaves through the global financial system there is a corporate debt bubble a consumer debt bubble and a student loan bubble in the united states there is even a bubble in the oil market despite the fact that oil prices have dropped by some 50 percent since 2010 14 and remarkably there is a labor market bubble a record low unemployment rate achieved with the help of a still low labor force participation ephemeral low paying service sector jobs and the uber style gig economy that bubble was in evidence before the financial crisis and all those jobs evaporated within a few months now the situation is far worse these bubbles are interlocking if one bursts it could trigger the bursting of others trump s policies have acted to protect the bubbles and to inflate them further the tax cut infused liquidity into financial markets and high end real estate even his reckless trade wars have been beneficial for stocks and bonds fearing global economic and political turmoil investors are piling into the safest assets which are dollar denominated securities especially us treasuries meanwhile concern about a possible global economic slowdown is making the us federal reserve nervous it has hinted that it may cut interest rates spurring a rally on wall street last week the fed is acting as a government guarantor of a pyramid scheme if something cannot go on forever it will stop said conservative economist herbert stein back in the 1970s accordingly the bubble economy will inevitably come to an end bubbles are bicycle like phenomena they tumble when they stop moving and the stock market has not moved up for a year and a half the bursting of a number of interconnected bubbles may change the configuration of the global economic and political system by antagonizing america s allies and friends and initiating spurious trade conflicts trump is laying the groundwork for america s failure as a world leader the bitcoin which many economists believe is inherently worthless refuses to go away after dropping sharply in late 2018 it has rallied this year possibly it is another bubble but it may also be a troubling indicator for the future of the us dollar as a global reserve currency
by reuters by dhara ranasinghe london reuters after almost three years of successfully predicting a global economic revival world bond markets are furiously flagging the risk of yet another recession as well as low inflation for a generation spooked by the escalating u s china trade war long term interest rates embedded in government bond markets widely seen as the most accurate predictors of future economic activity and inflation have relapsed into deep troughs u s treasury yields have plunged 50 basis points in seven weeks while sub zero german 10 year bond yields are at record lows in japan britain switzerland and france borrowing costs are at their lowest since 2016 when financial markets were hit by a combination of blows including britain s shock decision to leave the european union and an economic slowdown in china recession is not a given bond markets may be pointing that way but some other indicators such as equity markets are not as bearish however trade tensions also including a recent u s plan to impose tariffs on mexico may be what s making the present slide in bond yields different we have to pay attention said franck dixmier global head of fixed income for allianz global which manages more than 560 billion in assets we know from experience that bond markets are quite good at predicting future economic developments and what s being priced in more and more is the consequence of a clear escalation of trade tensions expectations for future inflation globally have tumbled as a result of fears about slowing growth or recession at a time when major central banks have limited ammunition following years of ultra easy monetary policy britain is an exception because of brexit the most prominent bearish signal for economic growth is coming from the u s bond curve where the 3 month 10 year yield curve is near its most inverted since 2007 the months leading up to the global financial crisis an inverted curve where long dated yields are below short dated ones has proved a powerful recessionary indicator in a strong sign that markets are bracing for rate cuts most of the u s curve is below the target range for the federal funds rate of 2 25 2 50 for a graphic on most u s yields fall below fed s target range click short term interest rate futures imply the u s federal reserve could start cutting rates as soon as next month the yield curve is still a very good indicator because when you look at the curve and the correlation between this and macro economic variables this hasn t changed for 20 years said pictet asset management chief strategist luca paolini adding that a recession but not a deep one was likely trust me but reading the bond market tea leaves is not easy the predictive power of the u s bond curve has been hurt by the prolonged easy monetary policy and demand for bonds from institutional investors such as pension and insurance funds that s played a part in suppressing long dated yields making it easier for the

when today friday june 7 2019 where cnbc s squawk box the following are excerpts from the unofficial transcript of a cnbc exclusive interview with billionaire hedge fund manager stanley druckenmiller the founder of duquesne capital on cnbc s squawk box m f 6am 9am today friday june 7th the following is a link to video of the interview on cnbc com all references must be sourced to cnbc stanley druckenmiller on trump tweets us china trade war video joe kernen and that is stanley druckenmiller duquesne family office ceo he s the founder of duquesne capital and you managed that as well as a lot of soros money all at the same i don t know how you did so much at the same time if you don t know this man s record and i m not even talking about being the biggest philanthropist in in the world in i think when was that 2009 stan at 800 million dollars but stanley druckenmiller i can t remember joe kernen yeah alright anyway thirty years without a down market becky quick 39 joe kernen yeah 39 but an average 30 stanley druckenmiller 30 years competing we don t really talk afterward but yeah it is 30 joe kernen and i think after 30 years of not having a down year or getting 30 a year you couldn t do it anymore i don t see how you could do it you would get up every morning worrying i think wouldn t you and that s too much for anyone to try and stanley druckenmiller there was a lot of luck in there i had a lot of big draw downs inner year it s just the way the calendar came out so there was a lot of luck involved with that joe kernen i ve talked to you in recent days and you had an interview that got a lot of play at the economics club and so we ll start by saying so a thousand points today i m sorry 100 points today would bring us up almost a thousand for the week so we ve had a snap back and i asked you you sold everything and you said you know these headlines don t really necessarily cover the nuances of what you ve done in the last couple of weeks right i mean they said you ve sold everything and got in treasuries was that that s not exactly what you did is it stanley druckenmiller no but i did do a lot so i was over 90 invested fat and happy fed look like they were going in the right direction and the sunday of the trump tweet came in monday the market was only down a half or 1 and decided to go to net flat joe kernen that was the first china that was the china stanley druckenmiller the china tweet joe kernen not the mexico tweet stanley druckenmiller the china tweet i just kind of wanted to take a deep breath and process it net flat doesn t mean i sold everything i kept all my long investments and used other vehicles again the other thing i did was i bought a bunch of treasuries just because i wanted and by the way it took me three days i wish i had done it all the first day but didn t have the courage or the gumption or whatever and yeah that s that s what i did and pretty much stayed there until the fed repivot acceleration whatever you want to call it tuesday morning i m nowhere near back to where i was but i ve gotten a little more exposed during a week joe kernen but you also point out and you say a lot of its luck so i mean it looked like you said wow i m going to play i m going to ride these treasuries as they go up and the yields fall but that wasn t one of it you need to go somewhere and have more treasuries and then all of a sudden that was serendipity and the treasury market just took off after you did that too right so it looks like another stanley druckenmiller soros used to have this thing called the one way bet what s a one way bet that s when you very have a lot of conviction that something might not move but if it moves it will only move in one direction so i bought the treasury thinking for example the two year i think it was like two thirty or something if i m wrong it goes to 240 and you can envision a scenario where you could make 150 or 200 basis points so i didn t necessarily think i was going to make money but it was a great risk reward and you re right now that it s down to 185 or wherever it is this morning it s no longer one way bet you could lose 60 70 still could probably make 150 so it s not like it s a bad bet it s just it s nowhere near what it was that particular day joe kernen so you definitely sat up and took notice of what these tariffs might do to what you were pretty happy about and that is deregulation tax reform animal spirits for the markets all these things that did happen in the first couple of years of the trump presidency do you think this is enough of a headwind to really reverse some of all that all those positive things to where you re could we going to a recession could the market have a much bigger pullback than we ve seen so far is that is that all in the horizon you still don t know stanley druckenmiller joe the answer is i don t know but i m managing my own money and i don t need to play every day i m not competing and you said it perfectly i think i called in right after my knee replacement the day after the election joe kernen you did stanley druckenmiller and you guys were great we had a discussion about how none of us understood with cutting taxes and deregulation why the market would go down because trump had been elected and i think we talked about animal spirits in that interview at the time and maybe the economy could grow at 3 under this guy and i wish i had followed my own advice more in action but that s kind of what happened and animal spirits is something you can t measure but confidence matters and you do wonder and the journal had a great piece on this i think tuesday morning you do wonder whether this is enough to kill animal spirits and what do you mean by animal spirits well for example if you re a company and you re thinking about building a plant or doing capital spending i mean really i mean aren t you going to wait now see how this thing is resolved what s going on but i don t know if you calculate the tariffs at least the one we ve had just in and of themselves it doesn t look like it s that damaging but at the same time ben bernanke who s a great great mind got a lot of iq points on me he thought subprime was contained because if you just do the math same thing the tariff thing doesn t look that damaging but if you take all the other effects and confidence and we ve had a few more things down the road since then we had huawei and 5g was going to be one of the great engines of not only u s but global growth that s challenged now we we ve interrupted that supply chain supply chains all over the world have been sort of twisted around people are wondering then we got mexico that one came out of nowhere so there s a lot of uncertainty and i d love to sit here and tell you i have a crystal ball but i just i don t know stanley druckenmiller on gdp video joe kernen you and kevin warsh had been watching the fed and commenting on the fed for a long time it s stanley druckenmiller probably too much yeah joe kernen i mean i have so many questions about this and i m thinking we only have an hour that s was what just ran through my head listening to that you know what i mean becky quick oh no are we going to get through everything right joe kernen that s what i thought but is the fed still isn t there the law of diminishing returns for what they re able to do and we hit that yet i don t think looks like we haven t because they ve we got a pause which bounced us in december and then we got something more recently where there might be a cut and it worked again is it going to always work just because it makes stocks more more valuable stanley druckenmiller no one day i won t work we proved in 2008 at some point you start pushing on us on a string i ll say this i don t understand the fed s monetary framework at all i grew up in an era with volcker and greenspan where monetary policy was primarily used for counter cyclical and when the market excuse me when the economy started running too hot after a period they would lean against it and when it looked like things were softening and rolling over they would lean against that now we have decimal point inflation targets like it s armageddon if it s one point four three two instead of one point six five we re worried about inflation expectations five or ten years down the road we have a two percent two point zero excuse me inflation target that if we don t meet it it s armageddon and i have trouble with that whole the preciseness of it and the attention to it as you know joe we re in well you may not agree with me but i think we re in one of the biggest productivity inflection booms since the late 1800s i am very confident that it s not being measured in real gdp i m also very confident i couldn t measure it so don t think i m ever going to say but i know that we have all these free products out there that don t measure in gdp just a couple of examples somebody at mit did a study and said the average american would pay eighteen thousand dollars a year to use the google search engine i know i d pay more by the way but here s here s just one little anecdote so in 2010 americans took i think or globally took 300 billion pictures okay this year we took two and a half trillion pictures okay and the pictures this year on the phone in your pocket are better than the pictures you were taking with a kodak camera eight years ago and if you look at gdp accounting all right there is no accounting and value for those pictures it s done nothing for gdp in fact you could argue since we used to go in and pay 50 cents per picture when we want to have them developed that added gdp and that s no longer in there so that it now literally subtracts from gdp and i could give you a million other examples stanley druckenmiller on recession video michael santoli if real growth is higher and you have these powerful long term trends that are working in favor of that how is the fed at two and a quarter to two and a half percent short term interest rates restraining that in other words you mentioned that the fed is sort of repivoted because it seems to want to move toward where the market is at this point what s the difference if the fed were at 2 or one and a half or two and a two and a quarter to two and a half of it is right now stanley druckenmiller well because the gig economy is important but it s not the only economy and economics works on the the economy works on the margin and on confidence and there s a lot of whole other areas autos old line retail global trade big that are deteriorating and i actually think the fed is right to be worried i think we could be an inflection point and i think they d be crazy not to think so i have no problem with what chairman powell has done i think he inherited a very tough job my biggest problem is what yellen did we had a booming economy fairly early cycle i know i talked too much about the fed but at the time i said they should sneak one in every time they can until they get to some normal rate i deeply deeply believe in a capitalist system you need a hurdle rate for investment and if that rate is not up there somewhere around three or four people are going to get crazy investors going to get crazy corporations are going to get crazy zombies are going to stay in business and we have the opportunity to get there but that doesn t mean michael santoli well she did sneak one in december 2015 the markets kind of continued falling apart and then they were on hold for a year stanley druckenmiller yeah but we we had that whole period in 2016 where in my opinion they could have gotten to three and a half or four we ll never know but they could have at least tried okay but once confidence turns down you know you got to deal with the hand you re dealt and chairman powell has now got a tough situation on his hand joe kernen you ve evolved stanley druckenmiller if he was at four i d say we should really be cutting and it would be great but we re not at four becky quick but does that mean you think that there are bubbles that have built up in the equity markets and other markets around if there are still zombie companies that are out there have we not shaken things out because we haven t been at three or four percent in a very long time stanley druckenmiller yeah we have 10 trillion in corporate debt we had six trillion i think you and i did an interview for delivering alpha and it was like seven and a half trillion at the time so ironically by trying to achieve escape velocity we are in worse shape for a recession now than if things that slowed down when the period you re talking about mike because there s been a lot of nonsense that s going on since then now we have the global trade situation so you just you don t know joe kernen you re from what i m hearing your views have evolved on on the fed at this point and i like what you re saying because it s a much more i think positive place that it puts us if it s productivity and innovation and technology that has us stuck in this low interest rate environment and i agree with you said you don t know if i agree with it i ve been saying do you know what i d pay for google maps what would i pay for google maps it has changed my when am i going to get somewhere oh i know when i have to leave i know when i have to leave because it says like oh but there s traffic on that right if i had that when i lived in l a i would i would have gone off the freeways instead of being so i would have been able save seven years of my life with google maps stanley druckenmiller by the way this affects inflation too joe kernen yeah stanley druckenmiller quality adjustment joe kernen that s that s why rates are so low stanley druckenmiller if this was measured properly we re probably already in deflation by the way that s a good thing we have good deflations and bad deflations that s my objection to the 2 inflation target for all seasons in the late 1800s in the in the industrial revolution we had three percent deflation and we are growing at eight percent real so i don t know where we are i don t know whether we re at zero whether we re at one or we re at two but i wish would stop worrying about it because we re in a productivity shock and this thing can t be measured so to sit there and count decimal points until at least a the economic statistics catch up with what s happened the preciseness i just think is but joe kernen this thing didn t exist 15 years ago how much is this thing worth and what this is capable i have the encyclopedia britannica everywhere i go i mean i mean i don t even know what andrew does on this thing stanley druckenmiller i m glad you mentioned the encyclopedia britannica because used to pay for that yeah and that added to gdp so relative to now that s a negative becky quick music i listen to music stanley druckenmiller now by the way i m not an idiot i know that some of this shows up in advertising but a lot of that is coming out of tv and the whole value there s no way michael santoli well you re large your point is that we re not correct if the fed is not correct to fear the japan scenario in this instance stanley druckenmiller no not at all michael santoli and it explains why treasury yields are where they are probably stanley druckenmiller yeah and this whole obsession with a zero bound you know why we re at the zero bound because they put rates at the zero bound we have never had deflation that i can find that started because we were near the zero bound we have deflation in every instant because there was an asset bubble so if i was trying to create deflation like i m in this evil darth vader like let s create deflation i would have been done exactly what the fed did from 2012 until a couple of years ago becky quick i m completely confused do you feel good about things right now we re bad stanley druckenmiller i m worried about the long term because you know and i don t like the victory laps about how great things are because we ve used monetary policy to create a lot of build ups by the way i haven t even gone into what the government s done becky quick well not just federal governments but state governments too stanley druckenmiller there s no way we d be looking at a trillion dollar deficit at full employment and no one would mind if the government hadn t been if the fed hadn t been running policy to enable these guys and then you have president trump running around saying well we need to keep interest rates low because the debt is high well jesus why do you think the debt is high and if you went to debt to explode more just keep interest rates low i m concerned about the long term as a practitioner i don t my central case is we re not going into a recession i m worried about it and with the with the new view of the fed you know i m a liquidity guy i m not worried i m not that worried about markets right you stanley druckenmiller on capital gains video stanley druckenmiller i m going to shock you i kind of agree with biden i don t i don t really think capital gains promote investment as much as advertised out there and it s hard for me to believe larry page and mark zuckerberg and jeff bezos would have said oh my god the capital gains tax is going to be 35 i m not going to i m not going to try and found amazon or google so i don t have a problem with it but you probably want to you wouldn t want to expand entitlements you d probably want to fix entitlements and debt with the money you raised stanley druckenmiller yes joe i m still a conservative don t worry i don t want to give you a heart attack over there i would also not be giving like tax breaks for buying used corporate jets i get the new jets okay somebody has to make them you get employment and all that but used jets so there s all kinds of stuff in the tax system the problem with the capital gains hike and i don t really know the answer is it might not raise that much revenue and i m not i m not into something just because it s fair but frankly i think i kind of agree with biden but i did want to say this you know how we could solve inequality very easily of welt just do something disastrous to the economy the stock market would go down 40 and inequality would drop substantially robert frank well that s what worked it fell in 2008 that s exactly what happened stanley druckenmiller of course robert frank we had the biggest decrease in inequality since the 1970s stanley druckenmiller and that s the problem of this whole argument today i mean a little known fact because the media doesn t want to put it out there is real wages have gone up under trump it s the first time it s happened i think in 40 years and we all know african american employment is up because president trump tells us every 10 minutes we all know other minorities and so the bottom is doing better the problem is the top the differential is getting even bigger and even though it s one of the seven deadly sins one of the most powerful human emotions is envy so the narrative about inequality is correct but one piece of the story is left out is that everybody is doing better unfortunately the people that are really accelerating so i don t believe the way to solve this is let s just ruin everything and then everybody will be worse off for it robert frank right but the inverse of that which is what the conservatives say well growth will solve everything in fact during high growth periods inequality increases so it doesn t solve inequality i am shocked though that you re saying you would support a higher capital gains rate you re a guy that i would guess makes a large share of your income from capital gains right stanley druckenmiller i wish i m too short term but i have had substantial capital gains but it s no robert frank so has that changed for you was there a time when you wouldn t have but now stanley druckenmiller i ve never been big on robert frank what should the rate be what do you think is a fair rate for it should it be taxed the same as income 37 there was a time when they were the same stanley druckenmiller i wouldn t have a problem with that but then don t tell me you re going to raise the 37 to 50 and it s going up on both of them robert frank right stanley druckenmiller okay as far as i m concerned they didn t do tax reform okay we did some tax reform in 86 this wasn t tax reform if anything the thing became even more complicated but i would have no problem with normalizing capital gains i hope i m not wrong because i could be to me you don t want to raise any taxes unless you re going to raise revenue i don t want to raise capital gains taxes because i want to hurt somebody joe kernen do you think the marginal rate is at the right level right now stanley druckenmiller i don t know i m a laffer curve guy i don t know where we are you know we know it s between zero and a hundred i don t know which it is joe kernen but would you do we need to that you ve mentioned seventy cents of every dollar i mean that s a problem is it not stanley druckenmiller what s seventy cents robert frank who is paying stanley druckenmiller oh the entitlements joe kernen the entitlements i mean if we do anything with increased revenue i mean spending should still probably be cut and we need to address entitlements stanley druckenmiller we don t even need to cut entitlement spending we just need to slow them down or make them grow at zero and all our problems go away joe kernen it s not exactly stanley druckenmiller they all went up over five or six percent last year what nominal gdp growth less than that they re still gaining and by the way we haven t even gotten into the really demographic the gray boom spot i talked about twelve years ago if you remember i m sure you don t i thought the real consequences won t screw up until 2025 2030 i said this in 2012 well it s not 2025 yet but we re getting there stanley druckenmiller on minimum wage and charter schools video becky quick let s talk minimum wage and much more with our special guest today stanley druckenmiller who is the ceo of duquesne family office stan you saw what bernie had to say you were watching this week as it was coming out and you sent us an email because i got you a little fired up what do you think about it stanley druckenmiller well first of all on the minimum wage we just had a discussion about innovation we didn t we didn t go into the cloud and to me the choice is it s not minimum wage versus a wage it s minimum wage versus no wage and if you want to hurt workers with what s going on with the alternatives with technology jack the minimum wage up enough and you ll have job losses as a result so it doesn t make a lot of sense to me but the thing that really enraged me that comrade sanders said was his comment about charter schools i ve spent the better part of my life one of the great joys of my life was meeting geoff canada it s funny i was talking to fiona last night to have met geoff geoff canada and ken langone and have them both in my life for over 30 years i mean what a privilege and what luck but getting back on topic when he says he s against charter schools i know the man just doesn t care about inequality all he cares about power because that is disruptive to the african american community who prefers this and the only way you get out of inequality is with education at the early level and giving everybody on this in this country a shot and believe me this myth about pulling up your bootstraps and you know i m going to make it that s fine for ninety ninety five percent of the population but there are communities out there where these kids have no shot because the public schools are just so terrible they re never going to be able to compete in our economy and for sanders i assume he s in the pocket of the teacher s unions i don t know why said it but how in the world can you be against charter schools if you re serious about the inequality issue becky quick and we should tell people about the work you ve done in harlem how long have you been there stanley druckenmiller well i ve been there i met geoff in 1993 but it s geoff s work it s not mine but we re serving 13 000 kids and 25 000 families in a hundred blocks of central harlem we ve moved the needle on every single metric and becky if you just even drive up there and i showed you pictures of 25 years ago you won t even believe what s out in the community our biggest problem is gentrification which is a high class problem relative what we re looking at and what s really cool is the harlem children s zone model which by the way geoffrey and anne not me is being replicated in communities all over the country obama s promise neighborhoods started it so we re not just affecting like 13 000 kids up there now it s becoming a nationwide thing and i think it s one of the answers one to the whole to the whole inequality issue so it s very exciting becky quick when you see hundreds of millions of dollars poured into a system like the newark school system without really decent results to show for any of that what do you think stanley druckenmiller it broke my heart but you know i hate to say it because i know i know you re going to have viewers who passionately disagree but i m just not a believer in government being the most effective actor and this whole tax debate is interesting because i understand i really do understand why people want higher taxes and they think that s the solution inequality but you also need to understand i d much much rather have a jeff canada implementing programs and use his talents through private sector donors and donors that hold his organization accountable rather than letting the government becky quick just to be clear you think that s a solution for the five percent of communities where you re not getting decent public schools correct you don t think that this is something i mean i m a product of the public schools for most of my life my mom was a public schoolteacher my kids are in the public schools stanley druckenmiller we re in the public schools in harlem we re not one of the big myths perceptions about harlem children s zone is we re a charter school network a that s a small piece of what we do up there we have baby college we have pre k we have employment and technology centers you know basically from cradle to college we re all over these kids and all over the process but we deeply deeply believe in public schools so that s not that s not what i m talking about here i m just saying that there are kids that need a shot and it cannot be done just through charter schools and by the way if they re charter schools that are not performing they should be shut down stanley druckenmiller on job numbers video becky quick are jobs numbers important today stanley druckenmiller i think they re very important there s a technical thing when you have five weeks in may that could bias the number upward the seasonal adjustment they re important only because they affect the fed i don t use the job numbers to predict the economy it s just unbelievable the obsession with a lagging indicator i use them for entry and exit points to fade but i think if the job number is weak given everything else they re saying the fed will be on a clearer easing path by july for more information contact jennifer dauble cnbc t 201 735 4721 m 201 615 2787 e jennifer dauble

why is us dollar access so restrained in china as trade war rages on while china s capital controls have limited how much access its citizens have to foreign currencies at home banks and companies are finding it harder to obtain us dollars as the trade war not only hinders the nation s ability to earn dollar revenue from exports but also foreign lenders willingness to supply the us dollar to a slowing economy china s central bank has been picking up its rhetoric to assure the public that economic fundamentals and policymakers competence would ensure that both the safety of the nation s financial system and the yuan s exchange rate are well under control but beijing s decision to step up capital controls a growing number of analysts have said underscores the perilous state of the economy which was also reflected by the recent reluctance of foreign financial institutions to lend to chinese banks and the nervous behaviour of chinese citizens recent cases of individuals refused permission to buy us dollars at chinese banks have started to accumulate including one which involved a former central bank adviser yu yongding people are thinking if china s future is so strong and stable why aren t we allowed to buy dollars said michael every asia pacific senior strategist at rabobank the harder it is to get around the capital controls the more people want to obtain dollars the nation s foreign exchange regulator the state administration of foreign exchanges safe allows every chinese citizen to exchange and withdraw up to us 50 000 a year in foreign currency either in a lump sum or in instalments but chinese individuals and companies still face major hurdles within that quota in the examination of their applications and declarations that indicate how and when the foreign exchange purchases are to be spent additionally banks are carefully scrutinising foreign currency withdrawals of us 3 000 or more in any single transaction down from us 5 000 previously china had also set rules to ban some banks from allowing customers overseas currency transfers to be used for speculation buying of overseas insurance policies foreign stocks or luxurious flats in cities such as vancouver and san francisco companies also require government approval to purchase property abroad and these approvals are hard to come by unless property acquisitions are their primary business currency transfers abroad are meant to be restricted to normal and legitimate business activities such as tourism schooling business travel and medical care but beijing on tuesday issued a travel advisory for chinese citizens planning to go to the us the latest salvo in the trade battle citing shootings robbery and harassment as reasons for the alert last month in a routine disclosure of its foreign exchange disciplinary cases safe named and shamed 17 banks companies and individuals for trying to illegal transfer money out of china in one case a man identified only by his surname hong was fined 24 97 million yuan us 3 6 million for purchasing 312 million yuan us 45 2 million worth of foreign exchanges to buy homes abroad between february 2011 and october 2015 beijing is clamping down on outflows because it needs to head off the possibility of a significant economic and financial upheaval especially if it fails to reach an agreement with the united states at the g20 meeting this month leading us president donald trump to proceed in july with a tariff of up to 25 per cent on the remaining us 300 billion of chinese imports that are not now subject to sanctions analysts said is letting very little money to go out every time when they try to let go out the markets get too volatile for to stand and they need to stop it immediately said kevin lai chief economist for asia excluding japan at daiwa capital markets the domestic demand for dollars coupled with the growing wariness in the global capital markets to provide us dollar funding to chinese banks seen as increasingly risky are raising the possibly of a systemic dollar shortage one of washington s main demands in talks to end the trade war is for a smaller state role in china s economy and financial system analyst john paul smith in a research note published on the fintech research network smartkarma said that for beijing to do that would almost certainly trigger a systemic event as many inefficient chinese firms would fail without government intervention last month china s bank regulator bailed out city commercial bank baoshang bank which was collapsing under extensive and hidden credit risks after a massive expansion over the past few years while the people s bank of china pboc the nation s central bank gave its assurance that the bailout was a one off case the incident has reinforced concerns about financial risks in china right now china is viewed as a tremendous and growing risk in terms of economic downside and financial risks said jeffrey snider head of research at alhambra investments the reason for any reluctance to lend us dollars to local chinese banks freely has to do with risk perceptions foreign buying of yuan assets including bonds and equities has also declined recently reflecting worries over yuan depreciation and the difficulty for foreigners to justify putting more money into china s markets and committing to the country smith said the trade war makes matters exponentially worse if china can t earn us dollars from exports to the us said analysts which would rapidly push the current account into deficit domestic demand for us dollars is rising sharply because of exporters reluctance to repatriate dollars earned abroad amid fears over yuan depreciation and escalating trade tensions for years us dollars have been entering china as payment for cheap chinese exports and through foreign investments at the same time chinese firms relied on the us dollars they earned to pay for needed raw materials and technology for making their manufactured goods as well as to make overseas investments but the hot money inflows that stocked the yuan s rapid appreciation also became china s headache that was hurting the competitiveness of its exporters in the years leading up to 2014 the pboc had to regularly buy up excess us dollars flowing into chinese banks in exchange for yuan to curb the strength of its exchange rate as a result a significant quantity of these dollars ended up in the nation s foreign exchange reserves which at their peak exceeded us 4 trillion the yuan s appreciating trajectory started to reverse in 2015 as the economy slowed the pboc was forced to burn through us 1 trillion us 144 billion of its reserve to defend its currency and safeguard its financial system after it devalued the yuan by nearly 3 per cent against the us dollar over two days triggered investor panic across global financial markets the pboc s foreign exchange reserves have stabilised at around us 3 1 trillion in recent years but only because authorities have stepped up with the country s capital controls and clamped down on outbound remittances rabobank s every said that while china was trying to hold onto its us dollars by stopping people from taking money abroad through capital controls that will be effective in the short term it could also be cutting itself off from the rest of the world rather than integrating with it source

by dhara ranasinghe london reuters after almost three years of successfully predicting a global economic revival world bond markets are furiously flagging the risk of yet another recession as well as low inflation for a generation spooked by the escalating u s china trade war long term interest rates embedded in government bond markets widely seen as the most accurate predictors of future economic activity and inflation have relapsed into deep troughs u s treasury yields have plunged 50 basis points in seven weeks while sub zero german 10 year bond yields are at record lows in japan britain switzerland and france borrowing costs are at their lowest since 2016 when financial markets were hit by a combination of blows including britain s shock decision to leave the european union and an economic slowdown in china recession is not a given bond markets may be pointing that way but some other indicators such as equity markets are not as bearish however trade tensions also including a recent u s plan to impose tariffs on mexico may be what s making the present slide in bond yields different we have to pay attention said franck dixmier global head of fixed income for allianz de global which manages more than 560 billion in assets we know from experience that bond markets are quite good at predicting future economic developments and what s being priced in more and more is the consequence of a clear escalation of trade tensions expectations for future inflation globally have tumbled as a result of fears about slowing growth or recession at a time when major central banks have limited ammunition following years of ultra easy monetary policy britain is an exception because of brexit the most prominent bearish signal for economic growth is coming from the u s bond curve where the 3 month 10 year yield curve is near its most inverted since 2007 the months leading up to the global financial crisis an inverted curve where long dated yields are below short dated ones has proved a powerful recessionary indicator in a strong sign that markets are bracing for rate cuts most of the u s curve is below the target range for the federal funds rate of 2 25 2 50 short term interest rate futures imply the u s federal reserve could start cutting rates as soon as next month the yield curve is still a very good indicator because when you look at the curve and the correlation between this and macro economic variables this hasn t changed for 20 years said pictet asset management chief strategist luca paolini adding that a recession but not a deep one was likely share of negative yielding debt most u s yields fall below fed s target range euro zone inflation expectations hit record low trust me but reading the bond market tea leaves is not easy the predictive power of the u s bond curve has been hurt by the prolonged easy monetary policy and demand for bonds from institutional investors such as pension and insurance funds that s played a part in suppressing long dated yields making it easier for the curve to invert u s unemployment has always risen before recessions but is currently near 50 year lows equities are holding up well as are the riskier sections of the corporate bond market economic data too while disappointing has not been dire in the united states the institute for supply management s ism manufacturing activity index is at its lowest level since 2016 but above the 50 mark consistent with expansion bluebay asset management s chief investment officer mark dowding notes that in 2016 when fears about weak global growth and inflation last gripped markets the ism plunged to 48 and oil prices slumped to around 30 now oil prices while at 4 month lows are double the levels three years ago trade war weak economy but the deep trade tensions at play today could make this situation different according to analysts and investors u s two year treasury yields last week notched up their biggest weekly fall since 2009 just as u s president donald trump vowed to impose tariffs on mexico while markets had until last month broadly expected a constructive outcome neil mackinnon global macro strategist at vtb capital said that now investors see the dispute as part of a larger more complex long term hegemonic battle and for markets that is more dangerous and uncertain investment banks have changed their views on growth and central bank policy morgan stanley nyse now projects global growth will stagnate at current levels for the rest of 2019 jpmorgan nyse expects two u s rate cuts this year and goldman sachs nyse says its downside risk scenario for german bund yields is 50 basis points versus the current 0 25 bps the international monetary fund meanwhile cut its world growth forecasts this week and germany s central bank also slashed predictions for the country s economy expecting it grow this year by just 0 6 some central banks have moved to easing mode already new zealand australia and india have cut rates and even fed officials have raised that possibility against that backdrop of rate cut bets we have to ask is that consistent with investors thinking the fed is fine tuning policy or is there a fundamental economic backdrop that s far worse than we had thought said sunil krishnan head of multi asset funds at aviva lon investors some of the buying interest in treasuries is taking the more pessimistic view european central bank chief mario draghi this week sought to reassure investors the bank was ready to act if needed even holding out the prospect of more rate cuts or resuming bond buying stimulus nervous investors plowed a record 12 3 billion into higher quality investment grade bonds in the week to wednesday bank of america merrill lynch nyse said and the pool of negative yielding bonds globally has swelled to over 10 trillion banks estimate absent inflation for central banks especially the ecb perhaps the most worrying bond market signal is that inflation will remain below target for years market pricing of inflation expectations in the euro area suggest inflation could remain below target for at least two decades a key market gauge of euro area inflation expectations is at record lows below 1 25 the ecb targets an inflation rate of just below 2 but it has undershot this since 2013 and that s after unprecedented stimulus it seems to be very difficult to see inflation going above target on a 5 10 year view said bluebay s dowding and even if trade tensions and with it global recession fears ebb other uncertainties brexit italy s budget clash with the eu suggest bonds will hold their cachet for some time said dixmier at allianz there is one thing i know he added and that s that i don t want to be short of german bunds at this stage

tablet or email to your colleagues q1 hedge fund letters conference scoops etc stanley f druckenmiller on trump tweets us china trade war joe kernen and that is stanley f druckenmiller duquesne family office ceo he s the founder of duquesne capital and you managed that as well as a lot of soros money all at the same i don t know how you did so much at the same time if you don t know this man s record and i m not even talking about being the biggest philanthropist in in the world in i think when was that 2009 stan at 800 million dollars but stanley f druckenmiller i can t remember joe kernen yeah alright anyway thirty years without a down market becky quick 39 joe kernen yeah 39 but an average 30 stanley f druckenmiller 30 years competing we don t really talk afterward but yeah it is 30 joe kernen and i think after 30 years of not having a down year or getting 30 a year you couldn t do it anymore i don t see how you could do it you would get up every morning worrying i think wouldn t you and that s too much for anyone to try and stanley f druckenmiller there was a lot of luck in there i had a lot of big draw downs inner year it s just the way the calendar came out so there was a lot of luck involved with that joe kernen i ve talked to you in recent days and you had an interview that got a lot of play at the economics club and so we ll start by saying so a thousand points today i m sorry 100 points today would bring us up almost a thousand for the week so we ve had a snap back and i asked you you sold everything and you said you know these headlines don t really necessarily cover the nuances of what you ve done in the last couple of weeks right i mean they said you ve sold everything and got in treasuries was that that s not exactly what you did is it stanley f druckenmiller no but i did do a lot so i was over 90 invested fat and happy fed look like they were going in the right direction and the sunday of the trump tweet came in monday the market was only down a half or 1 and decided to go to net flat joe kernen that was the first china that was the china stanley f druckenmiller the china tweet joe kernen not the mexico tweet stanley f druckenmiller the china tweet i just kind of wanted to take a deep breath and process it net flat doesn t mean i sold everything i kept all my long investments and used other vehicles again the other thing i did was i bought a bunch of treasuries just because i wanted and by the way it took me three days i wish i had done it all the first day but didn t have the courage or the gumption or whatever and yeah that s that s what i did and pretty much stayed there until the fed repivot acceleration whatever you want to call it tuesday morning i m nowhere near back to where i was but i ve gotten a little more exposed during a week joe kernen but you also point out and you say a lot of its luck so i mean it looked like you said wow i m going to play i m going to ride these treasuries as they go up and the yields fall but that wasn t one of it you need to go somewhere and have more treasuries and then all of a sudden that was serendipity and the treasury market just took off after you did that too right so it looks like another stanley f druckenmiller soros used to have this thing called the one way bet what s a one way bet that s when you very have a lot of conviction that something might not move but if it moves it will only move in one direction so i bought the treasury thinking for example the two year i think it was like two thirty or something if i m wrong it goes to 240 and you can envision a scenario where you could make 150 or 200 basis points so i didn t necessarily think i was going to make money but it was a great risk reward and you re right now that it s down to 185 or wherever it is this morning it s no longer one way bet you could lose 60 70 still could probably make 150 so it s not like it s a bad bet it s just it s nowhere near what it was that particular day joe kernen so you definitely sat up and took notice of what these tariffs might do to what you were pretty happy about and that is deregulation tax reform animal spirits for the markets all these things that did happen in the first couple of years of the trump presidency do you think this is enough of a headwind to really reverse some of all that all those positive things to where you re could we going to a recession could the market have a much bigger pullback than we ve seen so far is that is that all in the horizon you still don t know stanley f druckenmiller joe the answer is i don t know but i m managing my own money and i don t need to play every day i m not competing and you said it perfectly i think i called in right after my knee replacement the day after the election joe kernen you did stanley f druckenmiller and you guys were great we had a discussion about how none of us understood with cutting taxes and deregulation why the market would go down because trump had been elected and i think we talked about animal spirits in that interview at the time and maybe the economy could grow at 3 under this guy and i wish i had followed my own advice more in action but that s kind of what happened and animal spirits is something you can t measure but confidence matters and you do wonder and the journal had a great piece on this i think tuesday morning you do wonder whether this is enough to kill animal spirits and what do you mean by animal spirits well for example if you re a company and you re thinking about building a plant or doing capital spending i mean really i mean aren t you going to wait now see how this thing is resolved what s going on but i don t know if you calculate the tariffs at least the one we ve had just in and of themselves it doesn t look like it s that damaging but at the same time ben bernanke who s a great great mind got a lot of iq points on me he thought subprime was contained because if you just do the math same thing the tariff thing doesn t look that damaging but if you take all the other effects and confidence and we ve had a few more things down the road since then we had huawei and 5g was going to be one of the great engines of not only u s but global growth that s challenged now we we ve interrupted that supply chain supply chains all over the world have been sort of twisted around people are wondering then we got mexico that one came out of nowhere so there s a lot of uncertainty and i d love to sit here and tell you i have a crystal ball but i just i don t know stanley f druckenmiller on gdp joe kernen you and kevin warsh had been watching the fed and commenting on the fed for a long time it s stanley f druckenmiller probably too much yeah joe kernen i mean i have so many questions about this and i m thinking we only have an hour that s was what just ran through my head listening to that you know what i mean becky quick oh no are we going to get through everything right joe kernen that s what i thought but is the fed still isn t there the law of diminishing returns for what they re able to do and we hit that yet i don t think looks like we haven t because they ve we got a pause which bounced us in december and then we got something more recently where there might be a cut and it worked again is it going to always work just because it makes stocks more more valuable stanley f druckenmiller no one day i won t work we proved in 2008 at some point you start pushing on us on a string i ll say this i don t understand the fed s monetary framework at all i grew up in an era with volcker and greenspan where monetary policy was primarily used for counter cyclical and when the market excuse me when the economy started running too hot after a period they would lean against it and when it looked like things were softening and rolling over they would lean against that now we have decimal point inflation targets like it s armageddon if it s one point four three two instead of one point six five we re worried about inflation expectations five or ten years down the road we have a two percent two point zero excuse me inflation target that if we don t meet it it s armageddon and i have trouble with that whole the preciseness of it and the attention to it as you know joe we re in well you may not agree with me but i think we re in one of the biggest productivity inflection booms since the late 1800s i am very confident that it s not being measured in real gdp i m also very confident i couldn t measure it so don t think i m ever going to say but i know that we have all these free products out there that don t measure in gdp just a couple of examples somebody at mit did a study and said the average american would pay eighteen thousand dollars a year to use the google search engine i know i d pay more by the way but here s here s just one little anecdote so in 2010 americans took i think or globally took 300 billion pictures okay this year we took two and a half trillion pictures okay and the pictures this year on the phone in your pocket are better than the pictures you were taking with a kodak camera eight years ago and if you look at gdp accounting all right there is no accounting and value for those pictures it s done nothing for gdp in fact you could argue since we used to go in and pay 50 cents per picture when we want to have them developed that added gdp and that s no longer in there so that it now literally subtracts from gdp and i could give you a million other examples stanley f druckenmiller on recession michael santoli if real growth is higher and you have these powerful long term trends that are working in favor of that how is the fed at two and a quarter to two and a half percent short term interest rates restraining that in other words you mentioned that the fed is sort of repivoted because it seems to want to move toward where the market is at this point what s the difference if the fed were at 2 or one and a half or two and a two and a quarter to two and a half of it is right now stanley f druckenmiller well because the gig economy is important but it s not the only economy and economics works on the the economy works on the margin and on confidence and there s a lot of whole other areas autos old line retail global trade big that are deteriorating and i actually think the fed is right to be worried i think we could be an inflection point and i think they d be crazy not to think so i have no problem with what chairman powell has done i think he inherited a very tough job my biggest problem is what yellen did we had a booming economy fairly early cycle i know i talked too much about the fed but at the time i said they should sneak one in every time they can until they get to some normal rate i deeply deeply believe in a capitalist system you need a hurdle rate for investment and if that rate is not up there somewhere around three or four people are going to get crazy investors going to get crazy corporations are going to get crazy zombies are going to stay in business and we have the opportunity to get there but that doesn t mean michael santoli well she did sneak one in december 2015 the markets kind of continued falling apart and then they were on hold for a year stanley f druckenmiller yeah but we we had that whole period in 2016 where in my opinion they could have gotten to three and a half or four we ll never know but they could have at least tried okay but once confidence turns down you know you got to deal with the hand you re dealt and chairman powell has now got a tough situation on his hand joe kernen you ve evolved stanley f druckenmiller if he was at four i d say we should really be cutting and it would be great but we re not at four becky quick but does that mean you think that there are bubbles that have built up in the equity markets and other markets around if there are still zombie companies that are out there have we not shaken things out because we haven t been at three or four percent in a very long time stanley f druckenmiller yeah we have 10 trillion in corporate debt we had six trillion i think you and i did an interview for delivering alpha and it was like seven and a half trillion at the time so ironically by trying to achieve escape velocity we are in worse shape for a recession now than if things that slowed down when the period you re talking about mike because there s been a lot of nonsense that s going on since then now we have the global trade situation so you just you don t know joe kernen you re from what i m hearing your views have evolved on on the fed at this point and i like what you re saying because it s a much more i think positive place that it puts us if it s productivity and innovation and technology that has us stuck in this low interest rate environment and i agree with you said you don t know if i agree with it i ve been saying do you know what i d pay for google maps what would i pay for google maps it has changed my when am i going to get somewhere oh i know when i have to leave i know when i have to leave because it says like oh but there s traffic on that right if i had that when i lived in l a i would i would have gone off the freeways instead of being so i would have been able save seven years of my life with google maps stanley f druckenmiller by the way this affects inflation too joe kernen yeah stanley f druckenmiller quality adjustment joe kernen that s that s why rates are so low stanley f druckenmiller if this was measured properly we re probably already in deflation by the way that s a good thing we have good deflations and bad deflations that s my objection to the 2 inflation target for all seasons in the late 1800s in the in the industrial revolution we had three percent deflation and we are growing at eight percent real so i don t know where we are i don t know whether we re at zero whether we re at one or we re at two but i wish would stop worrying about it because we re in a productivity shock and this thing can t be measured so to sit there and count decimal points until at least a the economic statistics catch up with what s happened the preciseness i just think is but joe kernen this thing didn t exist 15 years ago how much is this thing worth and what this is capable i have the encyclopedia britannica everywhere i go i mean i mean i don t even know what andrew does on this thing stanley f druckenmiller i m glad you mentioned the encyclopedia britannica because used to pay for that yeah and that added to gdp so relative to now that s a negative becky quick music i listen to music stanley f druckenmiller now by the way i m not an idiot i know that some of this shows up in advertising but a lot of that is coming out of tv and the whole value there s no way michael santoli well you re large your point is that we re not correct if the fed is not correct to fear the japan scenario in this instance stanley f druckenmiller no not at all michael santoli and it explains why treasury yields are where they are probably stanley f druckenmiller yeah and this whole obsession with a zero bound you know why we re at the zero bound because they put rates at the zero bound we have never had deflation that i can find that started because we were near the zero bound we have deflation in every instant because there was an asset bubble so if i was trying to create deflation like i m in this evil darth vader like let s create deflation i would have been done exactly what the fed did from 2012 until a couple of years ago becky quick i m completely confused do you feel good about things right now we re bad stanley f druckenmiller i m worried about the long term because you know and i don t like the victory laps about how great things are because we ve used monetary policy to create a lot of build ups by the way i haven t even gone into what the government s done becky quick well not just federal governments but state governments too stanley f druckenmiller there s no way we d be looking at a trillion dollar deficit at full employment and no one would mind if the government hadn t been if the fed hadn t been running policy to enable these guys and then you have president trump running around saying well we need to keep interest rates low because the debt is high well jesus why do you think the debt is high and if you went to debt to explode more just keep interest rates low i m concerned about the long term as a practitioner i don t my central case is we re not going into a recession i m worried about it and with the with the new view of the fed you know i m a liquidity guy i m not worried i m not that worried about markets right you stanley f druckenmiller on capital gains stanley f druckenmiller i m going to shock you i kind of agree with biden i don t i don t really think capital gains promote investment as much as advertised out there and it s hard for me to believe larry page and mark zuckerberg and jeff bezos would have said oh my god the capital gains tax is going to be 35 i m not going to i m not going to try and found amazon or google so i don t have a problem with it but you probably want to you wouldn t want to expand entitlements you d probably want to fix entitlements and debt with the money you raised stanley f druckenmiller yes joe i m still a conservative don t worry i don t want to give you a heart attack over there i would also not be giving like tax breaks for buying used corporate jets i get the new jets okay somebody has to make them you get employment and all that but used jets so there s all kinds of stuff in the tax system the problem with the capital gains hike and i don t really know the answer is it might not raise that much revenue and i m not i m not into something just because it s fair but frankly i think i kind of agree with biden but i did want to say this you know how we could solve inequality very easily of welt just do something disastrous to the economy the stock market would go down 40 and inequality would drop substantially robert frank well that s what worked it fell in 2008 that s exactly what happened stanley f druckenmiller of course robert frank we had the biggest decrease in inequality since the 1970s stanley f druckenmiller and that s the problem of this whole argument today i mean a little known fact because the media doesn t want to put it out there is real wages have gone up under trump it s the first time it s happened i think in 40 years and we all know african american employment is up because president trump tells us every 10 minutes we all know other minorities and so the bottom is doing better the problem is the top the differential is getting even bigger and even though it s one of the seven deadly sins one of the most powerful human emotions is envy so the narrative about inequality is correct but one piece of the story is left out is that everybody is doing better unfortunately the people that are really accelerating so i don t believe the way to solve this is let s just ruin everything and then everybody will be worse off for it robert frank right but the inverse of that which is what the conservatives say well growth will solve everything in fact during high growth periods inequality increases so it doesn t solve inequality i am shocked though that you re saying you would support a higher capital gains rate you re a guy that i would guess makes a large share of your income from capital gains right stanley f druckenmiller i wish i m too short term but i have had substantial capital gains but it s no robert frank so has that changed for you was there a time when you wouldn t have but now stanley f druckenmiller i ve never been big on robert frank what should the rate be what do you think is a fair rate for it should it be taxed the same as income 37 there was a time when they were the same stanley f druckenmiller i wouldn t have a problem with that but then don t tell me you re going to raise the 37 to 50 and it s going up on both of them robert frank right stanley f druckenmiller okay as far as i m concerned they didn t do tax reform okay we did some tax reform in 86 this wasn t tax reform if anything the thing became even more complicated but i would have no problem with normalizing capital gains i hope i m not wrong because i could be to me you don t want to raise any taxes unless you re going to raise revenue i don t want to raise capital gains taxes because i want to hurt somebody joe kernen do you think the marginal rate is at the right level right now stanley f druckenmiller i don t know i m a laffer curve guy i don t know where we are you know we know it s between zero and a hundred i don t know which it is joe kernen but would you do we need to that you ve mentioned seventy cents of every dollar i mean that s a problem is it not stanley f druckenmiller what s seventy cents robert frank who is paying stanley f druckenmiller oh the entitlements joe kernen the entitlements i mean if we do anything with increased revenue i mean spending should still probably be cut and we need to address entitlements stanley f druckenmiller we don t even need to cut entitlement spending we just need to slow them down or make them grow at zero and all our problems go away joe kernen it s not exactly stanley f druckenmiller they all went up over five or six percent last year what nominal gdp growth less than that they re still gaining and by the way we haven t even gotten into the really demographic the gray boom spot i talked about twelve years ago if you remember i m sure you don t i thought the real consequences won t screw up until 2025 2030 i said this in 2012 well it s not 2025 yet but we re getting there stanley f druckenmiller on minimum wage and charter schools becky quick let s talk minimum wage and much more with our special guest today stanley f druckenmiller who is the ceo of duquesne family office stan you saw what bernie had to say you were watching this week as it was coming out and you sent us an email because i got you a little fired up what do you think about it stanley f druckenmiller well first of all on the minimum wage we just had a discussion about innovation we didn t we didn t go into the cloud and to me the choice is it s not minimum wage versus a wage it s minimum wage versus no wage and if you want to hurt workers with what s going on with the alternatives with technology jack the minimum wage up enough and you ll have job losses as a result so it doesn t make a lot of sense to me but the thing that really enraged me that comrade sanders said was his comment about charter schools i ve spent the better part of my life one of the great joys of my life was meeting geoff canada it s funny i was talking to fiona last night to have met geoff geoff canada and ken langone and have them both in my life for over 30 years i mean what a privilege and what luck but getting back on topic when he says he s against charter schools i know the man just doesn t care about inequality all he cares about power because that is disruptive to the african american community who prefers this and the only way you get out of inequality is with education at the early level and giving everybody on this in this country a shot and believe me this myth about pulling up your bootstraps and you know i m going to make it that s fine for ninety ninety five percent of the population but there are communities out there where these kids have no shot because the public schools are just so terrible they re never going to be able to compete in our economy and for sanders i assume he s in the pocket of the teacher s unions i don t know why said it but how in the world can you be against charter schools if you re serious about the inequality issue becky quick and we should tell people about the work you ve done in harlem how long have you been there stanley f druckenmiller well i ve been there i met geoff in 1993 but it s geoff s work it s not mine but we re serving 13 000 kids and 25 000 families in a hundred blocks of central harlem we ve moved the needle on every single metric and becky if you just even drive up there and i showed you pictures of 25 years ago you won t even believe what s out in the community our biggest problem is gentrification which is a high class problem relative what we re looking at and what s really cool is the harlem children s zone model which by the way geoffrey and anne not me is being replicated in communities all over the country obama s promise neighborhoods started it so we re not just affecting like 13 000 kids up there now it s becoming a nationwide thing and i think it s one of the answers one to the whole to the whole inequality issue so it s very exciting becky quick when you see hundreds of millions of dollars poured into a system like the newark school system without really decent results to show for any of that what do you think stanley f druckenmiller it broke my heart but you know i hate to say it because i know i know you re going to have viewers who passionately disagree but i m just not a believer in government being the most effective actor and this whole tax debate is interesting because i understand i really do understand why people want higher taxes and they think that s the solution inequality but you also need to understand i d much much rather have a jeff canada implementing programs and use his talents through private sector donors and donors that hold his organization accountable rather than letting the government becky quick just to be clear you think that s a solution for the five percent of communities where you re not getting decent public schools correct you don t think that this is something i mean i m a product of the public schools for most of my life my mom was a public schoolteacher my kids are in the public schools stanley f druckenmiller we re in the public schools in harlem we re not one of the big myths perceptions about harlem children s zone is we re a charter school network a that s a small piece of what we do up there we have baby college we have pre k we have employment and technology centers you know basically from cradle to college we re all over these kids and all over the process but we deeply deeply believe in public schools so that s not that s not what i m talking about here i m just saying that there are kids that need a shot and it cannot be done just through charter schools and by the way if they re charter schools that are not performing they should be shut down stanley f druckenmiller on job numbers becky quick are jobs numbers important today stanley f druckenmiller i think they re very important there s a technical thing when you have five weeks in may that could bias the number upward the seasonal adjustment they re important only because they affect the fed i don t use the job numbers to predict the economy it s just unbelievable the obsession with a lagging indicator i use them for entry and exit points to fade but i think if the job number is weak given everything else they re saying the fed will be on a clearer easing path by july
china may bank lending seen up more stimulus expected as trade war risks rise reuters poll new bank loans in china likely picked up modestly in may after slowing the previous month as the central bank tries to spur faster credit growth in the wake of a sharp escalation in the u s sino trade war contrary to market expectations china s economy has yet to bottom out despite a flurry of stimulus measures since last year and beijing is expected to ease policy further in coming months to bolster business confidence chinese banks are expected to have extended 1 225 trillion yuan 139 7 billion in net new yuan loans in may up from 1 02 trillion yuan in april and above 1 15 trillion yuan in the same month last year a median estimate in a reuters survey of 20 economists showed frustrated by a lack of progress in trade talks with china u s president donald trump raised tariffs last month on 200 billion worth of chinese goods and threatened to slap tariffs of up to 25 on another 300 billion of chinese imports prompting beijing to retaliate the international monetary fund imf on wednesday cut its 2019 economic growth forecast for china to 6 2 on heightened uncertainty around trade frictions saying that more monetary policy easing would be warranted if the trade war intensifies earlier last month the people s bank of china pboc announced a cut in three phases in the reserve requirement ratio for regional banks in a further bid to reduce small companies financing costs the pboc has now delivered six rrr cuts since early 2018 lowering the ratio to 13 5 percent for big banks and 11 5 percent for small to medium sized lenders outstanding yuan loan growth on a year on year basis likely held steady at 13 5 from april and broad m2 money supply was seen rising fractionally to 8 6 on year from 8 5 in april the poll showed tsf a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy was estimated to have picked up to 1 41 trillion yuan in may from 1 36 trillion in the previous month tsf includes off balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system such as initial public offerings loans from trust companies and bond sales opening the taps the central bank injected the most cash into the banking system in four months at the end of may to stabilise nervous money markets after the government seized control of troubled regional lender baoshang bank the first state takeover of a bank in two decades the pboc sought to calm investors by saying baoshang was an standalone case but the move added to worries about rising bad debt and systemic financial risks as washington ramps up trade pressure and the economic downturn wears on corporate bond defaults in china are on track for another record year bank of america merrill lynch analysts said on tuesday they expect the u s and chinese central banks to cut domestic interest rates in coming months as the economic fallout from the trade war grows they projected the federal reserve would cut key u s borrowing costs by 75 basis points by early 2020 beginning in september giving room for the pboc to lower rates twice later in 2019 and once in 2020 with less risk of triggering capital outflows factory activity in may contracted more than expected in the face of weaker demand at home and abroad an official survey showed last week adding urgency for more support measures analysts said while the pboc has guided interest rates lower over the past year through various means many analysts believe it has less room to loosen policy after it cut rrrs and interest rates aggressively in past downturns more forceful easing measures and a sharp jump in liquidity would add to debt risks and put more pressure on the yuan currency which fell than 2 5 against the dollar in may amid the unexpected deterioration in trade negotiations source reuters reporting by lusha zhang and beijing monitoring desk editing by kim coghill
the revival of heartland america from 2007 the greatest real estate deal in man s recorded history was the sell off of the louisiana purchase by the u s government beginning after the war of 1812 ended in 1815 when the mississippi river s outlet into the gulf through new orleans was assured for about 1 25 per acre immigrants could buy land they did not even have to pay cash most of this land was fertile transportation costs were low and then got lower the mississippi river the great lakes the erie canal and finally the most revolutionary invention of the nineteenth century the steam railroad converted 800 000 square miles of raw land into high value mostly family owned capital jefferson thought it would take centuries to fill the american heartland it took less than a century politically this shift was reflected in the substitution of ohio for virginia as the home state of presidents what had been the old northwest in 1787 became the center of the country by 1887 nevertheless new york city s financial dominance and new england s educational dominance produced a coastal view of america the communications system the roadways and the movies added california to the east coast s cultural dominance yet the accent of california remains the ohio accent this is also true of the movies and television with the steady decline of the number of people employed in manufacturing after 1950 the midwest lost its economic clout this decline included the political clout of the industrial trade unions the steel belt became the rust belt the heartland lost the best and the brightest to the coasts this was a crucial factor in the comparative decline of the region brains moved east or west where there seemed to be greater opportunities today this process has begun to reverse the establishment media being coastal have ignored it meanwhile the south has become integrated economically into the heartland air conditioning and the low political power of trade unions in the south combined to make the region acceptable to entrepreneurial immigrants from above the mason dixon line then came national retail chains after 1970 you cannot tell where you are on main street anywhere in the country they all look alike america s homogenized culture has overwhelmed every region this has reduced the culture shock of a move into or out of a region one major barrier remains the cost of real estate as in 1850 heartland america has the edge the lowest cost prime real estate on earth where opportunity lies prime urban real estate around the world is now beyond the reach of the next generation of home owners government subsidies to the real estate market in the form of loan guarantees and central bank inflation have combined to create demand for urban real estate in the world s largest cities anything that we would regard as comfortable middle class living can no longer be purchased by members of the middle class who do not already own real estate to sell to first time buyers the heartland is not where most people have preferred to live cold weather and a more traditional lifestyle for eight decades failed to attract the best and the brightest the up and coming urban professionals moved to the coasts the coastal regions filled up with opportunity seekers they bid up the price of real estate after 1960 today their grandchildren are locked out of the housing markets the u s government responded politically to that age old desire to own your own home the government subsidized the creation of low down payment mortgages this enabled home buyers after 1950 to lock in 30 year mortgages which they paid off now they are selling to late comers the effect on housing prices of government insured lending institutions that issue mortgages is analogous to the effect of medicare on health care prices upward first time buyers are becoming debtors to the tune of 500 000 to 700 000 in places like boston and southern california they are locked into 30 year mortgages for the rest of their lives they will pay 40 of their after tax income to buy their homes family by family their children will either move out of the region or else find themselves strapped with lifelong debt forced to live on dual incomes for the rest of their lives this is good news for entrepreneurs who own profit seeking day cares for everyone else it isn t whenever there is a recession thousands of these debt burdened home owners will be forced to abandon their homes their credit ratings will suffer they may be in debt for 100 000 or more after their homes are sold out from under them in a foreclosure bankruptcy will become their only option my son scott recently moved to southern california he and two others rent a 3 bedroom townhouse for 2 100 month he tells me that because of the high price of owning a home rentals stay on the market for only a few hours you need to call to rent as soon as you see an ad newcomers in his age bracket under age 30 who don t earn 60 000 a year are locked out of home ownership this makes the two income family a necessity in most cases the single income family is a thing of the past in the housing bubble regions my daughter bought a 2100 square foot house in nashville for about 170 000 it has a decent sized back yard in a comparable neighborhood in southern california that house would sell for close to 700 000 the difference in price is not based on regional income levels people in nashville don t earn a third to a quarter of what people in southern california do the difference has to do with the concentration of population people are paying heavily for weather and lifestyle but the warm weather and lifestyle are now overwhelmingly based on massive lifetime debt high taxes and extensive government regulation in california and new york and massachusetts are steadily reducing the level of economic opportunity nevada is booming an escape hatch from the tightening grip of government across the border no income tax new hampshire serves the same function for people who want to escape the people s republic of massachusetts no income tax no sales tax we know from the real estate mania on the coasts that with respect to property values there is a lot of upward potential in the heartland people are willing to indebt themselves in every region no longer is the old 25 of income rule operational yet heartland real estate is still obtainable by honoring the old rule the difference is the decentralization of population in the heartland the distribution of population is much greater the price of land has not been bid up to such a degree now telecommunications are allowing residents of the heartland to make incomes comparable to those on the coasts this is creating economic opportunities for young families women can work at home husbands can earn higher salaries entrepreneurs can hire well educated locals and recent immigrants from the coasts what took place in austin texas from 1985 to 1995 is indicative of what can happen in a decade from an oil economy bust to a digital economy boom the upward pressure of population is relentless there are over 300 000 000 people in the united states this will go to 400 000 000 by 2050 if these newcomers want to own their own homes they will have to find less expensive places to live in texas rather than california or phoenix young families will move inland young people want to own their homes this is not going to change anytime soon they will move to regions where they can afford to buy a home they have been doing this since approximately 1640 as american families grew smaller after 1957 the links to existing regions grew weaker for a century people moved to southern california just as they had moved to new york city their children did not move away from the parents and siblings but now they must leave family behind if they want to own their own homes the price of entry level housing in southern california is now limited to hispanics who are willing to put more than the immediate family into the same home and share mortgage costs and to highly successful two income families especially asians if you don t understand this spend ten minutes on www realtor com look up any zip code in southern california start with anaheim 92802 it was mostly orange trees in 1950 then came disneyland begin with homes in the 400 000 range check the square footage one of the most astute commentators on this major demographic shift is joel kotkin in a recent article in the american interest titled little start up on the prairie he describes aurora nebraska population 4 500 with its neat town square and red brick civic buildings it suggests a reflection of america s bucolic past yet it may also represent an oblique looking glass glimpse into america s future in the first half of the 21st century as the nation grows from 300 toward 400 million people aurora and other places in the american heartland will provide a critical outlet for the restless energies and entrepreneurial passions of its people as i read it i thought of the article written by america s most detail conscious social observer tom wolfe he wrote on the origin of silicon valley the pioneer was robert noyce of intel who grew up in grinnell iowa noyce brought the protestant ethic of his youth and his college years to silicon valley when they were in their teens noyce and his brothers made their pocket money by mowing lawns raking leaves and babysitting in grinnell that was socially correct behavior to have devoted the same time to taking tennis golf or riding lessons would have been regarded as a gaffe of the genus conspicuous indolence there was no country club set in grinnell or anything approaching one wolfe s main point was that in the midwest engineering was respected this was not the case back east where pure science and the humanities were fashionable this was an aspect of european snobbery wolfe said as a result the way to today s information superhighway more recently known as the digital revolution was paved entirely by geniuses from the midwest and farther west the inventor of the lightbulb which started it all was thomas edison from port huron michigan the inventor of the vacuum tube which made possible the development of the high speed electronic computer was lee de forest from council bluffs iowa the three engineers at bell laboratories who won nobel prizes for inventing the transistor which replaced the vacuum tube were john bardeen from madison wisconsin walter brattain from seattle washington and william shockley from palo alto california the chief of the fabled bell labs in those palmy days was oliver buckley from sloane iowa the two inventors of the integrated circuit or microchip the very heart of the revolution were first jack kilby from jefferson city missouri whose chip was made of germanium and six months later noyce whose chip was made of silicon and became the standard for the industry and gave the silicon valley its name wolfe is wise enough to know that asians are pioneers in engineering in silicon valley they are from way back east whose outlook is more iowa than massachusetts but the cultural atmosphere created by noyce and his team made their entry into the ranks of the creative engineers far easier the brains moved to the coasts especially california after world war ii this process is now reversing according to kotkin low electrical costs access to interstate 80 to omaha and lincoln and excellent high speed telecommunications make aurora a desirable location for several growing businesses so too does a reliable literate and highly trainable workforce unemployment barely exists and the biggest problem as in many other places in the heartland is finding new workers the establishment media do not perceive what is happening kotkin says this is not surprising the establishment media are coastal most media coverage portrays a kind of mad max environment a desiccated postmodern lost world of emptying towns meth labs and militant native americans typical was a 2006 new york times article describing north dakota as not far from forsaken its imagery was of irresistible decline dying towns aging populations a place for the curious easterner to visit now before it all blows away if there is anything positive according to such accounts it lies in the hope that much of the country between the mississippi and the rockies might end up as a giant enviro playground subsidized by environmentalists like ted turner this image is mostly bunk according to kotkin restoring the natural environment where possible is no doubt a good thing but many places in this vast swath of the country also are rebounding in terms of jobs population and income in many cases more so than parts of urban coastal america fargo north dakota for example grew by more than 20 percent between 1990 and 2000 scores of other heartland towns and cities sioux falls des moines and bismarck among others have seen similar expansions he calls this micropolitan growth it is where most of the growth is nationally this is reasonable anything large reaches its limits to growth the rate of growth slows indeed as we look at the fastest job growth in the country micropolitan areas are fairly dominant of the 393 fastest growing regions in the country fifteen of the top twenty were micropolitan areas while only one the sprawling city of las vegas ranked among the fastest job growing metros in the country beginning in the 1970s migration reversed this has received little attention this has accelerated since 1990 a decade ago fargo was a classic backwater and after the release of the eponymous movie something of a national joke a critical shift occurred in the late 1980s when doug burgum a local boy from nearby arthur moved back home from chicago to join a fledgling local start up called great plains software burgum recognized the area s considerable engineering expertise both from north dakota state university and a large and expanding specialty farm equipment industry and he anticipated growth the success of great plains software sparked other start ups in fields ranging from biotechnology to wireless networking to radio frequency identification systems today extrapolating from recent national science foundation data north dakota has one of the highest rates of high tech startups in the nation with the fargo area as the undisputed epicenter the area is also luring businesses from the coasts a big part of this shift has to do with lifestyle what i decided in 1959 when i left manhattan beach california what was to become the consummate epicenter of southern california s real estate boom shaking the sand off my feet is now becoming widespread i wanted out of that lifestyle so even in the new hipper fargo the real driver of success remains a set of values self reliance community spirit a dedication to family and faith that have long been at the center of the heartland ethos after all along with its finer dining and hip bars fargo has a microscopic crime rate compared to any major coastal city and little in the way of an underclass as in aurora local charities thrive and community involvement is the norm these characteristics are the main draw particularly to relocating thirty somethings notes mike chambers founder of the fast growing biotech firm aldevron it s an experience common to many companies in this buckle of the brain belt wherever you go you find people who went out and came back says howard dahl ceo of fargo based amity technologies a fast growing agricultural machinery firm and former head of the local arts council we constantly get resumes from people at boeing in seattle or somewhere else they don t come for the mountains or the sunshine or the culture they come back because of the kind of people who are here this shift has religious overtones and implications americans are leaving the do your own thing morally in exchange for do more of your own thing entrepreneurially dahl a former lutheran seminarian says religion also plays a major role but not in the loud assertive tones one might find in houston or dallas religion and family play a huge role in everything but it s quiet it s people s sense of ethics he suggests it s that you care about your community and can count on your neighbors what robert nisbet identified as the quest for community back in 1953 is still in process such values aurora s gary allen believes are the real secret behind the nascent heartland resurgence in a town of barely 4 500 there are more than thirty non profit foundations with assets in excess of 45 million it is all part notes gary warren of a community spirit reflected in the city s extensive recreation facilities its well maintained central square library senior center and museum community building is a way of life here warren offers you give to your community the way you give to your church on sunday it s the essence of what it is to live here and it s why people decide they want to come here conclusion for young families the heartland once again offers opportunity the weather will not get any better but technology can overcome the worst aspects of weather air conditioning in the heartland south and heating oil in the heartland north i have preferred the south to the north fuel costs may reinforce this preference over the next few decades for retirees the heartland is better people move to asheville north carolina not to los angeles to retire for start up entrepreneurs the heartland is better locate a university with a good engineering department and move there college station texas gets my good entrepreneurship seal of approval so does auburn alabama for young families that don t want to spend their lives as mortgage serfs the heartland is better the south will rise again it just won t be the south the south is gone with the wind if you think i m wrong let me know the next time you see an all white backfield at the university of alabama __________________________ originally published on february 20 2007 the original is

file photo the flags of china u s and the chinese communist party are displayed in a flag stall at the yiwu wholesale market in yiwu by dhara ranasinghe london reuters after almost three years of successfully predicting a global economic revival world bond markets are furiously flagging the risk of yet another recession as well as low inflation for a generation spooked by the escalating u s china trade war long term interest rates embedded in government bond markets widely seen as the most accurate predictors of future economic activity and inflation have relapsed into deep troughs u s treasury yields have plunged 50 basis points in seven weeks while sub zero german 10 year bond yields are at record lows in japan britain switzerland and france borrowing costs are at their lowest since 2016 when financial markets were hit by a combination of blows including britain s shock decision to leave the european union and an economic slowdown in china recession is not a given bond markets may be pointing that way but some other indicators such as equity markets are not as bearish however trade tensions also including a recent u s plan to impose tariffs on mexico may be what s making the present slide in bond yields different we have to pay attention said franck dixmier global head of fixed income for allianz global which manages more than 560 billion in assets we know from experience that bond markets are quite good at predicting future economic developments and what s being priced in more and more is the consequence of a clear escalation of trade tensions expectations for future inflation globally have tumbled as a result of fears about slowing growth or recession at a time when major central banks have limited ammunition following years of ultra easy monetary policy britain is an exception because of brexit the most prominent bearish signal for economic growth is coming from the u s bond curve where the 3 month 10 year yield curve is near its most inverted since 2007 the months leading up to the global financial crisis an inverted curve where long dated yields are below short dated ones has proved a powerful recessionary indicator in a strong sign that markets are bracing for rate cuts most of the u s curve is below the target range for the federal funds rate of 2 25 2 50 short term interest rate futures imply the u s federal reserve could start cutting rates as soon as next month the yield curve is still a very good indicator because when you look at the curve and the correlation between this and macro economic variables this hasn t changed for 20 years said pictet asset management chief strategist luca paolini adding that a recession but not a deep one was likely graphic share of negative yielding debt graphic most u s yields fall below fed s target range graphic euro zone inflation expectations hit record low trust me but reading the bond market tea leaves is not easy the predictive power of the u s bond curve has been hurt by the prolonged easy monetary policy and demand for bonds from institutional investors such as pension and insurance funds that s played a part in suppressing long dated yields making it easier for the curve to invert u s unemployment has always risen before recessions but is currently near 50 year lows equities are holding up well as are the riskier sections of the corporate bond market economic data too while disappointing has not been dire in the united states the institute for supply management s ism manufacturing activity index is at its lowest level since 2016 but above the 50 mark consistent with expansion bluebay asset management s chief investment officer mark dowding notes that in 2016 when fears about weak global growth and inflation last gripped markets the ism plunged to 48 and oil prices slumped to around 30 now oil prices while at 4 month lows are double the levels three years ago trade war weak economy but the deep trade tensions at play today could make this situation different according to analysts and investors u s two year treasury yields last week notched up their biggest weekly fall since 2009 just as u s president donald trump vowed to impose tariffs on mexico while markets had until last month broadly expected a constructive outcome neil mackinnon global macro strategist at vtb capital said that now investors see the dispute as part of a larger more complex long term hegemonic battle and for markets that is more dangerous and uncertain investment banks have changed their views on growth and central bank policy morgan stanley now projects global growth will stagnate at current levels for the rest of 2019 jpmorgan expects two u s rate cuts this year and goldman sachs says its downside risk scenario for german bund yields is 50 basis points versus the current 0 25 bps the international monetary fund meanwhile cut its world growth forecasts this week and germany s central bank also slashed predictions for the country s economy expecting it grow this year by just 0 6 some central banks have moved to easing mode already new zealand australia and india have cut rates and even fed officials have raised that possibility against that backdrop of rate cut bets we have to ask is that consistent with investors thinking the fed is fine tuning policy or is there a fundamental economic backdrop that s far worse than we had thought said sunil krishnan head of multi asset funds at aviva investors some of the buying interest in treasuries is taking the more pessimistic view european central bank chief mario draghi this week sought to reassure investors the bank was ready to act if needed even holding out the prospect of more rate cuts or resuming bond buying stimulus nervous investors plowed a record 12 3 billion into higher quality investment grade bonds in the week to wednesday bank of america merrill lynch said and the pool of negative yielding bonds globally has swelled to over 10 trillion banks estimate absent inflation for central banks especially the ecb perhaps the most worrying bond market signal is that inflation will remain below target for years market pricing of inflation expectations in the euro area suggest inflation could remain below target for at least two decades a key market gauge of euro area inflation expectations is at record lows below 1 25 the ecb targets an inflation rate of just below 2 but it has undershot this since 2013 and that s after unprecedented stimulus it seems to be very difficult to see inflation going above target on a 5 10 year view said bluebay s dowding and even if trade tensions and with it global recession fears ebb other uncertainties brexit italy s budget clash with the eu suggest bonds will hold their cachet for some time said dixmier at allianz

source xinhua 2019 06 07 16 50 58 editor xuxin video player close by matthew rusling washington june 6 xinhua the united states continued talks with mexico on thursday amid u s president donald trump s threats to slap tariffs on its southern neighbor if tariffs take effect that could impact both economies and drive a wedge between washington and its third largest trading partner experts said at issue is whether mexico will step up efforts to stop the flow of undocumented migrants crossing its southern border into the united states trump has expressed frustration over growing inflow of illegal immigrants last month saw a decade long high in apprehensions of illegal migrants with 133 000 detained at the border mexico is also used as a route of entry to the united states by violent criminal gangs from el salvador such as the infamous ms 13 while many of trump s supporters also believe that illegal immigration drives down working class wages and increases competition for blue collar jobs illegal immigration will be one of trump s major platforms in the 2020 elections and the president believes mexico has done very little to mitigate the situation while mexico on thursday vowed to provide 6 000 troops to beef up border security that may not be enough to satisfy trump s demands the u s president has threatened that if mexico does not take action to stem the tsunami of illegal migration he will slap a 5 percent tariff on mexican goods that will grow incrementally if no agreement is reached late thursday afternoon white house press secretary sarah sanders said the u s position has not changed and we are still moving forward with tariffs at this time trump is using mexico to highlight the issue of illegal immigration and why there needs to be stronger action taking to reduce it brookings institution senior fellow darrell west told xinhua he blames mexico because many central american asylum seekers go through mexico on their way to the united states west said tori k whiting an economist specializing in trade at the heritage foundation told xinhua the president s strategy is to coerce mexico into cooperating more on immigration but he noted that the tariffs will harm americans republicans disagree while republicans support trump on most issues some gop lawmakers have parted with the president on the issue of tariffs on mexico senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said tuesday that there is not much support in my conference for tariffs that s for sure however while mcconnell is seeking to delay the tariffs it remains unknown whether there is enough gop opposition to push back trump s move has sparked a backlash among a number of republican legislators who oppose the use of tariffs and fear it will open another trade war south of the border west said outdated laws tv news personality and republican strategist ford o connell told xinhua the main problem is that u s laws do not reflect the reality on the ground the vast majority of illegal migrants are from guatemala el salvador and honduras many are traveling as families or claiming to be families the laws are designed to stop single men from mexico rather than families or children migrating alone laws make it difficult to detain such individuals even if they are lying about being under the age of 18 authorities often have no choice other than to release them into the united states where they remain indefinitely thanks so american laws the people who come here illegally the majority will never be deported o connell told xinhua if people don t ever think they are going to be turned away why would they ever stop coming o connell said economic impact dan mahaffee senior vice president and director of policy at the center for the study of congress and the presidency told xinhua that tariffs will likely have a severe economic impact for industries that have supply chains spanning the border especially in the auto industry according to whiting the u s stock market has already taken a hit on the tariffs which could increase prices on everything from avocados to car parts desmond lachman a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute said the situation has already had a negative impact on the mexican peso and on mexican investor confidence it has also spooked global financial markets as it sends negative signals about the trump administration s intentions about resolving the u s china trade dispute if we go down the escalating mexican tariff path things could get worse for the mexican and global economies lachman said despite tariff jitters markets surged wednesday and thursday after federal reserve chairman jerome powell signaled that the fed would lower interest rates to offset any damage done by trade wars many stock market researchers remain optimistic about u s markets for the rest of the year although they hope deals are struck with both mexico and china experts said the tariffs could endanger the passage of the u s mexico canada agreement usmca a proposed replacement for the north american free trade agreement nafta trump s move likely will imperil passage of the new trade agreement with mexico because democrats already have major doubts about it and republicans won t be as supportive if tariffs are imposed west said lachman echoed those thoughts saying tariffs could undermine congressional support for usmca especially if mexico were to retaliate in a way that hit some republican congressmen s constituencies
usd jpy has stabilized as the fed opened the door to cutting rates amid raging trade wars the upcoming week focuses on the us consumer but traders should watch politics as well the technical outlook for the second week of june remains bearish the fx poll shows a bearish bias in the short term and a bullish one afterward what just happened fed opens the door to a cut the us sino trade war has been intensifying once again china has held its ground saying it will not give up issuing a travel warning regarding visits to the us and making preparations to limit exports of rare earth the us has made preparations to import such products from other countries blaming china for the failure of the talks and more president donald trump has continued criticizing mexico for allowing migrants despite his southern neighbor s pledge to do more at the time of writing the us plans to slap mexico with a 5 tariff on all goods on monday after talks in washington have failed to yield an agreement the old new trade front has implications beyond us mexican relations and has also weighed on markets the high tensions lasting for a month have finally shifted the federal reserve s thinking james bullard president of the federal reserve branch of saint louis has been the first to suggest the fed should cut interest rates and do it soon fed chair jerome powell followed by saying that the central bank is worried about trade uncertainty and will act as appropriate moving away from the patient policy on rates and raising speculation of the fed slashing prices markets are currently pricing in two rate cuts this year with weak data also contributing to the worries the ism manufacturing purchasing managers index points to a slowdown in the sector that is dear to trump the services sector is doing better with the ism beating expectations with 56 9 points the adp non farm payrolls has shown an increase of only 27k private sector jobs the worst since march 2010 the official non farm payrolls were the final blow to the greenback the us economy gained a meager 75k jobs in may and revisions reduced 75k off the numbers for march and april moreover wages rose by only 0 2 against 0 3 on a monthly basis and 3 1 year on year a deceleration from 3 2 the mix of escalating trade wars and mostly weak data has pushed usd jpy lower however as it becomes clear that the fed is ready to act the mood of

governor yi gang at the g 20 gathering of finance ministers and central bankers the first high level meeting since talks broke down in early may the mnuchin gang encounter and perhaps tweets from president trump may set the tone for markets at the wake of the new week as echoes from the nfp fade away if the us moves forward with imposing duties on mexico a move that some doubt that will happen the markets are set to fall dragging usd jpy down while 5 is negligible hitting mexico after signing a trade deal would serve as a warning to china and to the others that the us cannot be trusted it would also send a message that trump is keen on fighting rather than winning tuesday s producer prices are of interest and may serve as a warm up towards wednesday s all important inflation data prices have accelerated in april with the consumer price index cpi hitting 2 year on year and critical core cpi rising to 2 1 providing some relief for the fed any change in core prices will be closely watched and may tilt the final decision of the central bank in the following week the consumer comes into play on thursday retail sales have disappointed by falling by 0 2 on the headline and remaining flat on the critical control group economists forecast better data for may with a substantial increase consumption is key to the us economy and has a major contribution to gdp the fed is watching this figure very closely the last word of the week also belongs to the american shopper the university of michigan releases its first estimate of consumer sentiment for june and it may show a

remains capped by the downtrend resistance line momentum is to the downside and the pair trades below the 50 100 and 200 simple moving averages on the daily chart below the late january low of 108 50 support awaits at 108 00 which was a low point in january and also in early june it is closely followed by another trough from the same time at 107 80 and finally by 107 50 which is where the pair stabilized after flash crashing to 104 76 at the wake of 2019 upside resistance awaits at the round number of 109 00 which supported usd jpy in early may further up 1089 90 was a swing high later last

hard to see any reasons for usd jpy to recover signs of a global slowdown intensifying trade tensions and willingness from the fed to cut interest rates all point to the downside the fxstreet poll shows a bearish bias in the short term but a bullish one afterward despite the bullish stance in the medium and long terms the targets have been substantially downgraded experts may be foreseeing a prolonged trade war related forecasts
the synchronised global economic expansion cheered on by investors who pushed wall street stocks to a record high last month has started to sour and is increasingly at risk from a developing trade war between the world s two largest economies a group of several hundred economists and financial market professionals regularly polled by reuters over the past few years has consistently and almost unanimously warned that trade conflict is the number one global economic risk advertisement central bankers and finance ministers from the g20 countries will have this to contemplate as they meet over the weekend in fukuoka japan under the long shadow of the america first policy pursued by their still dominant member as the u s china trade war has dragged on and evidence piles up that trade volumes are taking a knock those warnings seem all the more prescient federal reserve chair jerome powell appears to have come round to a similar view advertisement if market bets are even remotely correct the fed which just months ago looked set to hike interest rates several times this year may be only months away from following several other important world central banks like australia s and new zealand s in cutting rates j p morgan one of the largest u s banks is already forecasting two fed rate cuts this year but is casting that essentially as a successful insurance policy with very modest changes to their outlook for global growth next year advertisement for her part christine lagarde head of the international monetary fund told reuters recently that the u s china trade war will not cause a global recession but that the trade spat amounted to self inflicted wounds the problem is it s ongoing and until it stops there is no way to accurately forecast what will happen next nor can one really predict what goes on in the minds of the world s company executives with respect to future investment decisions citi economists are among those who have tried and what they foresaw was not pretty advertisement recent developments remain consistent with our long held view that trade tensions have not peaked and are expected to continue with and beyond china wrote citi economist cesar rojas in a client note amid a relative balance between domestic resilience and external headwinds a metastasized global trade war would likely trigger a cascade of economic and financial reactions that would tip the global economy into a growth recession he wrote make no mistake the united states which has easily outperformed its peers is still growing reasonably strongly with the latest read on its vast non manufacturing industries which make up the bulk of production topping expectations advertisement but private sector economists most of whom are still chastised by the market for missing the last u s recession see a significant 40 percent chance of a slump in the next two years even the mighty u s dollar is catching a whiff of it on a shorter time horizon past experience shows once a recession probability gets consistently that high in economists minds which are tempered by other things like what s good for business there is a good chance it has already started advertisement policymakers of course can ease their language and cut interest rates but they rarely forecast economic slumps doing so is counterproductive in setting policy aimed at supporting economies one of their unwritten roles is to cheerlead their main role in most cases is to manage inflation yet apart from rampant asset price inflation in the decade since the great recession and a sprinkling of wage inflation as the u s jobless rate plumbs half century lows there has been acceleration in little else advertisement that last point was underscored at the european central bank s news conference on thursday where it again extended its view on how long rates are likely to remain unchanged to mid 2020 inflation expectations have dropped sharply for the u s the euro zone and britain since late last year and consensus forecasts remain below central banks targets for this year and next over the past few months the inflation outlook has been cut with lower lows over the forecast horizon that is all the more remarkable given that in most cases rates in the developed world barely reached what would have been described as neutral neither stimulative nor restrictive before the last financial crisis advertisement even the reserve bank of india managing one of the fastest growing economies in the world just delivered a third successive interest rate cut can we chalk all of this up to central bank success in taming inflation or is it that inflation is being driven by global forces not under their control ecb president mario draghi pointed out on thursday several factors damaging economic sentiment that he can t control including geopolitical uncertainty and of course the rising threat of protectionism
file photo a u s border patrol agent stands in front of the border fence that divides the u s and mexico in san diego california the united states nov 17 2018 xinhua zhao hanrong by matthew rusling washington june 6 xinhua the united states continued talks with mexico on thursday amid u s president donald trump s threats to slap tariffs on its southern neighbor if tariffs take effect that could impact both economies and drive a wedge between washington and its third largest trading partner experts said at issue is whether mexico will step up efforts to stop the flow of undocumented migrants crossing its southern border into the united states trump has expressed frustration over growing inflow of illegal immigrants last month saw a decade long high in apprehensions of illegal migrants with 133 000 detained at the border mexico is also used as a route of entry to the united states by violent criminal gangs from el salvador such as the infamous ms 13 while many of trump s supporters also believe that illegal immigration drives down working class wages and increases competition for blue collar jobs illegal immigration will be one of trump s major platforms in the 2020 elections and the president believes mexico has done very little to mitigate the situation while mexico on thursday vowed to provide 6 000 troops to beef up border security that may not be enough to satisfy trump s demands the u s president has threatened that if mexico does not take action to stem the tsunami of illegal migration he will slap a 5 percent tariff on mexican goods that will grow incrementally if no agreement is reached late thursday afternoon white house press secretary sarah sanders said the u s position has not changed and we are still moving forward with tariffs at this time trump is using mexico to highlight the issue of illegal immigration and why there needs to be stronger action taking to reduce it brookings institution senior fellow darrell west told xinhua he blames mexico because many central american asylum seekers go through mexico on their way to the united states west said tori k whiting an economist specializing in trade at the heritage foundation told xinhua the president s strategy is to coerce mexico into cooperating more on immigration but he noted that the tariffs will harm americans republicans disagree while republicans support trump on most issues some gop lawmakers have parted with the president on the issue of tariffs on mexico senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said tuesday that there is not much support in my conference for tariffs that s for sure however while mcconnell is seeking to delay the tariffs it remains unknown whether there is enough gop opposition to push back trump s move has sparked a backlash among a number of republican legislators who oppose the use of tariffs and fear it will open another trade war south of the border west said outdated laws tv news personality and republican strategist ford o connell told xinhua the main problem is that u s laws do not reflect the reality on the ground the vast majority of illegal migrants are from guatemala el salvador and honduras many are traveling as families or claiming to be families the laws are designed to stop single men from mexico rather than families or children migrating alone laws make it difficult to detain such individuals even if they are lying about being under the age of 18 authorities often have no choice other than to release them into the united states where they remain indefinitely thanks so american laws the people who come here illegally the majority will never be deported o connell told xinhua if people don t ever think they are going to be turned away why would they ever stop coming o connell said economic impact dan mahaffee senior vice president and director of policy at the center for the study of congress and the presidency told xinhua that tariffs will likely have a severe economic impact for industries that have supply chains spanning the border especially in the auto industry according to whiting the u s stock market has already taken a hit on the tariffs which could increase prices on everything from avocados to car parts desmond lachman a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute said the situation has already had a negative impact on the mexican peso and on mexican investor confidence it has also spooked global financial markets as it sends negative signals about the trump administration s intentions about resolving the u s china trade dispute if we go down the escalating mexican tariff path things could get worse for the mexican and global economies lachman said despite tariff jitters markets surged wednesday and thursday after federal reserve chairman jerome powell signaled that the fed would lower interest rates to offset any damage done by trade wars many stock market researchers remain optimistic about u s markets for the rest of the year although they hope deals are struck with both mexico and china experts said the tariffs could endanger the passage of the u s mexico canada agreement usmca a proposed replacement for the north american free trade agreement nafta trump s move likely will imperil passage of the new trade agreement with mexico because democrats already have major doubts about it and republicans won t be as supportive if tariffs are imposed west said lachman echoed those thoughts saying tariffs could undermine congressional support for usmca especially if mexico were to retaliate in a way that hit some republican congressmen s constituencies

reports filed with the sec advertisement advertisement i would now like to turn the call over to carlos carlos alberini chief executive officer thank you operator good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today now that i have just passed the milestone of my first 100 days in this role i would like to comment on the progress that we have made since our last call last month we celebrated the 38th anniversary of guess with a wonderful global meeting in barcelona that we referred to as the one world one brand conference the first conference of this kind took place back in 2006 and this one was our eighth one we invited a large number of our associates from all over the world to the conference as well as our product licensees key joint venture partners franchisees another key global colleagues and partners the energy and ideas that were shared at the conference were truly inspiring while there were several important topics including the three day agenda customer centricity and brand relevancy were the main focus of the meeting the venue was the perfect one to share my strategic vision for the company which reads as follows at guess we are obsessed with our customers our customers represent multiple generations that are young sexy and adventures at heart we inspire our customers to express their true selves through the people they relate to the way they dress how they spend their free time the music they enjoy the places they visit the activities they engage in in essence we want to inspire them to express their true selves in the way they live their lives we believe in inclusivity and inspire individuality originality and authenticity advertisement advertisement building on its incredibly strong heritage and amazing global brand recognition guess will continue to be one of the coolest brands in the fashion industry leveraging celebrity partnerships and unique go to market strategies with a growing global business offering an incredible customer experience that includes amazing product inspired by the guess dna and lifestyle speed and flexibility omni channel capabilities and data driven personalized marketing our ultimate goal is to delight our highly desirable and loyal customers through the best global team of associates partners and licensees who work effectively together to achieve common goals delivering best in class profitability cash flow generation and shareholder value creation guess is a conscious catalyst organization that cares about environmentally responsible practices and a great work environment guess is a company that gives back to the world to make it a better place with a sharing of our vision statement with our entire team we officially launched our strategic planning cycle this year at the end of the conference key members of our executive team stayed on to kick off the process the team is already working hard to complete the project and as i committed to you during our last call we plan to come back to you with an update on it after the end of the summer in the meantime we continue to make solid progress on key projects that we have launched applying the key principles that i mentioned before to take advantage of value creation opportunities for our company let me start with capital allocation as we reviewed the value creation opportunity relative to our operating performance and our expected future cash flows it was clear to us that there is material incremental value in our company as we take actions to improve our operating performance these represent changes that are completely under our control and we plan to attack in the short to medium term for this reason we made a strategic decision to redeploy capital and return incremental value to our shareholders through significant share repurchases while reducing our dividend by 50 as you know our board approved a plan to raise 300 million in convertible debt which we executed during the quarter and the majority of the net proceeds have already been deployed or have been committed to repurchase stock we expect the impact from the convert transaction and share repurchases to be accretive to our adjusted eps this year by 0 10 per share we are really excited with the transaction as we achieved very favorable terms our interest coupon is 2 and we were able to buy a bond hedge and warrants to eliminate the economic dilution unless the stock price exceeds 47 with the shares repurchase so far and the completion of the asr we expect to buy about 17 of the shares that were outstanding at the beginning of the year and we believe the incremental value to shareholders over time will be very material advertisement advertisement at the same time we ll continue to prioritize our capital allocation toward investments that support growth and infrastructure based on their strategic significance and the return on invested capital expectations additionally we have already taken steps from an inventory management perspective to ensure that inventories are planned and managed in a very disciplined way the results of this actions are already materializing in our inventory forecasts for the remainder of the year second product development and distribution optimization as i mentioned last time we have a number of key product categories such as denim accessories marciano and men s that if better assorted and represented in stores and online can drive incremental sales for us for instance we have already implemented plans to increase capacity for our denim product in 219 of our stores globally for foreign holidays this includes 90 stores in the us we are also working on introducing additional fashion styles to provide more variety in the denim assortment our marketing campaign for the summer and full seasons will feature denim prominently to reclaim our dominance in the category in addition we now see significant opportunities to design and develop product for the key target customer groups and having the right product in the right place at the right time will become also a big priority this involves speed to market and the use of analytics and technology for the digitalization of the supply chain we have also reorganized our marciano team to address local customer preferences more effectively going forward we will operate with two design teams as we do with the guess line one team will be based in los angeles to serve the north america region and the other one in stabio switzerland to serve europe third global strategies i continue to believe that we have a tremendous opportunity to leverage and support our global business more effectively by reorganizing accountability and strengthening our infrastructure including the use of technology and data analytics in areas such as inventory management logistics and distribution sourcing and product development store site selection and product pricing and we are already evaluating options to invest in process improvement tools in all of these areas advertisement advertisement regarding functional accountabilities we are approaching several operational and support areas with a consistent global focus some examples of functions with global responsibilities are finance strategy it logistics sources and product development inventory management human resources and real estate fourth cost structure optimization there are definite areas of opportunities for significant cost savings and operating efficiencies in our company we have already engaged a consulting firm to study and assess our cost structure and identify opportunities in the americas and in europe i believe the results of this assessment will give us a roadmap for executing improvements to our operation and cost structure to drive incremental profitability and fifth customer centricity which as i have said in the past consists of placing the customer at the center of everything we do including perfecting the omni channel experience we have strong customer files in the americas europe and asia that provide a lot of insight into the customer s product purchase history and their behavioral shopping patterns by leveraging this data we ll be able to map the customer journey and through predictive analytics be able to personalize marketing effectively and delight the customers by delivering the product and experience that they are looking for we re also reassessing our current systems and tools to deliver a seamless omni channel shopping experience we plan to implement new technology to perfect our capabilities globally regarding our financial results for the first quarter we reported another quarter of strong revenue growth we reported a 3 increase in revenues 8 growth in constant currency during the period we increased gross margins by 50 basis points company wide and we managed expenses well our adjusted operating loss finished within the range of our guidance and our adjusted loss per share finished at the high end of our guidance our financial results this quarter represented strong performance in the americas and europe partially offset by weakness in asia advertisement advertisement let me quickly comment on the situation in asia it has become clear to us during the course of the first quarter that there has been a significant softening in the business and we see that in the form of lower traffic both through our stores and through our e commerce platforms including tmall where we sell our product on while in the short term this is painful for the business we still see very good long term potential in the region as we don t believe that the current issues will impair our ability to capitalize on that potential looking ahead i want to talk briefly about tariffs on imports from china and mexico into the us as others in the industry have been doing we are taking actions to mitigate the impact from the potential increase in tariffs this actions include cost sharing with our suppliers shifting sourcing to other countries of origin raising prices if the pricing still delivers the value in the product of our customer is looking for and offsetting this increased cost with other cost saving initiatives of course if the list 4 tariffs go to 25 the impact to us will be meaningful but the situation is still fluid and we will continue to accelerate the mitigation actions as the situation evolves before i conclude over the last three months i have spent considerable time reflecting on my role at guess and on all the opportunities that i see for our company today i want to share with you how excited i am about my job and our company s opportunity to execute on the vision that i shared with you earlier i will focus on four big points that make this opportunity extraordinary first brand relevancy and attracting a new younger customer i strongly believe that the guess brand continues to gain relevancy in today s retail marketplace on a global level our celebrity partnerships and collaborations continue to draw significant customer interest into our brands attracting not only our traditional guess customer which we call our heritage customer but also millennials and generation z customers which now represent more than half of our online customers in the us advertisement advertisement i couldn t be more excited about our new partnership with jennifer lopez it s my party tour to take place from june through august 2019 as you know jennifer lopez has an incredible reach across multiple generations all over the world with over 94 million followers on instagram she also relates to the latino community amazingly well which represents a big part of our customer base both inside and outside the us our previous campaign with her yielded significant benefits for the company and i think that this is a perfect partnership for guess we see millennials and generation z customers as our biggest growth opportunity they love the brand and shop us for street wear and vintage inspired trends viewing guess as accessible luxury they shop each collection launch and tend to purchase at full price we have launched initiatives to personalize our marketing and merchandising to increase engagement and have seen improvements with gen s gen z showing the highest conversion online this is a generation that is almost 50 larger than millennials and has a preference to shop in store a recent bloomberg study found that 95 of this gen z customers visited a store over a three month period versus 75 of millennials and 58 of generation xs ph we are also conducting tests in stores to increase the presence of key products developed for the gen z customer and we have seen strong sell through and meaningful productivity improvements when we did so second top line momentum and significant white space to grow globally we just closed our 15th consecutive quarter of comp growth in europe and our fifth consecutive quarter of comp growth in the americas while asia is experiencing weaker trends we believe this softening to be market driven and not brand specific and we still see very good long term potential in the region regarding china specifically i believe that we have an opportunity to build a big business there we currently have stores in only 34 of the top 60 cities with 90 of the guess stores being directly operated our e commerce business can also grow significantly considering that guess ranked among the top 50 international brands doing business with alibaba via tmall on 12 12 last year i see a big part of our growth to be organic growth advertisement advertisement the company invested considerably during the last few years to open new stores and strengthen our country management infrastructure i believe we now have significant capacity to grow through productivity increases in europe during the last three years we added 218 owned and operated stores and in asia we added 177 owned and operated stores in the same period primarily in greater china looking at some specific countries we have increased our position in key markets very effectively two good examples are poland and russia where we now have 54 and 37 stores respectively most of the stores were opened in the last three years we are growing in all channels in these countries and we see opportunities in other countries to do the same third e commerce penetration is still below best in class industry standards while our e commerce business in all regions is growing at a faster rate than the other channels our penetration is still below industry standards last year we did roughly 12 of our direct to consumer business online best in class companies are operating at between 30 and 40 penetration with the right technology and a perfected omni channel experience we don t see issues to significantly improve from where we are and with a bigger business we see an opportunity for margin expansion in this business as well fourth operating earnings growth during the last few years guess has driven significant adjusted operating earnings growth in a retail environment that has seen meaningful contraction both domestically and overseas considering our updated guidance for this year we expect to increase adjusted operating earnings again this year in the range of 13 to 22 this would imply a compounded growth of adjusted operating earnings of 25 over the last three years advertisement advertisement i see significant potential for margin expansion through cost reductions and operating efficiencies in our business and including the use of data analytics for inventory management supply chain distribution and marketing that number could continue to grow these are all very compelling opportunities that require tremendous effort and great execution i am committed to building a great team to tackle our future together we have amazing talent in our company and the commitment of our company of our people is absolutely extraordinary i can t wait to go through the journey together with that let me pass it to sandeep to give you more details on the financial results and guidance for the period sandeep sandeep reddy chief financial officer thank you carlos and good afternoon during this conference call our comments reference certain non gaap or adjusted measures please refer to today s earnings release for gaap reconciliations or descriptions of such measures first quarter revenues were 537 million up 3 in us dollars and 8 in constant currency versus the prior year i would like to highlight that this was our 11th consecutive quarter of revenue growth advertisement advertisement total company gross margin increased 50 basis points to 33 9 driven by higher imus and occupancy leverage this was on top of a 160 basis points improvement in gross margins in last year s first quarter adjusted sg a as a percentage of sales increased by 80 basis points primarily driven by the deleverage of expenses in asia adjusted operating loss for the first quarter was 22 million a deterioration of 10 versus the adjusted operating loss last year but within the range of our expectations adjusted operating margin finished 30 basis points lower than last year at negative 4 2 our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 11 down from 23 last year driven by the mix of statutory earnings adjusted diluted loss per share finished at the high end of our guidance at 0 25 now for some more color by segment americas retail revenues for the quarter finished up 3 in us dollars and up 4 in constant currency comp sales for the quarter including e commerce were up 4 in us dollars and 5 in constant currency marking our fifth consecutive quarter of positive comps the positive comps in the quarter were driven by better conversion and upt e commerce increased the comps for the quarter by two percentage points while the start to the second quarter was challenging our business has improved since the lead up to the memorial day weekend and our guidance for the quarter reflects this americas retail operating margins in the first quarter expanded 230 basis points marking our seventh consecutive quarter of operating margin expansion this was achieved through positive comps and sg a leverage partially offset by higher markdowns saying in the americas region i want to take a moment to talk about the americas wholesale business revenues grew 14 in us dollars and 16 in constant currency and were driven by a continuing strong performance in our us department store and specialty business the americas wholesale operating margins in the quarter expanded 210 basis points primarily through higher imu and sales leverage european revenues for the quarter grew versus last year by 2 in us dollars and 12 in constant currency and were driven by new store openings and positive comps comps including e commerce finished down 1 in us dollars and up 8 in constant currency e commerce improved the comps for the quarter by three percentage points the comp increase marked the 15th consecutive quarter of constant currency positive comps for the european region our european wholesale business also continues to be very strong we have closed our order book now for fall winter 2019 and have concluded our fifth consecutive season of double digit growth the growth for the fall winter season came from a combination of higher same door buys and new doors as we have resumed increasing our wholesale points of distribution european segment margin improved by 210 basis points due to lower markdowns higher imus and leverage from positive comps as a reminder we expect european a low european logistics cost to contribute at least 100 basis points to margin expansion in europe for the year moving to asia first quarter revenues were up 1 in us dollars and up 7 in constant currency comps including e commerce were down 15 in us dollars and down 10 in constant currency e commerce improved comps by 1 percentage point we experienced broad based weakness in our major markets in asia that is korea japan and china with a weak trend in traffic across all three markets in the quarter operating margin for the asia segment contracted 860 basis points in the quarter primarily due to expense deleverage as a result of the negative comps moving on to the balance sheet account receivable is 251 million up 3 in us dollars and 9 in constant currency in line with our revenue growth inventories were 478 million up 10 in us dollars and 15 in constant currency versus last year we are still carrying some excess inventory from the end of last year but continue to make progress on our plans to move through this inventory through a combination of our own retail outlet stores as well as stock liquidation channels as communicated on our last call in march we expect the inventory pressure to ease more in the back half of this year free cash flow was negative 115 million a deterioration of 28 million versus negative 87 million last year primarily driven by 29 million lower operating cash flows as a reminder the negative operating cash flows in the quarter include a 46 million payment for the eu commission fine so our free cash flows improved by 18 million excluding the impact of the eu commission fine as carlos mentioned in his prepared remarks we were excited to execute our five year 300 million convertible debt offering at the end of april the offering was combined with a bond hedge and warrant structure that enables us to protect against the economic risk of equity dilution up to a level of 47 on our stock price the cost of the bond hedge and warrant structure and transaction fees was approximately 38 million resulting in net proceeds from the offering of 262 million the majority of the net proceeds have already been deployed to do share repurchases through a combination of privately negotiated and open market transaction as well as through 170 million asr during the quarter we repurchased 10 3 million shares at a cost of 202 million 1 million of these shares were purchased on the open market prior to the planning and execution of the convertible bond transaction of the remaining 9 3 million shares 4 2 million shares were repurchased through privately negotiated and open market transactions and 5 1 million shares have already been delivered to us against the asr with the balance expected to be delivered after the completion of the asr by the end of the third quarter of this year we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 113 million compared to last year s 232 million cash less debt at the end of the quarter was negative 210 million compared to 192 million last year moving onto the guidance i should point out that our outlook for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2020 does not assume any asset impairment charges or any potential impact from the list 4 tariff increase on apparel and footwear imported from the into the us from china and mexico also guidance for revenues and comp sales for the total company and by segment is included in the supplemental table attached to our earnings release for the second quarter fiscal 2020 we expect revenues for the quarter to be up 7 to 8 in constant currency at prevailing exchange rates we estimate that currency will be roughly a 3 percentage point headwind on consolidated revenue growth for the quarter our gross margin is expected to be up primarily due to imu improvement from our supply chain initiatives the sg a rate is expected to be up compared to last year primarily due to an increased investment in advertising as well as continued deleverage in asia we are planning an operating margin for the quarter between 4 5 and 5 with a 20 basis point unfavorable impact form currency the adjusted earnings per share is planned in the range of 0 27 per share and 0 30 per share including 0 02 of headwind due to currency the earnings per share guidance includes 0 03 in accretion due to the impact of the convert transaction and share repurchases our adjusted eps guidance includes an assumption of 1 7 million of cash interest expense and amortization of loan fees related to the convertible debt transaction our tax rate for the quarter is estimated to be 25 we expect consolidated revenues for the year to be up between 6 and 7 in constant currency at prevailing exchange rates we estimate currency to have a 2 5 negative impact on consolidated revenue growth for the year for the full year we expect gross margins to be up due to improved imus in both the americas and europe as well as lower logistics and distribution costs in europe the adjusted sg a rate is expected to be up for the year due to an increase in investment in advertising as well as performance based compensation our adjusted tax rate for the year is estimated to be 25 we are planning an adjusted operating margin between 4 8 and 5 2 with minimal currency impact on operating margin and our guidance assumes that foreign currencies will remain roughly at prevailing rates adjusted earnings per share is planned in the range of 1 19 and 1 30 with a 0 03 headwind from currency this includes 0 10 in its estimated accretion due to the share repurchases and convert transactions our adjusted eps guidance includes an assumption of 5 3 million of cash interest and loan amortization expense as a reminder our prior guidance for the year was 1 09 to 1 21 with the currency tailwind of 0 02 the high end of our new guidance now represents a 33 increase over last year s adjusted eps capex for the year is expected to range from 55 million to 65 million to support store openings key store remodels and investments in our technology infrastructure to support long term growth please note that this is down from 108 million in the prior year the lower capex combined with our inventory and working capital management focus are expected to generate improved free cash flow this year even after considering the 46 million eu commission fine payment we made in the first quarter the board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend of 11 25 per share payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on june 19th 2019 with that i will conclude the company s remarks and open the call up for your questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and our first question comes from susan anderson from b riley fbr your line is now open susan anderson b riley fbr analyst hi good evening thanks so much for taking my question i was wondering if you can maybe carlos alberini chief executive officer yes hi susan susan anderson b riley fbr analyst talk about the guidance hi given just the inflection in the back half with a lower guidance in the second quarter maybe if you could kind of talk about by region where you re expecting kind of the acceleration to come from as we look out to the back half thanks sandeep reddy chief financial officer hi susan this is sandeep so i think you re right i mean i think with the performance that we ve had in the first quarter and the guidance that we re providing for the second quarter clearly to see the margin expansion in the year there s going to be some improvement in the back half and what i would take you to is i think from an underlying perspective the americas business and the european business is expected to continue being very strong all year and the only business where i think we ve seen some softness really is the asia business where we ve definitely taken the numbers down relative to what we talked about last time but i think if you think about the full year guidance the most material impact that we would see is really in the fourth quarter but last year we had some pretty material inventory charges because of the level of excess inventory we were carrying so as we lapped that that should be a help to actually have margin expansion during the back half of the year and that s what s embedded in the guidance for the full year susan anderson b riley fbr analyst got it that s helpful and then maybe just a follow up on asia it seems like there s just really weakness across all of the countries there i guess is it more is it is there anything more than just macro going on there i guess in terms of product acceptance and then also it looks like that you re expecting some improvement in the back half so maybe just talk about what s going to be driving that thanks carlos alberini chief executive officer yeah susan this is carlos hello i asia is definitely showing some softening as i said in my prepared remarks and the softening as you suggested has impacted those three big markets for us we do not think that this is brand specific frankly when we see the driver of that softening is primarily customer traffic both coming into our stores and visiting websites so we believe that this is probably goes beyond what is specific to us obviously it s very difficult to speculate what is that is driving that there are some comments from people saying well just the trade war may be having an impact definitely the government has made some changes and significant moves in china specifically to motivate the consumer to continue to spend they have done some things with vat reducing the rates for companies from 13 from 16 to 13 so there is some sign that definitely there is incentives going on to try to really reenergize the economy but it will be very speculative for us to say oh that s what it is we have seen that in most cases the traffic is definitely what s driving the changes and this slowdown now that being said we plan to continue to do what we can control which is thinking about product we are doing a lot of things globally to improve product and that includes from penetration trying to emphasize denim assortment as we said during our last call we are also putting a lot of effort into customer centricity initiatives and that this again our global initiatives our team in china specifically has done a great job in growing the crm database and we feel that there are opportunities to continue to do that effectively we have seen also an opportunity with tmall and of course we are talking to that team to benefit from those opportunities as well and then last but not least is inventory last year we had a major issue with inventories especially in the fourth quarter we had a significant access that we are trying to work through and we are doing that effectively but we feel that with the changes and with that excess inventory we really miss some opportunities especially in china and we think that we can do a better job in flowing inventory and having the right product at the right time in the right place and that is it s a it was tall order but we think that we have the tools to be able to do that much more effectively going forward sandeep reddy chief financial officer and susan just to susan anderson b riley fbr analyst got it sandeep reddy chief financial officer add to your last question on the guidance and the back half improvement one thing that s going to be happening this year the chinese new year is going to land earlier than last year and that benefit is embedded in our guidance and that s why in the front half we are really looking at down low double digits in constant currency and the full year is down high single digits and embedded in that it s a resumption of earlier chinese new year carlos alberini chief executive officer let me come back just i have talked quite a bit about china but i think another area that is it s worth pointing out is about japan s performance we were up against a phenomenal performance of for the first quarter of a year ago in japan and we did expect that we were not going to be able to comp those kind of numbers and sure enough that did happen and some people may look at this and say wow that s a disappointment that you couldn t comp i look at it as a great opportunity honestly because we now know what we need to do to win in that market and the way we won last year was remarkable it was a collaboration that we did with a group called generations and we think that in the past these kind of events and collaborations were more tests to prove a concept i feel that now we have the concepts proved and we have proven those time and time again we had a list of successes doing this kind of collaborations and we feel that this is going to be part of our business model going forward so in a way it has been somewhat painful to the numbers and the financial performance this quarter but i think that those kind of examples are very inspiring to to really pave a new path into how we build a business going forward especially attracting that younger consumer that we keep talking about susan anderson b riley fbr analyst got it that s very helpful and then just really quick on the inventory front are you guys still expecting i guess china and europe the excess to be cleaned up by the back half maybe if you just talk about kind of how much has been cleaned up so far and kind of where you re at with that thanks carlos alberini chief executive officer yeah so let me just start with that i am very impressed with our teams and i say teams because i think that this required an effort across different channels and across different regions to really address this issue and i think we have made great progress and when we look at our forecast and we are now running the company with forecasts in mind as opposed to looking at a rear view mirror and being much more actively looking at what s coming as opposed to what has been and i think when we look at how we think about turning the over the year the year end the numbers are very compelling so i feel that we are in great shape regardless inventory susan anderson b riley fbr analyst great thanks so much very helpful sandeep reddy chief financial officer and susan just to follow up on your question on timing of when we re going to work through it i think already in q1 there was a bit of a sequential improvement to where we finished up in q4 but we still have more work to do the material improvement will come in the back half but i think we you can expect to see sequential improvement as we go along susan anderson b riley fbr analyst great thanks so much good luck next quarter sandeep reddy chief financial officer thank you carlos alberini chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from omar saad from evercore isi your line is now open westcott rochette evercore isi analyst hi guys this is westcott on for omar first we just want to say congratulations and welcome we look forward to working with you carlos big picture kind of question carlos alberini chief executive officer thank you hi westcott rochette evercore isi analyst in terms of your capital allocation thinking about your store base your real estate with your digital as you kind of assess where you are in the us and europe are you looking to continue to expand the store expansion policy particularly in europe and how do you think about the balance over the next three years to four years of your store and store expansion policy versus pushing more aggressively in your digital carlos alberini chief executive officer yes thank you as i said we opened many many stores in both europe and asia during the last few years and we feel that we have a big opportunity to improve productivity in a lot of the new space but that being said we continue to see a lot of open wide space in multiple territories some of them we are in some of them we are not in and i think china s a great example of that we are in 34 of the top 60 cities but those 60 cities have more than one million people each so the opportunity here is tremendous and we are going to be very opportunistic and very careful with the way we look at expansion and how we address new store so we have no plans to stop store expansion here ph and that being said there is a big opportunity on digital but we don t see and i want to come back to table some of this answers to when we are ready to talk to you about our strategic planning process but we for now i don t see that getting all those or perfecting that omni channel experience that i have been talking about is going to be an initiative that is going to require huge amounts of capital so and that capital can take different forms in some cases maybe capex but in many other cases could be just partnering with companies that do this type of work through subscription models and that could be part of our operating expense structure westcott rochette evercore isi analyst okay that s great thank you and a question on europe it sounds like you are increasing your wholesale door partners is that a new strategy or is that something can you talk about how you re approaching the expansion of your wholesale partners in that market and maybe in other markets as well sandeep reddy chief financial officer so westcott this is sandeep so i think the story goes back about seven years or eight years because if you remember the sovereign debt crisis back in 2011 12 when there was a significant contraction in the wholesale distribution we lost a lot of doors especially in southern europe and over the last few years i mean we ve had five consecutive seasons of double digit growth the most of the growth in the first few of those seasons first three four of those seasons was actually coming from increased productivity again in the existing doors that we had but gradually as the health of the business is improving in the southern european countries especially we are now seeing opportunities to go into incremental those as well and broaden our distribution and recapture some of the distribution points that we had in the past as well and that s really what s going on right now we re still probably down a bit versus that peak but we re making progress toward getting back there carlos alberini chief executive officer and i just want to add that i think that this is a testimony to how strong the brand is in all over europe because this kind of appetite for more distribution only happens when the brand is super strong and the product is absolutely right for the markets and we are seeing that across the board and especially in europe westcott rochette evercore isi analyst great that s awesome and just one technical question on china and mexico have you updated or could you update your sourcing exposure to those two markets at this point carlos alberini chief executive officer yeah we are i mean we are doing basically what you have been hearing in the market we are working very actively on this and we are managing the situation the best we can shifting sourcing out of china as fast as we can sharing the impact of tariffs with vendors we are we have very strong relationships that go back many many years and in some cases these vendors have some other places where they are doing business so we are looking into placing the production with them in other places shipping products earlier we have been trying to really stay ahead of this issue and in many cases the vendors were able to react identifying opportunities to adjust prices we are looking at all pricing throughout and we see opportunities where we can adjust prices of course we want to be very careful with this because at the end of the day we don t want to impact demand but we do see pockets of opportunities depending on product categories and then overall just looking at cost savings opportunity across the board we are we engaged a firm that is helping us with the cost reduction opportunities and we are looking at multiple areas within the company we started with north america first and after this we re going to europe with this same type of program so overall just in the case of mexico the numbers are very small but we are also looking at mitigating exposure there as well westcott rochette evercore isi analyst okay and i think a couple of years ago last number i had was 47 was referenced can you give a ballpark roughly what the china exposure is carlos alberini chief executive officer yes sandeep reddy chief financial officer yeah so i think westcott as carlos mentioned it s a very fluid situation because we re actively working on making a number of changes as we go along so i don t think we re going to get into an update at this time but i think we re working on this process actively westcott rochette evercore isi analyst okay well thank you very much good luck guys carlos alberini chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from john kernan from cowen company your line is now open john kernan cowen company analyst good afternoon carlos and sandeep thanks for taking my question and carlos congrats on your first the 100 days back i guess carlos alberini chief executive officer thank you john kernan cowen company analyst so you ve been busy so you talked about assessing the cost structure particularly in americas and europe you were a big part of guess when the operating margin structure was significantly higher than it is now obviously the world has changed a lot since then but what do you think are the biggest opportunities in the cost structure because both in europe and in north america and what do you think a normalized operating margin structure looks like for this business carlos alberini chief executive officer yeah i mean we have talked about pursuing a double digit operating margin for the company in medium to long term so obviously we haven t lost that goal for the company and again this is more like a medium to long term discussion and i would like to address that when we come back after the summer after we have the opportunity to complete our work but that being said john this group that started doing this assessment are already looking at things and we see opportunities in labor scheduling structures for example and of course because we have so many stores we think that this can be a massive opportunity in terms of payroll in the stores and the whole idea here is not necessarily to spend less but to reallocate how we are spending money so it could be that that right now we have x number of hours that are dedicated throughout the day in an even way instead of allocating hours following the traffic patterns into the store so that just to give you an idea i have done this kind of work in my prior experiences and with great success so that s one area there is definitely in americas we see opportunities in sourcing and production as well we see opportunities in the whole corporate indirect expense we see opportunities in distribution and logistics though they are not that huge but i m sure that when we go to europe business given even before we do any assessment we know that the distribution and logistics opportunity in europe is very significant even just comparing to what we used to spend versus what we are currently spending to support the business and even comparing that level of spend to best in class in the industry to support a business of our size so i am very encouraged with the preliminary findings and i think that we re going to be very happy with what it does ph going through and executing on this plan john kernan cowen company analyst excellent thanks europe has had some pressures from the dc in terms of profitability and margins you did recover a little bit this quarter but we re still far below where we were a couple of years ago given some of the cost pressures there and how should we think about that piece the margin recovery just the distributions and logistics as that dc in benelux gets going sandeep reddy chief financial officer so john this is sandeep so i think if you look at this particular quarter we actually improved by 210 basis points and if my memory serves me right this is the first time in about six quarters that margins have actually gone the other way and and the interesting thing about this was this particular quarter the margin improvement really came from imu and leverage from positive comps for the most part a little bit from markdowns as well but i think those were the main drivers and for the year we ve already said previously that we expect at least 100 basis points of margin improvement from the logistics cost and the distribution center so i think obviously you can see that that s not the the logistics cost is not the only driver of margin expansion given how we started the started the year and the first quarter so we definitely expect to see margin recovery and improvement this year including the logistics improvement that we talked about carlos alberini chief executive officer and i think we talked about double digit margins for europe right sandeep reddy chief financial officer yeah exactly i think longer term the low double digit margin goal that we gave is there it s still definitely within reach and we won that far away from it a couple of years ago so i think as we recovered the logistics cost pressures that we re dealing with we re going to get there in a reasonably quick timeframe carlos alberini chief executive officer yeah and i want to add that remember last year in the fourth quarter we had to face the excess inventory issues that impacted not only asia but also europe and we feel that we are very well positioned to recapture that margin that we lost last year or this year so i think all that contributes to margin enhancement and last but not least the whole e commerce business you know even when that business is growing at a faster rate than the rest of the business and we are very happy with that we see a big opportunity as the business gets bigger to expand margins for e comm as well so there is multiple opportunities i think in europe to really expand operating margins john kernan cowen company analyst got it very helpful sandeep just a follow up to your comment imu has been a source of upside to the gross margin what stage are we in in terms of that being a benefit to gross margin going forward i know you ve done some things throughout the supply chain to bring that to improve the imu so just wondering how far into that improvement are we sandeep reddy chief financial officer i think we re really pleased with the progress that we ve made on the imu front over the last couple of years and you ve we ve included that in our guidance for this year as well and we re very happy with the progress that the team has made and i think it s going to be an effort that we continue to make as we go forward carlos mentioned sourcing and production as areas that we ll continue to look at responses ph out of the cost improvement initiatives so that process doesn t stop but i think as far as we re concerned we re always going to keep on focusing on making those improvements as we go along carlos alberini chief executive officer let me just add one more comment here i think that the just looking at what has been done i think that the company did an extraordinary job in improving imu during the last two years or three years but everything was done through some strategic repositioning of sourcing like taking a program from here and putting it over there and which i think is great and as a result we got the improved costing but i think that we now can look at a second level of reposition and that is by combining vendor basis between what we do here in america and what we do in europe those two areas are basically operating somewhat independently and we see a big opportunity when we start looking at our global platform that does sourcing and production together and now leverages vendor relations in a much at a much higher level and plans just production with a lot more foresight and secures capacity with those vendors and does fabric platforming so all these are kind of like a next level of operating efficiencies for us to really capitalize on that and continue to see improvements on imu ultimately john kernan cowen company analyst got it carlos alberini chief executive officer and we re working on that john kernan cowen company analyst thank you best of luck guys sandeep reddy chief financial officer thank you carlos alberini chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from dana telsey from telsey advisory group your line is now open dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst good afternoon everyone can you take us through carlos alberini chief executive officer hi dana dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst hi carlos can you take us through a little bit more about tariffs how you re thinking about it what it means whether it s china mexico and how you are planning and then also the wholesale business in the us seem to have done very well what are you seeing there in particular that s driving that strength thank you carlos alberini chief executive officer yeah dana we just addressed tariffs and really i m afraid that there isn t that much more new that i can tell you i mean just we as i said we are managing this very actively actually i am personally involved with this issues i m going to be in hong kong next week meeting with vendors with a whole team i mean we are doing everything here and i m excited because it will be my first opportunity to meet our entire current vendor base so i m afraid that i can t tell you more obviously we as we this is a moving target so just we are placing buys for or production orders for a holiday now and there are opportunities to really move a lot of that those orders into other places so this is good timing for us or for me to be involved with respect to wholesale we couldn t be more excited about this i mean wholesale the wholesale business here is a growing business we have very nice margins and frankly we think that we are just getting started we have with this generation z move we are seeing that retailers that in the past wouldn t have even considered us they are super excited to do a lot of business with us and just two great examples are urban outfitters and pacific sunwear and we have developed a very nice business with both of them and they are super happy and they want to continue to expand the relationship but also as the product has performed extremely well in the 90s as well so even the our traditional wholesale base is also doing very well with our brand and just i have to tell you we just did a pop up in fred segal who would have thought that guess was going to be represented in fred segal you know just that is a type of store that normally would only take luxury type of brands so so we are very excited about the wholesale business and we think that there is a lot more that we can do even just thinking about exclusives and thinking about how we really leverage these relationships that we have with on partnerships with key celebrities the whole idea with jennifer lopez is is something that our retail partners are also super excited about she s such a huge personality and so well known all over the world and so relevant for our customer our latino customers is a big it represents a big part of our customer base so having somebody like that representing the brands is just awesome dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst and then just on the expense side carlos or sandeep as you think about the deleverage of expenses in asia how are you thinking about that for the remainder of the year and carlos you mentioned more cost reductions to come using data analytics when do we see that how big an opportunity is that in size or what it could mean to the bottom line thank you sandeep reddy chief financial officer so so dana i ll take the first part definitely on the deleverage in asia i think that was the major driver of the first quarter expense deleverage and i think as we go into the second quarter that s another expected driver again of the deleverage and i think the problem we ve had is that the decline in comps has been very steep in the first quarter and second quarter and a big inflection versus where things were trending throughout last year so we re taking actions to address the cost structure but i think in terms of speed in which is going to happen within asia it s probably going to be it s going to be a little bit slow relative to the amount of comp degradation that we are anticipating in the guidance so the pressure is expected to be there within asia from a deleverage standpoint but i think from a cost opportunity across the company the total company there are a number of things that we re working on and i think carlos will touch on that carlos alberini chief executive officer yeah i think and it s not just cost reductions when we talk about data analytics i talk about just making sure that we use customer data in the right way to perfect personalized marketing which is something that we will be working on and we are already doing some testing there is also a lot that we can do on allocation and fulfillment and we are talking to a company that again i have used in the past to really optimize how we place inventory and where we place it and how we fulfill we have opportunities in logistics and distribution frankly this is huge both in north america and in europe to use data to do a better job in the way we service the business so there are i mean right now artificial intelligence and machine learning is like a big thing to be able to do a better job and become more efficient and we are trying to really partner up with people that have done this very successfully to just bring those benefits into the company so it s tough right now to size how big that opportunity is but i can tell you dana this is very meaningful and very significant dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst thank you carlos alberini chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from janet kloppenburg from jjk research associates incorporated your line is now open janet kloppenburg jjk research associates incorporated analyst hey carlos carlos alberini chief executive officer hi janet kloppenburg jjk research associates incorporated analyst it sounds like you put a great plan together it sounds very exciting carlos alberini chief executive officer thank you hi janet janet kloppenburg jjk research associates incorporated analyst just wondering maybe you could elaborate a little bit on this comparison in asia i guess you had a collaboration last year how long will that comparison continue that collaboration what tale does it have and i know your guidance on comps in asia for the second quarter but do you expect that there is some opportunity for comps to inflect in asia in the second half of the year and secondly in terms of the operating margin improvement i know you ve talked a lot about cost reduction but i wonder as you analyze the productivity historical productivity of the store base if perhaps that is an equal or greater opportunity to drive productivity there and and boost the operating margins perhaps you could talk about that thank you carlos alberini chief executive officer yeah let me start with your second question janet and then sandeep maybe he can talk about the comps with the history so i completely agree with you janet frankly when we look at how we can become more profitable in the company cost reductions obviously are a very compelling opportunity for us but more compelling is the whole productivity opportunity and our sales per square foot in the americas has has declined very significantly over the last few years and is turning for the better in the last maybe four quarters but that being said we are not where we want to be not even close and i think that for me that it starts with product and this is going back to those product categories that the company was always very strong at like denim like handbags like accessories the men s business is doing pretty well but we see more opportunity with that so just if we can really perfect the product we have a much better opportunity to increase productivity and with that because we own the stores we own the fixed cost structure we can make a lot more money our margins are very nice frankly i don t think that the product margins are an issue here obviously maybe we ll have some opportunities and i maybe as we said earlier but ultimately the big thing here is to do more with less just create an opportunity for higher productivity and the same thing is true in europe especially with the new stores because there has been all these new stores that are operating very well and pretty much in line with the original expectations when those stores were opened but the productivity is lower than the comp base so we see opportunities there as well so just i couldn t agree with you more but part of the issue here too is to put the product in the right place right at the right time similar to what i was saying about allocation and planning just how we use the inventory in those stores is also important and do you want to take the comps sandeep reddy chief financial officer yeah sure and janet kloppenburg jjk research associates incorporated analyst just one question carlos do you think that the tools that you have to manage that inventory and the data analytics that you re talking about how soon or effective could those tools become in driving productivity carlos alberini chief executive officer yeah no the tools are not here i mean we are i mean we have some tools of course we have planning and allocation systems but what i m talking about it would take some time but most of these applications sit on top of our it infrastructure so it s not something that we are talking about going and implementing sap here it s more about bringing these applications that sit on top of what we already have so the implementation time is significantly shorter so we re talking about just i think we re not going to see much of this this year but definitely next year for sure janet kloppenburg jjk research associates incorporated analyst thank you sandeep reddy chief financial officer so janet janet kloppenburg jjk research associates incorporated analyst multiple speakers yeah sandeep reddy chief financial officer yeah janet this is me ph sandeep how are you doing janet kloppenburg jjk research associates incorporated analyst all right hi sandeep sandeep reddy chief financial officer so janet i think your question was really on i think specifically about the partnership that we had in the first quarter last year that actually had a big impact on us on comps that was in japan it was with the generations band and that actually started off in the first quarter and actually spilled into the second quarter as well so there is an impact both in q1 and q2 and i think when you look at the full year guidance we actually got some improvement baked in in the back half because our full year guidance is down to the high single digits even though the front half is down low double digits and i think but that s mostly driven by the timing of chinese new year because chinese new year is going to be earlier this year than last year and that s going to benefit the fourth quarter so i think that s really the high level of the guidance cadence for asia janet kloppenburg jjk research associates incorporated analyst okay thank you so much carlos alberini chief executive officer thank you janet sandeep reddy chief financial officer thank you i think this is probably the last caller question we could take because we re running out of time so operator operator and we have no further questions in queue at this time i ll turn the call back to carlos for closing remarks carlos alberini chief executive officer thank you well thank you all for joining us today i believe that we have tremendous opportunities as a company so i think we can deliver significant shareholder value and we remain highly committed here to optimizing the business and we want to drive strong revenue growth healthy profit expansion and we think that we are well positioned to do so so we look forward to sharing with you our strategic business plan as we said at the end of the summer thanks again for participating and have a great rest of the week and weekend thank you so much operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today s teleconference thank you for participating you may now disconnect duration 69 minutes call participants carlos alberini chief executive officer sandeep reddy chief

open this photo in gallery recession is not a given bond markets may be pointing that way but some other indicators such as equity markets are not as bearish the associated press after almost three years of successfully predicting a global economic revival world bond markets are furiously flagging the risk of yet another recession as well as low inflation for a generation spooked by the escalating u s china trade war long term interest rates embedded in government bond markets widely seen as the most accurate predictors of future economic activity and inflation have relapsed into deep troughs u s treasury yields have plunged 50 basis points in seven weeks while sub zero german 10 year bond yields are at record lows in japan britain switzerland and france borrowing costs are at their lowest since 2016 when financial markets were hit by a combination of blows including britain s shock decision to leave the european union and an economic slowdown in china recession is not a given bond markets may be pointing that way but some other indicators such as equity markets are not as bearish however trade tensions also including a recent u s plan to impose tariffs on mexico may be what s making the present slide in bond yields different we have to pay attention said franck dixmier global head of fixed income for allianz global which manages more than us 560 billion in assets we know from experience that bond markets are quite good at predicting future economic developments and what s being priced in more and more is the consequence of a clear escalation of trade tensions expectations for future inflation globally have tumbled as a result of fears about slowing growth or recession at a time when major central banks have limited ammunition following years of ultra easy monetary policy britain is an exception because of brexit the most prominent bearish signal for economic growth is coming from the u s bond curve where the three month 10 year yield curve is near its most inverted since 2007 the months leading up to the global financial crisis an inverted curve where long dated yields are below short dated ones has proved a powerful recessionary indicator in a strong sign that markets are bracing for rate cuts most of the u s curve is below the target range for the federal funds rate of 2 25 per cent to 2 5 per cent short term interest rate futures imply the u s federal reserve could start cutting rates as soon as next month the yield curve is still a very good indicator because when you look at the curve and the correlation between this and macro economic variables this hasn t changed for 20 years said pictet asset management chief strategist luca paolini adding that a recession but not a deep one was likely trust me but reading the bond market tea leaves is not easy the predictive power of the u s bond curve has been hurt by the prolonged easy monetary policy and demand for bonds from institutional investors such as pension and insurance funds that s played a part in suppressing long dated yields making it easier for the curve to invert u s unemployment has always risen before recessions but is currently near 50 year lows equities are holding up well as are the riskier sections of the corporate bond market economic data too while disappointing has not been dire in the united states the institute for supply management s ism manufacturing activity index is at its lowest level since 2016 but above the 50 mark consistent with expansion bluebay asset management s chief investment officer mark dowding notes that in 2016 when fears about weak global growth and inflation last gripped markets the ism plunged to 48 and oil prices slumped to around 30 now oil prices while at four month lows are double the levels three years ago trade war weak economy but the deep trade tensions at play today could make this situation different according to analysts and investors u s two year treasury yields last week notched up their biggest weekly fall since 2009 just as u s president donald trump vowed to impose tariffs on mexico while markets had until last month broadly expected a constructive outcome neil mackinnon global macro strategist at vtb capital said that now investors see the dispute as part of a larger more complex long term hegemonic battle and for markets that is more dangerous and uncertain investment banks have changed their views on growth and central bank policy morgan stanley now projects global growth will stagnate at current levels for the rest of 2019 jpmorgan expects two u s rate cuts this year and goldman sachs says its downside risk scenario for german bund yields is 50 basis points versus the current 0 25 bps the international monetary fund meanwhile cut its world growth forecasts this week and germany s central bank also slashed predictions for the country s economy expecting it grow this year by just 0 6 per cent some central banks have moved to easing mode already new zealand australia and india have cut rates and even fed officials have raised that possibility against that backdrop we have to ask is that consistent with investors thinking the fed is fine tuning policy or is there a fundamental economic backdrop that s far worse than we had thought said sunil krishnan head of multi asset funds at aviva investors some of the buying interest in treasuries is taking the more pessimistic view european central bank chief mario draghi this week sought to reassure investors the bank was ready to act if needed even holding out the prospect of more rate cuts or resuming bond buying stimulus nervous investors plowed a record us 12 3 billion into higher quality investment grade bonds in the week to wednesday bank of america merrill lynch said and the pool of negative yielding bonds globally has swelled to more than us 10 trillion banks estimate absent inflation for central banks especially the ecb perhaps the most worrying bond market signal is that inflation will remain below target for years market pricing of inflation expectations in the euro area suggest inflation could remain below target for at least two decades a key market gauge of euro area inflation expectations is at record lows below 1 25 per cent the ecb targets an inflation rate of just below 2 per cent but it has undershot this since 2013 and that s after unprecedented stimulus it seems to be very difficult to see inflation going above target on a five to 10 year view said bluebay s mr dowding and even if trade tensions and with it global recession fears ebb other

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by ross finley london reuters the synchronized global economic expansion cheered on by investors who pushed wall street stocks to a record high last month has started to sour and is increasingly at risk from a developing trade war between the world s two largest economies a group of several hundred economists and financial market professionals regularly polled by reuters over the past few years has consistently and almost unanimously warned that trade conflict is the number one global economic risk related stories central bankers and finance ministers from the g20 countries will have this to contemplate as they meet over the weekend in fukuoka japan under the long shadow of the america first policy pursued by their still dominant member as the u s china trade war has dragged on and evidence piles up that trade volumes are taking a knock those warnings seem all the more prescient federal reserve chair jerome powell appears to have come round to a similar view if market bets are even remotely correct the fed which just months ago looked set to hike interest rates several times this year may be only months away from following several other important world central banks like australia s and new zealand s in cutting rates j p morgan one of the largest u s banks is already forecasting two fed rate cuts this year but is casting that essentially as a successful insurance policy with very modest changes to their outlook for global growth next year for her part christine lagarde head of the international monetary fund told reuters recently that the u s china trade war will not cause a global recession but that the trade spat amounted to self inflicted wounds the problem is it s ongoing and until it stops there is no way to accurately forecast what will happen next nor can one really predict what goes on in the minds of the world s company executives with respect to future investment decisions citi economists are among those who have tried and what they foresaw was not pretty recent developments remain consistent with our long held view that trade tensions have not peaked and are expected to continue with and beyond china wrote citi economist cesar rojas in a client note amid a relative balance between domestic resilience and external headwinds a metastasized global trade war would likely trigger a cascade of economic and financial reactions that would tip the global economy into a growth recession he wrote make no mistake the united states which has easily outperformed its peers is still growing reasonably strongly with the latest read on its vast non manufacturing industries which make up the bulk of production topping expectations but private sector economists most of whom are still chastised by the market for missing the last u s recession see a significant 40 percent chance of a slump in the next two years even the mighty u s dollar is catching a whiff of it on a shorter time horizon past experience shows once a recession probability gets consistently that high in economists minds which are tempered by other things like what s good for business there is a good chance it has already started policymakers of course can ease their language and cut interest rates but they rarely forecast economic slumps doing so is counterproductive in setting policy aimed at supporting economies one of their unwritten roles is to cheerlead their main role in most cases is to manage inflation yet apart from rampant asset price inflation in the decade since the great recession and a sprinkling of wage inflation as the u s jobless rate plumbs half century lows there has been acceleration in little else that last point was underscored at the european central bank s news conference on thursday where it again extended its view on how long rates are likely to remain unchanged to mid 2020 inflation expectations have dropped sharply for the u s the euro zone and britain since late last year and consensus forecasts remain below central banks targets for this year and next over the past few months the inflation outlook has been cut with lower lows over the forecast horizon that is all the more remarkable given that in most cases rates in the developed world barely reached what would have been described as neutral neither stimulative nor restrictive before the last financial crisis even the reserve bank of india managing one of the fastest growing economies in the world just delivered a third successive interest rate cut can we chalk all of this up to central bank success in taming inflation or is it that inflation is being driven by global forces not under their control ecb president mario draghi pointed out on thursday several factors damaging economic sentiment that he can t control including geopolitical uncertainty and of course the rising threat of protectionism additional reporting by hari kishan in bengaluru editing by hugh lawson
after almost three years of successfully predicting a global economic revival world bond markets are furiously flagging the risk of yet another recession as well as low inflation for a generation spooked by the escalating u s china trade war long term interest rates embedded in government bond markets widely seen as the most accurate predictors of future economic activity and inflation have relapsed into deep troughs u s treasury yields have plunged 50 basis points in seven weeks while sub zero german 10 year bond yields are at record lows in japan britain switzerland and france borrowing costs are at their lowest since 2016 when financial markets were hit by a combination of blows including britain s shock decision to leave the european union and an economic slowdown in china recession is not a given bond markets may be pointing that way but some other indicators such as equity markets are not as bearish however trade tensions also including a recent u s plan to impose tariffs on mexico may be what s making the present slide in bond yields different we have to pay attention said franck dixmier global head of fixed income for allianz global which manages more than 560 billion in assets we know from experience that bond markets are quite good at predicting future economic developments and what s being priced in more and more is the consequence of a clear escalation of trade tensions expectations for future inflation globally have tumbled as a result of fears about slowing growth or recession at a time when major central banks have limited ammunition following years of ultra easy monetary policy britain is an exception because of brexit the most prominent bearish signal for economic growth is coming from the u s bond curve where the 3 month 10 year yield curve is near its most inverted since 2007 the months leading up to the global financial crisis an inverted curve where long dated yields are below short dated ones has proved a powerful recessionary indicator in a strong sign that markets are bracing for rate cuts most of the u s curve is below the target range for the federal funds rate of 2 25 2 50 short term interest rate futures imply the u s federal reserve could start cutting rates as soon as next month the yield curve is still a very good indicator because when you look at the curve and the correlation between this and macro economic variables this hasn t changed for 20 years said pictet asset management chief strategist luca paolini adding that a recession but not a deep one was likely but reading the bond market tea leaves is not easy the predictive power of the u s bond curve has been hurt by the prolonged easy monetary policy and demand for bonds from institutional investors such as pension and insurance funds that s played a part in suppressing long dated yields making it easier for the curve to invert u s unemployment has always risen before recessions but is currently near 50 year lows equities are holding up well as are the riskier sections of the corporate bond market economic data too while disappointing has not been dire in the united states the institute for supply management s ism manufacturing activity index is at its lowest level since 2016 but above the 50 mark consistent with expansion bluebay asset management s chief investment officer mark dowding notes that in 2016 when fears about weak global growth and inflation last gripped markets the ism plunged to 48 and oil prices slumped to around 30 now oil prices while at 4 month lows are double the levels three years ago but the deep trade tensions at play today could make this situation different according to analysts and investors u s two year treasury yields last week notched up their biggest weekly fall since 2009 just as u s president donald trump vowed to impose tariffs on mexico while markets had until last month broadly expected a constructive outcome neil mackinnon global macro strategist at vtb capital said that now investors see the dispute as part of a larger more complex long term hegemonic battle and for markets that is more dangerous and uncertain investment banks have changed their views on growth and central bank policy morgan stanley now projects global growth will stagnate at current levels for the rest of 2019 jpmorgan expects two u s rate cuts this year and goldman sachs says its downside risk scenario for german bund yields is 50 basis points versus the current 0 25 bps the international monetary fund meanwhile cut its world growth forecasts this week and germany s central bank also slashed predictions for the country s economy expecting it grow this year by just 0 6 some central banks have moved to easing mode already new zealand australia and india have cut rates and even fed officials have raised that possibility against that backdrop of rate cut bets we have to ask is that consistent with investors thinking the fed is fine tuning policy or is there a fundamental economic backdrop that s far worse than we had thought said sunil krishnan head of multi asset funds at aviva investors some of the buying interest in treasuries is taking the more pessimistic view european central bank chief mario draghi this week sought to reassure investors the bank was ready to act if needed even holding out the prospect of more rate cuts or resuming bond buying stimulus nervous investors plowed a record 12 3 billion into higher quality investment grade bonds in the week to wednesday bank of america merrill lynch said and the pool of negative yielding bonds globally has swelled to over 10 trillion banks estimate for central banks especially the ecb perhaps the most worrying bond market signal is that inflation will remain below target for years market pricing of inflation expectations in the euro area suggest inflation could remain below target for at least two decades a key market gauge of euro area inflation expectations is at record lows below 1 25 the ecb targets an inflation rate of just below 2 but it has undershot this since 2013 and that s after unprecedented stimulus it seems to be very difficult to see inflation going above target on a 5 10 year view said bluebay s dowding and even if trade tensions and with it global recession fears ebb other uncertainties brexit italy s budget clash with the eu suggest bonds will hold their cachet for some

currency investments can complement any balanced portfolio but there are a lot of misconceptions and missteps that can occur if an investor is not properly informed before trading or buying and holding them you re taking a bet that one country s economy is going to be better than another says chris telmer associate professor of financial economics at carnegie mellon university s tepper school of business investing in currencies is a way to become engaged with global macroeconomics it often also requires a learning curve so heed the following advice from experts before buying into currencies advertisement advertisement consider using a broker invest for the long term stick to major stable currencies buy an etf or mutual fund rather than individual currencies beware of levered currency investments consider using a broker trading by definition happens on a day by day high frequency basis which makes being educated about specific topics industries and asset classes necessary trading currency otherwise known as forex trading allows investors to trade currencies 24 hours per day on weekdays and potentially make big profits but if you re not 100 comfortable doing it on your own choose a broker that knows what he or she is doing says jeffrey cammack who runs a website called tradeforex sa advertisement advertisement there are many on the internet that claim to be experts however they are not actually authorized brokers he says one should never trade with brokers that are not regulated brokers in the united states should be be registered with the securities and exchange commission and members of financial industry regulatory authority finra invest for the long term mayra rodriguez valladares managing principal at mrv associates who started her career in foreign exchange at the federal reserve bank of new york believes the foreign exchange market is the most volatile one in which to trade after commodities advertisement advertisement in order to be a good currency trader you need to know a lot about country and economics risks because currencies are very sensitive to country risks like sovereign defaults expropriation nationalization corruption unstable governments and economic risks like inflation gdp levels and employment rates she says and aside from major currencies such as the british pound u s dollar japanese yen and swiss franc other currencies can be illiquid making them riskier currency is bought and sold in pairs and using one in relation to the other because of this trading isn t for everyone but that doesn t mean you need to stay away from currencies advertisement advertisement if you invest for the long haul currencies are not any riskier than an individual stock telmer says just like a stock an investor can then check on the currency every few months to see how it is performing stick to major stable currencies countries with unstable governments inflation history high regulations and the like are not prudent investments telmer says take argentina which was a popular trading currency before an international currency crisis shut down the banking system in the 2000s investing in brazil chile or mexico now for example may be riskier but on average you might get a higher return relative to the u s dollar or euro which may pay two to three percent interest telmer says if the currency goes up in value you get that plus your interest but if the currency goes down against the dollar there goes your interest and in a really volatile country like venezuela your investment could even be seized by the government advertisement advertisement buy an etf or mutual fund currency investment risks can be partly mitigated by buying into mutual funds and exchange traded funds provide diversification as well as doing the macroeconomic research for you and often rank currencies by which are paying the highest interest rates telmer says the deutsche bank g10 currency future harvest index is made up of currency futures contracts on certain g10 currencies and is designed to capitalize on currencies with high interest rates the invesco db g10 currency harvest fund ticker dbv is currently trading at about 24 and tracks this index yielding a year to date return of about 3 3 percent advertisement advertisement without an etf or fund you d plan to hold the currencies until monetary policies change which govern interest rates and evaluate your options then he adds which requires you to be much more active still curious about what s going on with the fund you can keep tabs on the latest data from the institute of international finance or the centre for global finance to get educated and seek educational guidance on trading platforms beware of levered currency investments many online currency investing and trading platforms have core businesses providing leverage or margin for currency trading which is inherently riskier telmer says by only purchasing currency with the cash you have you can potentially mitigate the losses kayleigh kulp is a freelance journalist who also writes or has written for cnbc the daily beast afar the washington post travel channel travel leisure cnn fox

term financial outlook the company s actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on risk factors included in today s press release and the company s quarterly and annual reports filed with the sec i would now like to turn the call over to carlos carlos alberini chief executive officer thank you operator good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today now that i have just passed the milestone of my first 100 days in this role i would like to comment on the progress that we have made since our last call last month we celebrated the 38th anniversary of guess with a wonderful global meeting in barcelona that we referred to as the one world one brand conference the first conference of this kind took place back in 2006 and this one was our eighth one we invited a large number of our associates from all over the world to the conference as well as our product licensees key joint venture partners franchisees another key global colleagues and partners the energy and ideas that were shared at the conference were truly inspiring while there were several important topics including the three day agenda customer centricity and brand relevancy were the main focus of the meeting the venue was the perfect one to share my strategic vision for the company which reads as follows at guess we are obsessed with our customers our customers represent multiple generations that are young sexy and adventures at heart we inspire our customers to express their true selves through the people they relate to the way they dress how they spend their free time the

is a conscious catalyst organization that cares about environmentally responsible practices and a great work environment guess is a company that gives back to the world to make it a better place with a sharing of our vision statement with our entire team we officially launched our strategic planning cycle this year at the end of the conference key members of our executive team stayed on to kick off the process the team is already working hard to complete the project and as i committed to you during our last call we plan to come back to you with an update on it after the end of the summer in the meantime we continue to make solid progress on key projects that we have launched applying the key principles that i mentioned before to take advantage of value creation opportunities for our company let me start with capital allocation as we reviewed the value creation opportunity relative to our operating performance and our expected future cash flows it was clear to us that there is material incremental value in our company as we take actions to improve our operating performance these represent changes that are completely under our control and we plan to attack in the short to medium term for this reason we made a strategic decision to redeploy capital and return incremental value to our shareholders through significant share repurchases while reducing our dividend by 50 as you know our board approved a plan to raise 300 million in convertible debt which we executed during the quarter and the majority of the net proceeds have already been deployed or have been committed to repurchase stock we expect the impact from the convert transaction and share repurchases to be accretive to our adjusted eps this year by 0 10 per share we are really excited with the transaction as we achieved very favorable terms our interest coupon is 2 and we were able to buy a bond hedge and warrants to eliminate the economic dilution unless the stock price exceeds 47 with the shares repurchase so far and the completion of the asr we expect to buy about 17 of the shares that were outstanding at the beginning of the year and we believe the incremental value to shareholders over time will be very material at the same time we ll continue to prioritize our capital allocation toward investments that support growth and infrastructure based on their strategic significance and the return on invested capital expectations additionally we have already taken steps from an inventory management perspective to ensure that inventories are planned and managed in a very disciplined way the results of this actions are already materializing in our inventory forecasts for the remainder of the year second product development and distribution optimization as i mentioned last time we have a number of key product categories such as denim accessories marciano and men s that if better assorted and represented in stores and online can drive incremental sales for us for instance we have already implemented plans to increase capacity for our denim product in 219 of our stores globally for foreign holidays this includes 90 stores in the us we are also working on introducing additional fashion styles to provide more variety in the denim assortment our marketing campaign for the summer and full seasons will feature denim prominently to reclaim our dominance in the category in addition we now see significant opportunities to design and develop product for the key target customer groups and having the right product in the right place at the right time will become also a big priority this involves speed to market and the use of analytics and technology for the digitalization of the supply chain we have also reorganized our marciano team to address local customer preferences more effectively going forward we will operate with two design teams as we do with the guess line one team will be based in los angeles to serve the north america region and the other one in stabio switzerland to serve europe third global strategies i continue to believe that we have a tremendous opportunity to leverage and support our global business more effectively by reorganizing accountability and strengthening our infrastructure including the use of technology and data analytics in areas such as inventory management logistics and distribution sourcing and product development store site selection and product pricing and we are already evaluating options to invest in process improvement tools in all of these areas regarding functional accountabilities we are approaching several operational and support areas with a consistent global focus some examples of functions with global responsibilities are finance strategy it logistics sources and product development inventory management human resources and real estate fourth cost structure optimization there are definite areas of opportunities for significant cost savings and operating efficiencies in our company we have already engaged a consulting firm to study and assess our cost structure and identify opportunities in the americas and in europe i believe the results of this assessment will give us a roadmap for executing improvements to our operation and cost structure to drive incremental profitability and fifth customer centricity which as i have said in the past consists of placing the customer at the center of everything we do including perfecting the omni channel experience we have strong customer files in the americas europe and asia that provide a lot of insight into the customer s product purchase history and their behavioral shopping patterns by leveraging this data we ll be able to map the customer journey and through predictive analytics be able to personalize marketing effectively and delight the customers by delivering the product and experience that they are looking for we re also reassessing our current systems and tools to deliver a seamless omni channel shopping experience we plan to implement new technology to perfect our capabilities globally regarding our financial results for the first quarter we reported another quarter of strong revenue growth we reported a 3 increase in revenues 8 growth in constant currency during the period we increased gross margins by 50 basis points company wide and we managed expenses well our adjusted operating loss finished within the range of our guidance and our adjusted loss per share finished at the high end of our guidance our financial results this quarter represented strong performance in the americas and europe partially offset by weakness in asia let me quickly comment on the situation in asia it has become clear to us during the course of the first quarter that there has been a significant softening in the business and we see that in the form of lower traffic both through our stores and through our e commerce platforms including tmall where we sell our product on while in the short term this is painful for the business we still see very good long term potential in the region as we don t believe that the current issues will impair our ability to capitalize on that potential looking ahead i want to talk briefly about tariffs on imports from china and mexico into the us as others in the industry have been doing we are taking actions to mitigate the impact from the potential increase in tariffs this actions include cost sharing with our suppliers shifting sourcing to other countries of origin raising prices if the pricing still delivers the value in the product of our customer is looking for and offsetting this increased cost with other cost saving initiatives of course if the list 4 tariffs go to 25 the impact to us will be meaningful but the situation is still fluid and we will continue to accelerate the mitigation actions as the situation evolves before i conclude over the last three months i have spent considerable time reflecting on my role at guess and on all the opportunities that i see for our company today i want to share with you how excited i am about my job and our company s opportunity to execute on the vision that i shared with you earlier i will focus on four big points that make this opportunity extraordinary first brand relevancy and attracting a new younger customer i strongly believe that the guess brand continues to gain relevancy in today s retail marketplace on a global level our celebrity partnerships and collaborations continue to draw significant customer interest into our brands attracting not only our traditional guess customer which we call our heritage customer but also millennials and generation z customers which now represent more than half of our online customers in the us i couldn t be more excited about our new partnership with jennifer lopez it s my party tour to take place from june through august 2019 as you know jennifer lopez has an incredible reach across multiple generations all over the world with over 94 million followers on instagram she also relates to the latino community amazingly well which represents a big part of our customer base both inside and outside the us our previous campaign with her yielded significant benefits for the company and i think that this is a perfect partnership for guess we see millennials and generation z customers as our biggest growth opportunity they love the brand and shop us for street wear and vintage inspired trends viewing guess as accessible luxury they shop each collection launch and tend to purchase at full price we have launched initiatives to personalize our marketing and merchandising to increase engagement and have seen improvements with gen s gen z showing the highest conversion online this is a generation that is almost 50 larger than millennials and has a preference to shop in store a recent bloomberg study found that 95 of this gen z customers visited a store over a three month period versus 75 of millennials and 58 of generation xs ph we are also conducting tests in stores to increase the presence of key products developed for the gen z customer and we have seen strong sell through and meaningful productivity improvements when we did so second top line momentum and significant white space to grow globally we just closed our 15th consecutive quarter of comp growth in europe and our fifth consecutive quarter of comp growth in the americas while asia is experiencing weaker trends we believe this softening to be market driven and not brand specific and we still see very good long term potential in the region regarding china specifically i believe that we have an opportunity to build a big business there we currently have stores in only 34 of the top 60 cities with 90 of the guess stores being directly operated our e commerce business can also grow significantly considering that guess ranked among the top 50 international brands doing business with alibaba via tmall on 12 12 last year i see a big part of our growth to be organic growth the company invested considerably during the last few years to open new stores and strengthen our country management infrastructure i believe we now have significant capacity to grow through productivity increases in europe during the last three years we added 218 owned and operated stores and in asia we added 177 owned and operated stores in the same period primarily in greater china looking at some specific countries we have increased our position in key markets very effectively two good examples are poland and russia where we now have 54 and 37 stores respectively most of the stores were opened in the last three years we are growing in all channels in these countries and we see opportunities in other countries to do the same third e commerce penetration is still below best in class industry standards while our e commerce business in all regions is growing at a faster rate than the other channels our penetration is still below industry standards last year we did roughly 12 of our direct to consumer business online best in class companies are operating at between 30 and 40 penetration with the right technology and a perfected omni channel experience we don t see issues to significantly improve from where we are and with a bigger business we see an opportunity for margin expansion in this business as well fourth operating earnings growth during the last few years guess has driven significant adjusted operating earnings growth in a retail environment that has seen meaningful contraction both domestically and overseas considering our updated guidance for this year we expect to increase adjusted operating earnings again this year in the range of 13 to 22 this would imply a compounded growth of adjusted operating earnings of 25 over the last three years i see significant potential for margin expansion through cost reductions and operating efficiencies in our business and including the use of data analytics for inventory management supply chain distribution and marketing that number could continue to grow these are all very compelling opportunities that require tremendous effort and great execution i am committed to building a great team to tackle our future together we have amazing talent in our company and the commitment of our company of our people is absolutely extraordinary i can t wait to go through the journey together with that let me pass it to sandeep to give you more details on the financial results and guidance for the period sandeep sandeep reddy chief financial officer thank you carlos and good afternoon during this conference call our comments reference certain non gaap or adjusted measures please refer to today s earnings release for gaap reconciliations or descriptions of such measures first quarter revenues were 537 million up 3 in us dollars and 8 in constant currency versus the prior year i would like to highlight that this was our 11th consecutive quarter of revenue growth total company gross margin increased 50 basis points to 33 9 driven by higher imus and occupancy leverage this was on top of a 160 basis points improvement in gross margins in last year s first quarter adjusted sg a as a percentage of sales increased by 80 basis points primarily driven by the deleverage of expenses in asia adjusted operating loss for the first quarter was 22 million a deterioration of 10 versus the adjusted operating loss last year but within the range of our expectations adjusted operating margin finished 30 basis points lower than last year at negative 4 2 our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 11 down from 23 last year driven by the mix of statutory earnings adjusted diluted loss per share finished at the high end of our guidance at 0 25 now for some more color by segment americas retail revenues for the quarter finished up 3 in us dollars and up 4 in constant currency comp sales for the quarter including e commerce were up 4 in us dollars and 5 in constant currency marking our fifth consecutive quarter of positive comps the positive comps in the quarter were driven by better conversion and upt e commerce increased the comps for the quarter by two percentage points while the start to the second quarter was challenging our business has improved since the lead up to the memorial day weekend and our guidance for the quarter reflects this americas retail operating margins in the first quarter expanded 230 basis points marking our seventh consecutive quarter of operating margin expansion this was achieved through positive comps and sg a leverage partially offset by higher markdowns saying in the americas region i want to take a moment to talk about the americas wholesale business revenues grew 14 in us dollars and 16 in constant currency and were driven by a continuing strong performance in our us department store and specialty business the americas wholesale operating margins in the quarter expanded 210 basis points primarily through higher imu and sales leverage european revenues for the quarter grew versus last year by 2 in us dollars and 12 in constant currency and were driven by new store openings and positive comps comps including e commerce finished down 1 in us dollars and up 8 in constant currency e commerce improved the comps for the quarter by three percentage points the comp increase marked the 15th consecutive quarter of constant currency positive comps for the european region our european wholesale business also continues to be very strong we have closed our order book now for fall winter 2019 and have concluded our fifth consecutive season of double digit growth the growth for the fall winter season came from a combination of higher same door buys and new doors as we have resumed increasing our wholesale points of distribution european segment margin improved by 210 basis points due to lower markdowns higher imus and leverage from positive comps as a reminder we expect european a low european logistics cost to contribute at least 100 basis points to margin expansion in europe for the year moving to asia first quarter revenues were up 1 in us dollars and up 7 in constant currency comps including e commerce were down 15 in us dollars and down 10 in constant currency e commerce improved comps by 1 percentage point we experienced broad based weakness in our major markets in asia that is korea japan and china with a weak trend in traffic across all three markets in the quarter operating margin for the asia segment contracted 860 basis points in the quarter primarily due to expense deleverage as a result of the negative comps moving on to the balance sheet account receivable is 251 million up 3 in us dollars and 9 in constant currency in line with our revenue growth inventories were 478 million up 10 in us dollars and 15 in constant currency versus last year we are still carrying some excess inventory from the end of last year but continue to make progress on our plans to move through this inventory through a combination of our own retail outlet stores as well as stock liquidation channels as communicated on our last call in march we expect the inventory pressure to ease more in the back half of this year free cash flow was negative 115 million a deterioration of 28 million versus negative 87 million last year primarily driven by 29 million lower operating cash flows as a reminder the negative operating cash flows in the quarter include a 46 million payment for the eu commission fine so our free cash flows improved by 18 million excluding the impact of the eu commission fine as carlos mentioned in his prepared remarks we were excited to execute our five year 300 million convertible debt offering at the end of april the offering was combined with a bond hedge and warrant structure that enables us to protect against the economic risk of equity dilution up to a level of 47 on our stock price the cost of the bond hedge and warrant structure and transaction fees was approximately 38 million resulting in net proceeds from the offering of 262 million the majority of the net proceeds have already been deployed to do share repurchases through a combination of privately negotiated and open market transaction as well as through 170 million asr during the quarter we repurchased 10 3 million shares at a cost of 202 million 1 million of these shares were purchased on the open market prior to the planning and execution of the convertible bond transaction of the remaining 9 3 million shares 4 2 million shares were repurchased through privately negotiated and open market transactions and 5 1 million shares have already been delivered to us against the asr with the balance expected to be delivered after the completion of the asr by the end of the third quarter of this year we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 113 million compared to last year s 232 million cash less debt at the end of the quarter was negative 210 million compared to 192 million last year moving onto the guidance i should point out that our outlook for the second quarter and full year of fiscal 2020 does not assume any asset impairment charges or any potential impact from the list 4 tariff increase on apparel and footwear imported from the into the us from china and mexico also guidance for revenues and comp sales for the total company and by segment is included in the supplemental table attached to our earnings release for the second quarter fiscal 2020 we expect revenues for the quarter to be up 7 to 8 in constant currency at prevailing exchange rates we estimate that currency will be roughly a 3 percentage point headwind on consolidated revenue growth for the quarter our gross margin is expected to be up primarily due to imu improvement from our supply chain initiatives the sg a rate is expected to be up compared to last year primarily due to an increased investment in advertising as well as continued deleverage in asia we are planning an operating margin for the quarter between 4 5 and 5 with a 20 basis point unfavorable impact form currency the adjusted earnings per share is planned in the range of 0 27 per share and 0 30 per share including 0 02 of headwind due to currency the earnings per share guidance includes 0 03 in accretion due to the impact of the convert transaction and share repurchases our adjusted eps guidance includes an assumption of 1 7 million of cash interest expense and amortization of loan fees related to the convertible debt transaction our tax rate for the quarter is estimated to be 25 we expect consolidated revenues for the year to be up between 6 and 7 in constant currency at prevailing exchange rates we estimate currency to have a 2 5 negative impact on consolidated revenue growth for the year for the full year we expect gross margins to be up due to improved imus in both the americas and europe as well as lower logistics and distribution costs in europe the adjusted sg a rate is expected to be up for the year due to an increase in investment in advertising as well as performance based compensation our adjusted tax rate for the year is estimated to be 25 we are planning an adjusted operating margin between 4 8 and 5 2 with minimal currency impact on operating margin and our guidance assumes that foreign currencies will remain roughly at prevailing rates adjusted earnings per share is planned in the range of 1 19 and 1 30 with a 0 03 headwind from currency this includes 0 10 in its estimated accretion due to the share repurchases and convert transactions our adjusted eps guidance includes an assumption of 5 3 million of cash interest and loan amortization expense as a reminder our prior guidance for the year was 1 09 to 1 21 with the currency tailwind of 0 02 the high end of our new guidance now represents a 33 increase over last year s adjusted eps capex for the year is expected to range from 55 million to 65 million to support store openings key store remodels and investments in our technology infrastructure to support long term growth please note that this is down from 108 million in the prior year the lower capex combined with our inventory and working capital management focus are expected to generate improved free cash flow this year even after considering the 46 million eu commission fine payment we made in the first quarter the board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend of 11 25 per share payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on june 19th 2019 with that i will conclude the company s remarks and open the call up for your questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and our first question comes from susan anderson from b riley fbr your line is now open susan anderson b riley fbr analyst hi good evening thanks so much for taking my question i was wondering if you can maybe carlos alberini chief executive officer yes hi susan susan anderson b riley fbr analyst talk about the guidance hi given just the inflection in the back half with a lower guidance in the second quarter maybe if you could kind of talk about by region where you re expecting kind of the acceleration to come from as we look out to the back half thanks sandeep reddy chief financial officer hi susan this is sandeep so i think you re right i mean i think with the performance that we ve had in the first quarter and the guidance that we re providing for the second quarter clearly to see the margin expansion in the year there s going to be some improvement in the back half and what i would take you to is i think from an underlying perspective the americas business and the european business is expected to continue being very strong all year and the only business where i think we ve seen some softness really is the asia business where we ve definitely taken the numbers down relative to what we talked about last time but i think if you think about the full year guidance the most material impact that we would see is really in the fourth quarter but last year we had some pretty material inventory charges because of the level of excess inventory we were carrying so as we lapped that that should be a help to actually have margin expansion during the back half of the year and that s what s embedded in the guidance for the full year susan anderson b riley fbr analyst got it that s helpful and then maybe just a follow up on asia it seems like there s just really weakness across all of the countries there i guess is it more is it is there anything more than just macro going on there i guess in terms of product acceptance and then also it looks like that you re expecting some improvement in the back half so maybe just talk about what s going to be driving that thanks carlos alberini chief executive officer yeah susan this is carlos hello i asia is definitely showing some softening as i said in my prepared remarks and the softening as you suggested has impacted those three big markets for us we do not think that this is brand specific frankly when we see the driver of that softening is primarily customer traffic both coming into our stores and visiting websites so we believe that this is probably goes beyond what is specific to us obviously it s very difficult to speculate what is that is driving that there are some comments from people saying well just the trade war may be having an impact definitely the government has made some changes and significant moves in china specifically to motivate the consumer to continue to spend they have done some things with vat reducing the rates for companies from 13 from 16 to 13 so there is some sign that definitely there is incentives going on to try to really reenergize the economy but it will be very speculative for us to say oh that s what it is we have seen that in most cases the traffic is definitely what s driving the changes and this slowdown now that being said we plan to continue to do what we can control which is thinking about product we are doing a lot of things globally to improve product and that includes from penetration trying to emphasize denim assortment as we said during our last call we are also putting a lot of effort into customer centricity initiatives and that this again our global initiatives our team in china specifically has done a great job in growing the crm database and we feel that there are opportunities to continue to do that effectively we have seen also an opportunity with tmall and of course we are talking to that team to benefit from those opportunities as well and then last but not least is inventory last year we had a major issue with inventories especially in the fourth quarter we had a significant access that we are trying to work through and we are doing that effectively but we feel that with the changes and with that excess inventory we really miss some opportunities especially in china and we think that we can do a better job in flowing inventory and having the right product at the right time in the right place and that is it s a it was tall order but we think that we have the tools to be able to do that much more effectively going forward sandeep reddy chief financial officer and susan just to susan anderson b riley fbr analyst got it sandeep reddy chief financial officer add to your last question on the guidance and the back half improvement one thing that s going to be happening this year the chinese new year is going to land earlier than last year and that benefit is embedded in our guidance and that s why in the front half we are really looking at down low double digits in constant currency and the full year is down high single digits and embedded in that it s a resumption of earlier chinese new year carlos alberini chief executive officer let me come back just i have talked quite a bit about china but i think another area that is it s worth pointing out is about japan s performance we were up against a phenomenal performance of for the first quarter of a year ago in japan and we did expect that we were not going to be able to comp those kind of numbers and sure enough that did happen and some people may look at this and say wow that s a disappointment that you couldn t comp i look at it as a great opportunity honestly because we now know what we need to do to win in that market and the way we won last year was remarkable it was a collaboration that we did with a group called generations and we think that in the past these kind of events and collaborations were more tests to prove a concept i feel that now we have the concepts proved and we have proven those time and time again we had a list of successes doing this kind of collaborations and we feel that this is going to be part of our business model going forward so in a way it has been somewhat painful to the numbers and the financial performance this quarter but i think that those kind of examples are very inspiring to to really pave a new path into how we build a business going forward especially attracting that younger consumer that we keep talking about susan anderson b riley fbr analyst got it that s very helpful and then just really quick on the inventory front are you guys still expecting i guess china and europe the excess to be cleaned up by the back half maybe if you just talk about kind of how much has been cleaned up so far and kind of where you re at with that thanks carlos alberini chief executive officer yeah so let me just start with that i am very impressed with our teams and i say teams because i think that this required an effort across different channels and across different regions to really address this issue and i think we have made great progress and when we look at our forecast and we are now running the company with forecasts in mind as opposed to looking at a rear view mirror and being much more actively looking at what s coming as opposed to what has been and i think when we look at how we think about turning the over the year the year end the numbers are very compelling so i feel that we are in great shape regardless inventory susan anderson b riley fbr analyst great thanks so much very helpful sandeep reddy chief financial officer and susan just to follow up on your question on timing of when we re going to work through it i think already in q1 there was a bit of a sequential improvement to where we finished up in q4 but we still have more work to do the material improvement will come in the back half but i think we you can expect to see sequential improvement as we go along susan anderson b riley fbr analyst great thanks so much good luck next quarter sandeep reddy chief financial officer thank you carlos alberini chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from omar saad from evercore isi your line is now open westcott rochette evercore isi analyst hi guys this is westcott on for omar first we just want to say congratulations and welcome we look forward to working with you carlos big picture kind of question carlos alberini chief executive officer thank you hi westcott rochette evercore isi analyst in terms of your capital allocation thinking about your store base your real estate with your digital as you kind of assess where you are in the us and europe are you looking to continue to expand the store expansion policy particularly in europe and how do you think about the balance over the next three years to four years of your store and store expansion policy versus pushing more aggressively in your digital carlos alberini chief executive officer yes thank you as i said we opened many many stores in both europe and asia during the last few years and we feel that we have a big opportunity to improve productivity in a lot of the new space but that being said we continue to see a lot of open wide space in multiple territories some of them we are in some of them we are not in and i think china s a great example of that we are in 34 of the top 60 cities but those 60 cities have more than one million people each so the opportunity here is tremendous and we are going to be very opportunistic and very careful with the way we look at expansion and how we address new store so we have no plans to stop store expansion here ph and that being said there is a big opportunity on digital but we don t see and i want to come back to table some of this answers to when we are ready to talk to you about our strategic planning process but we for now i don t see that getting all those or perfecting that omni channel experience that i have been talking about is going to be an initiative that is going to require huge amounts of capital so and that capital can take different forms in some cases maybe capex but in many other cases could be just partnering with companies that do this type of work through subscription models and that could be part of our operating expense structure westcott rochette evercore isi analyst okay that s great thank you and a question on europe it sounds like you are increasing your wholesale door partners is that a new strategy or is that something can you talk about how you re approaching the expansion of your wholesale partners in that market and maybe in other markets as well sandeep reddy chief financial officer so westcott this is sandeep so i think the story goes back about seven years or eight years because if you remember the sovereign debt crisis back in 2011 12 when there was a significant contraction in the wholesale distribution we lost a lot of doors especially in southern europe and over the last few years i mean we ve had five consecutive seasons of double digit growth the most of the growth in the first few of those seasons first three four of those seasons was actually coming from increased productivity again in the existing doors that we had but gradually as the health of the business is improving in the southern european countries especially we are now seeing opportunities to go into incremental those as well and broaden our distribution and recapture some of the distribution points that we had in the past as well and that s really what s going on right now we re still probably down a bit versus that peak but we re making progress toward getting back there carlos alberini chief executive officer and i just want to add that i think that this is a testimony to how strong the brand is in all over europe because this kind of appetite for more distribution only happens when the brand is super strong and the product is absolutely right for the markets and we are seeing that across the board and especially in europe westcott rochette evercore isi analyst great that s awesome and just one technical question on china and mexico have you updated or could you update your sourcing exposure to those two markets at this point carlos alberini chief executive officer yeah we are i mean we are doing basically what you have been hearing in the market we are working very actively on this and we are managing the situation the best we can shifting sourcing out of china as fast as we can sharing the impact of tariffs with vendors we are we have very strong relationships that go back many many years and in some cases these vendors have some other places where they are doing business so we are looking into placing the production with them in other places shipping products earlier we have been trying to really stay ahead of this issue and in many cases the vendors were able to react identifying opportunities to adjust prices we are looking at all pricing throughout and we see opportunities where we can adjust prices of course we want to be very careful with this because at the end of the day we don t want to impact demand but we do see pockets of opportunities depending on product categories and then overall just looking at cost savings opportunity across the board we are we engaged a firm that is helping us with the cost reduction opportunities and we are looking at multiple areas within the company we started with north america first and after this we re going to europe with this same type of program so overall just in the case of mexico the numbers are very small but we are also looking at mitigating exposure there as well westcott rochette evercore isi analyst okay and i think a couple of years ago last number i had was 47 was referenced can you give a ballpark roughly what the china exposure is carlos alberini chief executive officer yes sandeep reddy chief financial officer yeah so i think westcott as carlos mentioned it s a very fluid situation because we re actively working on making a number of changes as we go along so i don t think we re going to get into an update at this time but i think we re working on this process actively westcott rochette evercore isi analyst okay well thank you very much good luck guys carlos alberini chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from john kernan from cowen company your line is now open john kernan cowen company analyst good afternoon carlos and sandeep thanks for taking my question and carlos congrats on your first the 100 days back i guess carlos alberini chief executive officer thank you john kernan cowen company analyst so you ve been busy so you talked about assessing the cost structure particularly in americas and europe you were a big part of guess when the operating margin structure was significantly higher than it is now obviously the world has changed a lot since then but what do you think are the biggest opportunities in the cost structure because both in europe and in north america and what do you think a normalized operating margin structure looks like for this business carlos alberini chief executive officer yeah i mean we have talked about pursuing a double digit operating margin for the company in medium to long term so obviously we haven t lost that goal for the company and again this is more like a medium to long term discussion and i would like to address that when we come back after the summer after we have the opportunity to complete our work but that being said john this group that started doing this assessment are already looking at things and we see opportunities in labor scheduling structures for example and of course because we have so many stores we think that this can be a massive opportunity in terms of payroll in the stores and the whole idea here is not necessarily to spend less but to reallocate how we are spending money so it could be that that right now we have x number of hours that are dedicated throughout the day in an even way instead of allocating hours following the traffic patterns into the store so that just to give you an idea i have done this kind of work in my prior experiences and with great success so that s one area there is definitely in americas we see opportunities in sourcing and production as well we see opportunities in the whole corporate indirect expense we see opportunities in distribution and logistics though they are not that huge but i m sure that when we go to europe business given even before we do any assessment we know that the distribution and logistics opportunity in europe is very significant even just comparing to what we used to spend versus what we are currently spending to support the business and even comparing that level of spend to best in class in the industry to support a business of our size so i am very encouraged with the preliminary findings and i think that we re going to be very happy with what it does ph going through and executing on this plan john kernan cowen company analyst excellent thanks europe has had some pressures from the dc in terms of profitability and margins you did recover a little bit this quarter but we re still far below where we were a couple of years ago given some of the cost pressures there and how should we think about that piece the margin recovery just the distributions and logistics as that dc in benelux gets going sandeep reddy chief financial officer so john this is sandeep so i think if you look at this particular quarter we actually improved by 210 basis points and if my memory serves me right this is the first time in about six quarters that margins have actually gone the other way and and the interesting thing about this was this particular quarter the margin improvement really came from imu and leverage from positive comps for the most part a little bit from markdowns as well but i think those were the main drivers and for the year we ve already said previously that we expect at least 100 basis points of margin improvement from the logistics cost and the distribution center so i think obviously you can see that that s not the the logistics cost is not the only driver of margin expansion given how we started the started the year and the first quarter so we definitely expect to see margin recovery and improvement this year including the logistics improvement that we talked about carlos alberini chief executive officer and i think we talked about double digit margins for europe right sandeep reddy chief financial officer yeah exactly i think longer term the low double digit margin goal that we gave is there it s still definitely within reach and we won that far away from it a couple of years ago so i think as we recovered the logistics cost pressures that we re dealing with we re going to get there in a reasonably quick timeframe carlos alberini chief executive officer yeah and i want to add that remember last year in the fourth quarter we had to face the excess inventory issues that impacted not only asia but also europe and we feel that we are very well positioned to recapture that margin that we lost last year or this year so i think all that contributes to margin enhancement and last but not least the whole e commerce business you know even when that business is growing at a faster rate than the rest of the business and we are very happy with that we see a big opportunity as the business gets bigger to expand margins for e comm as well so there is multiple opportunities i think in europe to really expand operating margins john kernan cowen company analyst got it very helpful sandeep just a follow up to your comment imu has been a source of upside to the gross margin what stage are we in in terms of that being a benefit to gross margin going forward i know you ve done some things throughout the supply chain to bring that to improve the imu so just wondering how far into that improvement are we sandeep reddy chief financial officer i think we re really pleased with the progress that we ve made on the imu front over the last couple of years and you ve we ve included that in our guidance for this year as well and we re very happy with the progress that the team has made and i think it s going to be an effort that we continue to make as we go forward carlos mentioned sourcing and production as areas that we ll continue to look at responses ph out of the cost improvement initiatives so that process doesn t stop but i think as far as we re concerned we re always going to keep on focusing on making those improvements as we go along carlos alberini chief executive officer let me just add one more comment here i think that the just looking at what has been done i think that the company did an extraordinary job in improving imu during the last two years or three years but everything was done through some strategic repositioning of sourcing like taking a program from here and putting it over there and which i think is great and as a result we got the improved costing but i think that we now can look at a second level of reposition and that is by combining vendor basis between what we do here in america and what we do in europe those two areas are basically operating somewhat independently and we see a big opportunity when we start looking at our global platform that does sourcing and production together and now leverages vendor relations in a much at a much higher level and plans just production with a lot more foresight and secures capacity with those vendors and does fabric platforming so all these are kind of like a next level of operating efficiencies for us to really capitalize on that and continue to see improvements on imu ultimately john kernan cowen company analyst got it carlos alberini chief executive officer and we re working on that john kernan cowen company analyst thank you best of luck guys sandeep reddy chief financial officer thank you carlos alberini chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from dana telsey from telsey advisory group your line is now open dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst good afternoon everyone can you take us through carlos alberini chief executive officer hi dana dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst hi carlos can you take us through a little bit more about tariffs how you re thinking about it what it means whether it s china mexico and how you are planning and then also the wholesale business in the us seem to have done very well what are you seeing there in particular that s driving that strength thank you carlos alberini chief executive officer yeah dana we just addressed tariffs and really i m afraid that there isn t that much more new that i can tell you i mean just we as i said we are managing this very actively actually i am personally involved with this issues i m going to be in hong kong next week meeting with vendors with a whole team i mean we are doing everything here and i m excited because it will be my first opportunity to meet our entire current vendor base so i m afraid that i can t tell you more obviously we as we this is a moving target so just we are placing buys for or production orders for a holiday now and there are opportunities to really move a lot of that those orders into other places so this is good timing for us or for me to be involved with respect to wholesale we couldn t be more excited about this i mean wholesale the wholesale business here is a growing business we have very nice margins and frankly we think that we are just getting started we have with this generation z move we are seeing that retailers that in the past wouldn t have even considered us they are super excited to do a lot of business with us and just two great examples are urban outfitters and pacific sunwear and we have developed a very nice business with both of them and they are super happy and they want to continue to expand the relationship but also as the product has performed extremely well in the 90s as well so even the our traditional wholesale base is also doing very well with our brand and just i have to tell you we just did a pop up in fred segal who would have thought that guess was going to be represented in fred segal you know just that is a type of store that normally would only take luxury type of brands so so we are very excited about the wholesale business and we think that there is a lot more that we can do even just thinking about exclusives and thinking about how we really leverage these relationships that we have with on partnerships with key celebrities the whole idea with jennifer lopez is is something that our retail partners are also super excited about she s such a huge personality and so well known all over the world and so relevant for our customer our latino customers is a big it represents a big part of our customer base so having somebody like that representing the brands is just awesome dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst and then just on the expense side carlos or sandeep as you think about the deleverage of expenses in asia how are you thinking about that for the remainder of the year and carlos you mentioned more cost reductions to come using data analytics when do we see that how big an opportunity is that in size or what it could mean to the bottom line thank you sandeep reddy chief financial officer so so dana i ll take the first part definitely on the deleverage in asia i think that was the major driver of the first quarter expense deleverage and i think as we go into the second quarter that s another expected driver again of the deleverage and i think the problem we ve had is that the decline in comps has been very steep in the first quarter and second quarter and a big inflection versus where things were trending throughout last year so we re taking actions to address the cost structure but i think in terms of speed in which is going to happen within asia it s probably going to be it s going to be a little bit slow relative to the amount of comp degradation that we are anticipating in the guidance so the pressure is expected to be there within asia from a deleverage standpoint but i think from a cost opportunity across the company the total company there are a number of things that we re working on and i think carlos will touch on that carlos alberini chief executive officer yeah i think and it s not just cost reductions when we talk about data analytics i talk about just making sure that we use customer data in the right way to perfect personalized marketing which is something that we will be working on and we are already doing some testing there is also a lot that we can do on allocation and fulfillment and we are talking to a company that again i have used in the past to really optimize how we place inventory and where we place it and how we fulfill we have opportunities in logistics and distribution frankly this is huge both in north america and in europe to use data to do a better job in the way we service the business so there are i mean right now artificial intelligence and machine learning is like a big thing to be able to do a better job and become more efficient and we are trying to really partner up with people that have done this very successfully to just bring those benefits into the company so it s tough right now to size how big that opportunity is but i can tell you dana this is very meaningful and very significant dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst thank you carlos alberini chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from janet kloppenburg from jjk research associates incorporated your line is now open janet kloppenburg jjk research associates incorporated analyst hey carlos carlos alberini chief executive officer hi janet kloppenburg jjk research associates incorporated analyst it sounds like you put a great plan together it sounds very exciting carlos alberini chief executive officer thank you hi janet janet kloppenburg jjk research associates incorporated analyst just wondering maybe you could elaborate a little bit on this comparison in asia i guess you had a collaboration last year how long will that comparison continue that collaboration what tale does it have and i know your guidance on comps in asia for the second quarter but do you expect that there is some opportunity for comps to inflect in asia in the second half of the year and secondly in terms of the operating margin improvement i know you ve talked a lot about cost reduction but i wonder as you analyze the productivity historical productivity of the store base if perhaps that is an equal or greater opportunity to drive productivity there and and boost the operating margins perhaps you could talk about that thank you carlos alberini chief executive officer yeah let me start with your second question janet and then sandeep maybe he can talk about the comps with the history so i completely agree with you janet frankly when we look at how we can become more profitable in the company cost reductions obviously are a very compelling opportunity for us but more compelling is the whole productivity opportunity and our sales per square foot in the americas has has declined very significantly over the last few years and is turning for the better in the last maybe four quarters but that being said we are not where we want to be not even close and i think that for me that it starts with product and this is going back to those product categories that the company was always very strong at like denim like handbags like accessories the men s business is doing pretty well but we see more opportunity with that so just if we can really perfect the product we have a much better opportunity to increase productivity and with that because we own the stores we own the fixed cost structure we can make a lot more money our margins are very nice frankly i don t think that the product margins are an issue here obviously maybe we ll have some opportunities and i maybe as we said earlier but ultimately the big thing here is to do more with less just create an opportunity for higher productivity and the same thing is true in europe especially with the new stores because there has been all these new stores that are operating very well and pretty much in line with the original expectations when those stores were opened but the productivity is lower than the comp base so we see opportunities there as well so just i couldn t agree with you more but part of the issue here too is to put the product in the right place right at the right time similar to what i was saying about allocation and planning just how we use the inventory in those stores is also important and do you want to take the comps sandeep reddy chief financial officer yeah sure and janet kloppenburg jjk research associates incorporated analyst just one question carlos do you think that the tools that you have to manage that inventory and the data analytics that you re talking about how soon or effective could those tools become in driving productivity carlos alberini chief executive officer yeah no the tools are not here i mean we are i mean we have some tools of course we have planning and allocation systems but what i m talking about it would take some time but most of these applications sit on top of our it infrastructure so it s not something that we are talking about going and implementing sap here it s more about bringing these applications that sit on top of what we already have so the implementation time is significantly shorter so we re talking about just i think we re not going to see much of this this year but definitely next year for sure janet kloppenburg jjk research associates incorporated analyst thank you sandeep reddy chief financial officer so janet janet kloppenburg jjk research associates incorporated analyst multiple speakers yeah sandeep reddy chief financial officer yeah janet this is me ph sandeep how are you doing janet kloppenburg jjk research associates incorporated analyst all right hi sandeep sandeep reddy chief financial officer so janet i think your question was really on i think specifically about the partnership that we had in the first quarter last year that actually had a big impact on us on comps that was in japan it was with the generations band and that actually started off in the first quarter and actually spilled into the second quarter as well so there is an impact both in q1 and q2 and i think when you look at the full year guidance we actually got some improvement baked in in the back half because our full year guidance is down to the high single digits even though the front half is down low double digits and i think but that s mostly driven by the timing of chinese new year because chinese new year is going to be earlier this year than last year and that s going to benefit the fourth quarter so i think that s really the high level of the guidance cadence for asia janet kloppenburg jjk research associates incorporated analyst okay thank you so much carlos alberini chief executive officer thank you janet sandeep reddy chief financial officer thank you i think this is probably the last caller question we could take because we re running out of time so operator operator and we have no further questions in queue at this time i ll turn the call back to carlos for closing remarks carlos alberini chief executive officer thank you well thank you all for joining us today i believe that we have tremendous opportunities as a company so i think we can deliver significant shareholder value and we remain highly committed here to optimizing the business and we want to drive strong revenue growth healthy profit expansion and we think that we are well positioned to do so so we look forward to sharing with you our strategic business plan as we said at the end of the summer thanks again for participating and have a great rest of the week and weekend thank you so much operator thank you ladies and

the re monetization of gold in part one yesterday nick giambruno gave us four reasons that explain why this surge is imminent and today he has four more that make the case for why you should add gold to your holdings sooner rather than later yesterday i laid out four reasons for why this gold rally will be bigger than anything we ve ever seen i explained how central banks are buying up piles of gold how china is using the metal to remove its dependence on the u s dollar and why the fed s shifting strategy is bullish for the sector today i d like to dive deeper into what s going to trigger this revival no 5 takeover frenzy in the gold mining industry 2019 is on track to be a record breaking year for gold mergers and acquisitions m a the world s largest mining companies are pouring billions of dollars into mergers and acquisitions three blockbuster deals contributed to this result newmont mining completed a 10 billion takeover of goldcorp on april 18 barrick gold acquired randgold resources in a 6 billion transaction that closed on january 1 barrick gold has also announced a joint venture with newmont after a hostile bid from barrick failed barrick and newmont are the top two gold producing companies in the world the joint venture in nevada will create the largest gold producing complex in the world what these mega deals prove is that the biggest companies in gold mining think gold and gold stocks are cheap they show a preference to grow by buying out other companies rather than discovering and developing new resources if this trend continues 2019 will go down as a record breaking year for gold m as it s another major tailwind for gold no 6 president trump is pro gold president trump is a big fan of gold for one he s made a killing as a gold investor he s called investing in gold easier than the construction business but trump s affinity for gold goes much deeper he once said the legacy of gold as a precious commodity has transcended to become a viable currency and an accepted universal monetary standard central banks around the world are holding gold as a reserve asset and trump is a fan of the gold standard in other words the re monetization of gold while running for president he said bringing back the gold standard would be very hard to do but boy would it be wonderful we d have a standard on which to base our money and he s acting on his pro gold instincts in a big way let me explain trump has been able to wield more influence over the federal reserve than any other president since the fed was created in 1913 he s had the chance to fill five out of the seven seats on the board of governors of the federal reserve in other words trump gets to stack over 70 of the whole fed board with people of his choosing and so far he s nominated several pro gold candidates including herman cain and stephen moore they re both on record as supporting a gold standard for example in 2012 when cain was running for president he wrote an editorial for the wall street journal titled we need a dollar as good as gold he wrote gold is kryptonite to big spending politicians it is to the moochers and looters in government what sunlight and garlic are to vampires cain and moore have since withdrawn their nominations but one replacement is widely suspected to be judy shelton who is also an advocate of the gold standard regardless the fact that trump nominated them in the first place shows he is willing to act on his pro gold instincts here s the bottom line having a u s president who favors gold and is looking to stack the fed with pro gold people is unprecedented in recent history it s a positive development for gold and the trend of gold s re monetization but gold is going to get a boost no matter which party is in power no 7 socialism is on the rise socialism is on the rise in the u s and it s about to be entrenched in u s politics a recent poll from the victims of communism memorial foundation a d c based nonprofit showed that one in two millennials now favors socialism and communism over capitalism it s why bernie sanders elizabeth warren kamala harris alexandria ocasio cortez aoc and other socialists are skyrocketing in popularity this is no small problem millennials are now the largest demographic group in america and sometime this year they are expected to surpass baby boomers as the nation s largest living adult generation in other words demographics alone guarantee more socialism ahead and as we ve seen again and again when asked how are you going to pay for this socialists have the same answer tax the rich simple arithmetic shows that even if the rich were taxed to the limit it wouldn t put a dent in the bills for the socialists government programs but to this the socialists respond we ll just print money in comes modern monetary theory mmt it s the latest buzzword coming out of washington d c contrary to its name mmt is neither new nor modern and adding the word theory to something doesn t make it scientific or credible mmt is the same economic quackery that s brought misery to argentina venezuela zimbabwe and countless other places now left leaning u s economists politicians and policy wonks are taking it seriously too they see it as a sort of qe for the people for example aoc and stephanie kelton bernie sanders former chief economic adviser are leading advocates of mmt in short america s embrace of socialism will lead to more money printing and currency debasement just as it has everywhere else it s been tried but this time it won t be the argentine peso or the venezuelan bolívar that is debased it will be the u s dollar the world s premier reserve currency gold is the primary competitor for the u s dollar s top role and as the american socialists inflate the value of the dollar away it will make gold all that more attractive that s why this trend will be a big positive for the re monetization of gold no 8 gold backed cryptos a monetary revolution the last catalyst for gold is cryptocurrencies backed by gold there are dozens of gold backed cryptos sprouting up peter grosskopf the ceo of sprott recently called gold backed cryptocurrencies the most important thing to happen to the gold market in the last several decades soon after sprott launched a gold backed crypto it developed with its partners when sprott a leader in the natural resources industry makes a big move into the gold backed crypto space it s a definitive sign of where things are headed gold backed cryptos combine the best attributes of gold and cryptos i can t think of two other asset classes that have as many synergies in other words the whole is worth much more than the sum of the parts with cryptos redeemable for gold we can now instantly send anyone anywhere in the world small or large amounts of gold reliably and without interference it s nothing short of a monetary revolution gold backed cryptos are going to make using gold as money even more convenient for the average person and business anyone with a cell phone now can use gold in a way that was not possible before this is another big reason why i think gold is coming back as money putting it all together when you take a step back and look at the big picture the implications for gold are clear basel iii moves gold toward officially being money again central banks are buying record amounts of gold excessive u s sanctions have pushed countries to use gold china s golden alternative allows for large scale oil for gold trades the fed s dramatic reversal and the return of easy money bode well for gold s strength against the dollar the takeover frenzy in the gold mining industry is bullish for the price of gold president trump favors returning to the gold standard and is stacking the fed with pro gold people the democrats embrace of socialism guarantees more currency debasement gold backed cryptos make owning and using gold easier than ever any one of these catalysts alone would be great news for gold but the fact they are all converging at the same time means an epic gold bull market is on the menu for 2019 and the time to get positioned is now please

by reuters by ross finley london reuters the synchronised global economic expansion cheered on by investors who pushed wall street stocks to a record high last month has started to sour and is increasingly at risk from a developing trade war between the world s two largest economies a group of several hundred economists and financial market professionals regularly polled by reuters over the past few years has consistently and almost unanimously warned that trade conflict is the number one global economic risk central bankers and finance ministers from the g20 countries will have this to contemplate as they meet over the weekend in fukuoka japan under the long shadow of the america first policy pursued by their still dominant member as the u s china trade war has dragged on and evidence piles up that trade volumes are taking a knock those warnings seem all the more prescient federal reserve chair jerome powell appears to have come round to a similar view if market bets are even remotely correct the fed which just months ago looked set to hike interest rates several times this year may be only months away from following several other important world central banks like australia s and new zealand s in cutting rates j p morgan one of the largest u s banks is already forecasting two fed rate cuts this year but is casting that essentially as a successful insurance policy with very modest changes to their outlook for global growth next year for her part christine lagarde head of the international monetary fund told reuters recently that the u s china trade war will not cause a global recession but that the trade spat amounted to self inflicted wounds the problem is it s ongoing and until it stops there is no way to accurately forecast what will happen next nor can one really predict what goes on in the minds of the world s company executives with respect to future investment decisions citi economists are among those who have tried and what they foresaw was not pretty recent developments remain consistent with our long held view that trade tensions have not peaked and are expected to continue with and beyond china wrote citi economist cesar rojas in a client note amid a relative balance between domestic resilience and external headwinds a metastasized global trade war would likely trigger a cascade of economic and financial reactions that would tip the global economy into a growth recession he wrote make no mistake the united states which has easily outperformed its peers is still growing reasonably strongly with the latest read on its vast non manufacturing industries which make up the bulk of production topping expectations but private sector economists most of whom are still chastised by the market for missing the last u s recession see a significant 40 percent chance of a slump in the next two years even the mighty u s dollar is catching a whiff of it on a shorter time horizon past experience shows once a recession probability gets consistently that high in economists minds which are tempered by other things like what s good for business there is a good chance it has already started policymakers of course can ease their language and cut interest rates but they rarely forecast economic slumps doing so is counterproductive in setting policy aimed at supporting economies one of their unwritten roles is to cheerlead their main role in most cases is to manage inflation advertisement yet apart from rampant asset price inflation in the decade since the great recession and a sprinkling of wage inflation as the u s jobless rate plumbs half century lows there has been acceleration in little else that last point was underscored at the european central bank s news conference on thursday where it again extended its view on how long rates are likely to remain unchanged to mid 2020 inflation expectations have dropped sharply for the u s the euro zone and britain since late last year and consensus forecasts remain below central banks targets for this year and next over the past few months the inflation outlook has been cut with lower lows over the forecast horizon that is all the more remarkable given that in most cases rates in the developed world barely reached what would have been described as neutral neither stimulative nor restrictive before the last financial crisis even the reserve bank of india managing one of the fastest growing economies in the world just delivered a third successive interest rate cut advertisement can we chalk all of this up to central bank success in taming inflation or is it that inflation is being driven by global forces not under their control ecb president mario draghi pointed out on thursday several factors damaging economic sentiment that he can t control including geopolitical uncertainty and of course the rising threat of protectionism additional reporting by hari kishan in bengaluru editing by hugh lawson
when we talk about the top savers among countries we are really talking about which countries have the highest savings rates these are not necessarily the nations with the highest incomes for example a country where the average person makes 10 000 and saves 2 000 would have a 20 savings rate another country where people save 20 000 per year out of 100 000 in income would also have a 20 savings rate furthermore there are also different ways to save people can save directly businesses might save and government agencies may also save the national savings rate incorporates all of these different types of savings as a practical matter this article uses world bank data on gross domestic savings rates and average incomes from 2022 a wide variety of countries have high savings rates and their reasons for saving are as diverse as the countries themselves the list of top savers also changes considerably over time key takeaways the top ten countries by savings rate were djibouti qatar ireland gabon singapore brunei luxembourg the republic of congo zambia and norway there is a connection between economic growth incomes and savings rates oil wealth is also associated with higher savings rates relatively low taxes seem to be another factor in high gross domestic savings rates the top ten savers 1 djibouti 84 9 djibouti is a small nation in the horn of africa according to most recent world bank figures its gross domestic savings rate was 84 9 in 2022 this reflects a significant increase from years prior during which the rate typically hovered between 10 to 20 the country has an average gross domestic product gdp per capita adjusted for purchasing power parity of 5 893 2 qatar 67 7 qatar owes its high savings rate of 67 7 to both its high average income of about 114 049 in purchasing power parity terms and its oil exports furthermore the qatari riyal has a fixed exchange rate with the u s dollar which is common among middle eastern countries 3 ireland 64 1 ireland s gross domestic savings of 64 1 of gdp is impressive even given the country s high gdp per capita of about 126 837 adjusting for purchasing power parity ireland s high savings rate is also partially a response to the european sovereign debt crisis 4 gabon 60 3 gabon is an african country with significant oil exports gabon s oil plays a large role in both the country s gross domestic savings rate of 60 3 of gdp and average income of around 16 465 in purchasing power parity terms which is much higher than its neighbors 5 singapore 60 1 singapore has a gross domestic savings rate of 60 1 that comes out of average incomes of around 127 606 adjusting for purchasing power parity much of the credit goes to the country s rapid industrialization in the 1960s manufacturing drove growth and singapore along with the other tiger economies of hong kong south korea and taiwan achieved full employment 6 brunei 56 6 brunei is a small oil rich country located near indonesia and malaysia brunei has an average income of around 69 297 in purchasing power parity terms which supports a high savings rate of 56 6 some of this saving is accomplished by the brunei investment agency which is responsible for managing the nation s sovereign wealth fund swf 7 luxembourg 51 8 luxembourg s high savings rate of 51 8 comes out of a gdp per capita of about 140 616 in purchasing power parity terms luxembourg is a fairly small country but its status as a tax haven within the eurozone supports high savings and high incomes 8 republic of the congo 50 4 the republic of the congo is a relatively small african country with its capital at brazzaville it should not be confused with its much larger neighbor the democratic republic of the congo drc the average gdp per capita adjusted for purchasing power parity in the republic of the congo is about 4 335 compared to 1 337 in the drc the republic of the congo has substantial oil exports which helps explain both its higher income and its higher savings rate than the drc 9 zambia 50 1 zambia is an african country with a gdp per capita of about 3 975 adjusting for purchasing power parity it s resource rich and its economy is supported by high demand and prices for cooper a major export 10 norway 50 0 norway s savings rate of 50 0 remains high by global standards in purchasing power parity terms norway s average income came close to 114 929 per year in 2022 among the highest in the world economic growth incomes and savings there is a connection between economic growth incomes and savings rates in the above examples however the exact nature of this relationship is less clear the idea that higher savings lead to more economic growth and higher incomes is intuitively appealing on the other hand personal savings can contribute to recessions according to the paradox of thrift associated with economist john maynard keynes there is a long running debate among economists on the role of savings in economic growth another possible explanation is that as incomes grow people have more money left to save while many countries with high savings rates also have high incomes some of them do not high economic growth rather than high incomes might be a better explanation for high savings rates in some countries suppose you made 10 more each year and saved 70 of that increase your savings rate would gradually converge toward 70 even as you spent 3 more on consumption each year in this way higher growth supports higher consumption and higher savings rates oil and savings oil wealth is also associated with higher savings rates profits from oil exports might support a wealthy elite who are far better able to save governments also sometimes set up sovereign wealth funds to preserve capital for their countries after their oil reserves are exhausted finally a government might sign a long term development deal with one of the big oil companies when such a deal goes through there could be a one time flood of cash into the local economy in such a situation it would be logical to expect the savings rate to increase temporarily taxes and savings relatively low taxes seem to be another factor in high gross domestic savings rates in theory lower taxes should lead to higher returns for savers which would increase the savings rate in practice some of the top savers are actual tax havens while others offer lower taxes than neighboring countries however people with naturally higher savings rates moving to tax havens might play a more important role than increased savings among other residents what is china s savings rate according to latest world bank figures china s gross domestic savings rate was 47 in 2022 which falls on the higher end where does the u s rank in saving money the gross domestic savings rate for the u s in 2022 was 17 1 a figure in the mid range among countries how is gross domestic savings calculated gross domestic savings is calculated by subtracting total consumption from gross domestic product gdp the gross domestic savings rate is calculated by expressing this value as a percentage of gdp the bottom line savings rates vary widely across countries for various reasons including factors such as income low taxes oil wealth foreign investment and more one way that savings are measured is through the gross domestic savings rate according to 2022 world bank data the top ten countries by this metric were djibouti qatar ireland gabon singapore brunei luxembourg the republic of congo zambia and norway

ebitdaoi mr mccarthy said we are pleased to report that operationally we remain on track to deliver those results subject to us winning at least one new contract manufacturing agreement of which several remain in discussion with potential customers capital management business development and legal dr alan bell executive director and chairman of the board said in quarter 1 delivery delays in ordered cmo batches and the lack of technology transfer revenue from a new cmo agreement resulted in revenue delays within the quarter this necessitated a short term cash loan of 700 000 being made to the company from the inside shareholder group the loan was made on terms favorable to the company with the consent of the senior lender marathon to whose debt facility the new loan is subordinated further such loans will be necessary during quarter 2 to accommodate ongoing cash flow needs given the later delivery dates for cmo batches on order from customers dr bell said in quarter 1 of 2019 we continued to identify and work with a range of pharmaceutical companies seeking sterile injectable contract manufacturing or cmo services some of the inquiries have included a product development component and we have brought to bear our wider capabilities in product design regulatory experience and market knowledge to those potential projects while numerous discussions are ongoing and remain promising none of the identified opportunities had progressed to contract by the end of quarter 1 as communicated in our public release of april 11 2019 our financial results would be adversely affected and impact our 2019 guidance should at least one such project not proceed to contract as previously announced we have ceased investment in the global zydax canine project which will not be

progress on several fronts seeking to satisfy the technical requirements for the next milestone payment under the agreement with our multinational collaborator further public announcements are subject to confidentiality under the agreement dr bell stated litigation begun by a former ceo against the company is being defended and a countersuit has been filed to recover substantial shareholder funds

increased government regulatory fees year on year administration expenses increased 0 2 million to 1 5 million in 2019 compared to 1 3 million for the same period in 2018 due to slight timing differences in year on year administration expenses finance costs of 2 2 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 increased by 1 1 million over the same period in 2018 due to the difference in

the new facility is substantially lower over the term other income expense for the three months ended march 31 2019 was an expense of 0 2 million compared to income of 0 8 million for the same period

overview the implications of president trump s assessment that there has not been nearly enough progress in negotiations with mexico that would avert the tariff on june 10 competing for investors attention minutes before trump spoke fitch cut its sovereign rating for mexico to bbb from bbb while moody s cut its outlook to negative from stable the risk off mood was seen in asia where most equity markets fell though hong kong korean and australian equities advanced indian stocks fell over 1 despite the central bank cutting the repo and reverse repo rates by 25 bp to 5 75 and 5 50 respectively the also fell by more than 1 it was the sixth consecutive decline european markets are faring better and the is extending its advance benchmark 10 year yields are mostly lower italy is underperforming following the eu s warning on the country s debt the u s is off around three basis points to 2 10 the is softer against all of the major currencies but central and eastern european currencies are firmer while the turkish south african and chinese are lower the mexican is stabilizing at lower levels oil prices are stabilizing after yesterday s slide that was spurred by a surge in us inventories 22 mln barrels of crude and fuel is higher for the sixth consecutive session and it has risen for 10 of the past 11 sessions it approached 1345 thursday just shy of the year s high seen in february asia pacific the trade tension with china is not deterring the u s from pursuing policies that will antagonize china further reports suggest the u s is close to striking a 2 bln arms deals with taiwan that include state of the art tanks anti aircraft and anti armor weapons it is not clear whether the f 16 fighter jets will be included in this or a subsequent deal china will protest this but there is little it can do even though the us recognizes that taiwan is a province of the prc aid to venezuela might be part of china s counter but the deteriorating economic prospects have led russia to scale back its military presence as the maduro government cannot afford to pay as much for protection the dollar is trading within range against the jpy107 80 jpy 108 50 it is the first session this week that the greenback has not yet been below jpy108 00 where a 2 8 bln expiring option is struck there are 2 4 bln in options struck at jpy108 25 that also will be cut and 2 1 bln at jpy108 50 the dollar has fallen against the yen for six of the past seven weeks it closed last week near jpy108 30 the reversed lower failing to establish a foothold above 0 7000 however buyers reemerged near 0 6965 but another run at 0 7000 may be difficult ahead of the u s jobs report europe the ecb cannot be happy external risks have not diminished indeed since it met last the risks of a no deal brexit and escalation in trade tensions have increased on top of this price pressures have eased and at 1 2 in may was the lowest in a year about a third of this increase is due to food and energy prices putting the core at 0 8 for all the effort the core rate bottomed at 0 6 in january 2015 the risks are to the downside and the staff forecasts may be tweaked lower the ecb is expected to provide more details about the new loan facility a negative rate associated with the targeted lending would be most beneficial to those banks who have used this facility the most in the past and that is understood to be in the south the market appears to be discounting the chances of a 10 bp rate cut in about a year s time and at least one european bank predicted a resumption of asset purchases next year under a new ecb president germany appears to be gradually improving yesterday the may composite pmi was confirmed at a three month high which was a bit better than the flash estimate today it reported an unexpected increase in april factory orders they were expected to be flat after a 0 6 increase in march instead they rose 0 3 and the march series was revised to show a 0 8 increase that said domestic orders actually fell 0 8 while foreign orders rose 1 1 the posted a key reversal thursday after making new highs for the move trading above 1 13 briefly for the first time since mid april it reversed course and closed below the previous day s low a little below 1 1230 note that the 1 1210 area corresponds to a 50 retracement of the euro s bounce that began in the second half of last week the next retracement 61 8 is found near 1 1190 it languishes in thursday s trough and has not been above 1 1250 there is a roughly 950 mln option struck at 1 1200 that will be cut and another 1 2 bln euros at 1 1220 the euro has typically fallen on days that the ecb has met since the beginning of last year last september and this past april have been exceptions to the rule sterling reversed lower after testing the 20 day moving average 1 2750 for the first time in since may 13 it slipped further but found some bids by 1 2670 the broad dollar direction seems to be the most important consideration now america fitch seemed more concerned about the slowing of the mexican economy and pemex s debt than the u s threat to levy escalating tariff on all imports from mexico fitch s move is important because it is to bring it to bbb moody s which cut its outlook to negative is at a3 a is at the high with s p in the middle at bbb negative outlook the which had stabilized in recent days was hit with this one two punch the dollar quickly jumped from around mxn19 58 to around mxn19 84 recall the high set earlier this week was almost mxn19 61 it is almost as if trump is juggling the continental issues and china his tougher stand against mexico comes as one can expect niceties from mnuchin and the pboc governor who will meet at the g20 finance ministers meeting in japan over the weekend trump seemed more relaxed in the uk about huawei and seemed to offer reassurances that the intelligence relationship would continue the u s position shares with its trade stance a desire to limit quantities the fact that mexico is apprehended nearly double the number of undocumented migrants last month from a year ago is not sufficient if the number of undocumented migrants trying to come into the u s also rises a tariff on mexico hurts trump in three ways first like all tariffs is a tax that the buyer pays movement of goods within u s companies whose operations are on both sides of the border account for as much as 60 of trade it would undermine support from part of his base second such a tariff on mexico would kill the usmca the threat alone is potent third it could lead to congress overruling the president on his use of emergency power and taking back some trade authority this would be the moral equivalent of a censure thursday s news was mixed the disappointed with a lowly 27k increase in private sector jobs but it was offset by the unexpected strength of the which included a big rise in 58 1 from 53 7 and new orders 58 6 from 58 1 the was also mostly upbeat with business outlook solidly positive on the other hand the distress of farmers has increased amid poor weather and lower prices for crops after approaching last month s low cad1 3360 the popped back above cad1 34 it reached cad1 3430 but is coming off in line with the softer tone against the other majors it is difficult for short term participants to have much conviction the u s dollar began the week north of cad1 35 and the upper end of its recent range has frayed the lower end of the range the dollar index recovered after reaching its lowest level since april 12 95 75 however there has been no follow through buying
president donald trump s plan to impose tariffs on mexican exports unless our neighbor does something he hasn t specified what to stop the flow of asylum seekers is almost surely illegal u s trade law gives presidents discretion to impose tariffs for a number of reasons but curbing immigration isn t one of them it s also a clear violation of u s international agreements and it will reduce the living standards of most americans destroy many jobs in u s manufacturing and hurt farmers but let s put all of that to one side and talk about the really bad stuff trump says that tariff is a beautiful word indeed but the actual history of u s tariffs isn t pretty and not just because tariffs whatever the tweeter in chief says are in practice taxes on americans not foreigners in fact it s now a good bet that trump s tariffs will more than wipe out whatever breaks middle class americans got from the 2017 tax cut the more important fact is that until the 1930s tariff policy was a cesspool of corruption and special interest politics one of the main purposes of the 1934 reciprocal trade agreements act which eventually became the template for the modern world trading system was to drain that particular swamp by removing the capriciousness of previous tariff policy trump s erratic trade actions unconstrained by what we used to think were the legal rules have brought the capriciousness back and good old fashioned corruption if it isn t happening already won t be far behind beyond that tariff policy is inextricably linked with the united states role as a global superpower central to that role is the expectation that the u s will be both reliable and responsible that it will honor whatever agreements it makes and more broadly that it will make policy with an eye to the effects of its actions on the rest of the world trump is throwing all that away his mexican tariffs violate both nafta which was supposed to guarantee free movement of goods within north america and our obligations under the world trade organization which like u s law permits new tariffs only under certain specified conditions so america has become a lawless actor in world markets a tariff policy rogue state but there s more by deploying tariffs as a bludgeon against whatever he doesn t like trump is returning america to the kind of irresponsibility it displayed after world war i irresponsibility that while obviously not the sole or even the main cause of the great depression the rise of fascism and the eventual coming of world war ii helped create the environment for these disasters it is pretty widely known that america turned its back on the world after world war i refusing to join the league of nations and slamming the doors shut on most immigration what s less known is that america also took a sharply protectionist turn long before the infamous 1930 smoot hawley act in early 1921 congress enacted the emergency tariff act soon followed by the fordney mccumber tariff of 1922 these actions more than doubled average tariffs on dutiable imports like trump the advocates of these tariffs claimed that they would bring prosperity to all americans they didn t there was indeed a manufacturing boom driven not by tariffs but by new products like affordable cars and new technologies like the assembly line farmers however spent the 1920s suffering from low prices for their products and high prices for farm equipment leading to a surge in foreclosures part of the problem was that u s tariffs were met with retaliation even before the depression struck the world was engaged in a gradually escalating trade war making matters even worse u s tariffs put our world war i allies in an impossible position we expected them to repay their huge war debts but our tariffs made it impossible for them to earn the dollars they needed to make those payments and the trade war debt nexus created a climate of international distrust and bitterness that contributed to the economic and political crises of the 1930s this experience had a profound effect on u s policy after world war ii which was based on the view that free trade and peace went hand in hand so am i saying that trump is repeating the policy errors america made a century ago no this time it s much worse after all while warren harding wasn t a very good president he didn t routinely abrogate international agreements in a fit of pique while america in the 1920s failed to help build international institutions it didn t do a trump and actively try to undermine them and while u s leaders between the wars may have turned a blind eye to the rise of racist dictatorships they generally didn t praise those dictatorships and compare them favorably to democratic regimes there are however enough parallels between u s tariff policy in the 1920s and trumpism today for us to have a pretty good picture of what happens when politicians think that tariffs are beautiful and it s ugly paul krugman is a columnist for the new york times
us china trade war will start a recession or worseâ the logic of donald trump s multi front trade war if there is any is increasingly obscure the tangled mix of policies isn t accomplishing its stated goals and seems unlikely to ever do so meanwhile it hurts the americans it should supposedly help regardless it s happening and it has consequences none of them good the president s latest move to impose escalating tariffs on imports from mexico is the trade equivalent of going nuclear judging by his tweets trump thinks it will solve multiple problems trade drugs immigration and crime that s doubtful at best and as with real nuclear weapons the blast wave isn t going to discriminate it will hit everyone if you think the trade war hasn t affected you yet brace yourself you re about to feel it tariffs will raise prices a tariff is a form of sales tax on imported goods the importer has to give the government cash then it recovers it by charging more accepting lower profit margins or some combination of both so far president trump s tariffs are showing up as higher inflation it s not obvious in the broad inflation measures like the consumer price index because only a few goods have been affected but in those segments the impact is clear goldman sachs recently compared price changes in nine tariff impacted cpi categories vs those that weren t since the first tariffs in 2018 an index of those categories rose more than 3 meanwhile all the other core goods categories showed a slight decline this impact is about to spread the president is raising tariffs on almost all chinese goods and is threatening the same for mexico again we won t necessarily see this in retail prices right away but if we don t it will be only because merchants have stockpiled inventory or decided to absorb the cost out of their profits if it s the latter it s still not good companies with shrinking profit margins usually try to recover them somehow like laying off workers or postponing expansion plans still consumers will certainly notice if the latest tariff increases persist more than a few months top retailers depend on chinese and mexican goods those prices will probably rise this might actually stimulate some activity as people try to avoid tariffs or find substitute goods but mostly we will see it as higher prices and lower disposable incomes but that will only be the beginning trump s plan won t work out remember when politicians actually worried about government debt i know it s been awhile we used to think high debt would cause inflation that hasn t happened for reasons john mauldin explained recently in why debt won t spark inflation essentially debt fueled fiscal stimulus fades quickly to be replaced by weaker business conditions demand falls enough to keep consumer prices and interest rates from rising much if at all tariffs are similar in some ways president trump at least thinks he can make companies move production to the us and hire american workers so stimulating growth that may happen a little bit here and there but it won t be much the business leaders who make those decisions know full well that trump s unilateral tariffs may disappear when he leaves office or maybe sooner if he changes his mind few businesses are going to make major capital investments based on a whim that could change tomorrow so initially we will just get the higher prices then it will be too late in the near future us manufacturers will reduce output because the imported parts on which they depend are too expensive and no alternate sources exist in the us laid off manufacturing workers will tighten their belts and reduce spending hitting the retail sector and possibly making some stores close those workers will lose their jobs too then the same will happen in the farm states as mexico and china shift their once large grain and meat purchases elsewhere by that point president trump may see the light and change his mind but the damage will be done business leaders will have seen what can happen their willingness to take risks and invest in new capacity will be lower then we may see some highly leveraged companies default on loans that never should have been made in the first place lenders will tighten standards and starve even viable companies of financing the fed may try to counteract this with rate cuts or qe but if we ve learned anything the last decade it s that monetary policy no longer has the same effects it used to all this adds up to one thing recession the last straw now we are overdue for recession even without tariffs this historically weak growth cycle has to end eventually if tariffs don t trigger it something else will but tariffs could easily be the last straw this trade war could make the recession happen sooner last longer and cause more pain than it otherwise would what aggravates me most are the people saying we have to accept some pain in order to fix the problems with china first of all there is zero reason to think tariffs will solve the problems so we ll get more pain but little or no gain second those who so want other americans to suffer tend to be wealthy powerful people they won t lose their jobs they have great health insurance and don t have to worry about foreclosure and bill collectors those who actually are suffering will notice this next recession could easily become more than a recession people in pain do radical things and those who caused that pain probably won t like where it leads the great reset the collapse of the biggest bubble in history new york

manufacturing agreement of which several remain in discussion with potential customers capital management business development and legal dr alan bell executive director and chairman of the board said in quarter 1 delivery delays in ordered cmo batches and the lack of technology transfer revenue from a new cmo agreement resulted in revenue delays within the quarter this necessitated a short term cash loan of 700 000 being made to the company from the inside shareholder group the loan was made on terms favorable to the company with the consent of the senior lender marathon to whose debt facility the new loan is subordinated further such loans will be necessary during quarter 2 to accommodate ongoing cash flow needs given the later delivery dates for cmo batches on order from customers dr bell said in quarter 1 of 2019 we continued to identify and work with a range of pharmaceutical companies seeking sterile injectable contract manufacturing or cmo services some of the inquiries have included a product development component and we have brought to bear our wider capabilities in product design regulatory experience and market knowledge to those potential projects while numerous discussions are ongoing and remain promising none of the identified opportunities had progressed to contract by the end of quarter 1 as communicated in our public release of april 11 2019 our financial results would be adversely affected and impact our 2019 guidance should at least one such project not proceed to contract as previously announced we have ceased investment in the

in 2018 gross margin as a percentage of revenue using a cost of goods sold product basis was 83 in 2019 compared to 86 in 2018 due to higher technology transfer revenues recorded in quarter 1 2018

european markets are finishing on a strong note as trade optimism grows as the us china will resume talks for the first time since may 10th and after the ecb adjusted their forward guidance highlighting that several members discussed the possibility of future interest rate cuts if conditions in the eurozone deteriorated us futures are also modestly higher ahead of a highly anticipated non farm payroll report which is expected to show 175 000 jobs were created in may fed rate cut bets could get a boost if we see a big miss with today s job number with the june meeting possibly becoming a live meeting analysts are waiting to see if the adp private payroll report which showed the lowest creation of private sector jobs since march 2010 was the first crack being showed in the strongest part of the us economy the labor market european stocks are green across the board with the cac 40 leading the way higher with a 1 2 gain euro stoxx 50 is up 0 9 while the dax is 0 6 stronger both the dow and s p futures are up 0 3 in early trade gold s rally is taking a breather with prices easing 0 2 while oil benefited from the risk on tone and positive comments from the saudi oil minister dax ecb driven gains limited by very weak numbers out of germany trade mnuchin and yi gang aim to return constructive talks this weekend at g20 oil saudis remain confident cuts will be extended gold shines bright on trade and falling dollar expectations dax the dax is benefitting from the european central bank ecb policy decision that delivered a dovish bias that saw the bank focus more on the global picture and not so much to the eurozone rebound that occurred in q1 today s gains from the dax are slightly underperforming their neighbors as german data on industrial production and exports plunged in april it appears german factories are no longer benefiting from brexit stockpiling and industrial production fell to the a near four year low prompting many to believe first quarter momentum did not carry over with external risks rising in the eurozone german manufacturing remains exposed to possible further weakness on brexit risk and the impending us europe tariff battle if the second quarter continues to disappoint easing will easily be back on the ecb s radar bund yields are slightly higher today by 0 6 basis points to 0 235 but that could be temporary if the markets begin to price in further rate cuts to stimulate domestic demand trade markets are beginning to price in optimism that the us china trade war will see officials resume constructive talks while the battle in the americas will see mexico get hit with tariffs but it could be short lived as progress appears to be headed in the right direction overnight pboc governor yi gang reminded markets that china has ample policy tools if we continue to see trade tensions escalate china has been active already in stimulating the economy and yi gang noted we have plenty of room in interest rates we have plenty of room in required reserve ratio rate this weekend he will hold talks with secretary mnuchin at the g20 finance minister meeting a resumption of talks since may 10th the day president trump rose tariffs on 200 billion in chinese goods to 25 beijing and washington s extended break provided a blow to sentiment that may not easily be repaired even if we do see further progress this weekend markets will only be convinced if we hear constructive comments from both xi and trump with a potential onslaught of fresh easing coming from most of the advanced economies central banks we could see a trade deal be the catalyst needed to help take global equities back to their 2018 highs the mexico and us are making progress with their talks but might not see enough progress for mexican goods to avoid the first round of tariffs on june 10th vice president pence stated that the us will impose 5 tariffs on mexico on monday as planned mexican officials continue to highlight the progress that has been made and markets are starting to believe a sustainable deal is nearing the mexican peso is slightly softer against the dollar this morning oil crude prices were supported by a united stance from the russian and saudi oil ministers and by the overall optimisitc tone that is embracing risk assets the energy ministers suggested the oil production cuts are likely to be continued but that it is not a done deal saudi energy minister al falih said he was sure the opec production cuts would be extended and that the need to calibrate and not deepen cuts novak noted the contaminate crisis that clogged its main export route was almost fixed and that poland will get crude shortly russia was the first country to suggest moving the opec and allies meeting and a date has still yet to be agreed upon novak stated that most countries agree on july 2nd to 4th west texas intermediate crude found major support from the 50 00 a barrel level and could see further bullish momentum if we see something constructive out of the g20 talks this weekend if the fed cuts rates sooner than later that could provide dollar weakness which should be supportive for crude prices the main driver for higher oil will remain on a pickup in global demand and that would likely stem from positive progress on all trade wars gold gold prices are poised for their best weekly performance in six months as trade wars have dealt a strong blow to global growth and further easing appears to be on the way from all the major central banks the yellow metal is poised for another major move higher if we see further dollar weakness fed cut rate bets have been on an upward trajectory and that could be confirmed if we see the strongest part of the us economy the labor market show signs of weakness content

motion of course it s absurd to track minute fluctuations at this point 2020 biden d 1 how biden s campaign confronted him on abortion for 2016 clinton campaign alumni this biden episode felt familiar clinton came out against the trans pacific partnership a trade deal she helped negotiate while serving as secretary of state a switch in positions as it happens that she made in part because of worries that biden was going to enter that year s primary and sap her union support hillary coming out against tpp after having championed it for years as a necessary counterbalance to china for years was a microcosm of our fatal flaws an aide who worked on the clinton campaign told me comparing the candidacies i actually think the perception of inauthenticity poses a similarly existential threat to biden albeit from the opposite direction for hillary it reinforced the most detrimental narratives about her whereas for biden it undermines his core appeal as the deeply principled straight talker the clinton aide added hillary and biden suffer from the same contradictory impulses you can give an impassioned defense of your record or you can convince people you ve legitimately evolved on an

ambitious plan on wednesday to revamp the u s voting system by cracking down on voter suppression and getting an additional 35 million people to the ballot box by the 2024 elections o rourke a former congressman from texas a state with tough voter id laws that critics say disproportionately affect the ability of minorities to vote said his proposal would also allow the registration of an additional 50 million u s voters no mention of cost but i assume it s trivial by the side of campaign spending but o rourke also wants term limits no avert we tried them in maine and all they do is ensure that the only legislature adjacent people with institutional memory are the lobbyists trump r 1 trump bets on more black support in 2020 he might need it trump managed 8 black support in 2016 and despite the gop s unpromising history his campaign manager thinks the president can more than quadruple that number next year trump managed 8 black support in 2016 and despite the gop s unpromising history his campaign manager thinks the president can more than quadruple that number next year at the end of the day democrats know this is the one voter base they cannot afford to have fractionalized told rcp we know they have to get a 93 7 split but a win for us a technical knockout for us would be something like 88 12 blackwell is a thoroughly bad man but he s right on this and

that while opinions of the president have been very consistent since 2016 obama trump voters have had a significant change in their view of president trump over the last two years in the 2016 voter survey more than 8 in 10 85 percent obama trump voters held a favorable view of the president 19 percentage points higher than in 2019 66 percent in other words while obama trump voters still overwhelmingly approve of the president that support is a lot softer than it was back in 2016 they did not find any significant movement among any other group of voters like those who supported romney in 2016 and trump in 2016 or those who voted romney 2012 and clinton in 2016 and while these obama trump voters remain supportive of the president even small movement among these voters who represented 5 percent of voters in 2016 writes the authors of the report may prove significant heading into the 2020 presidential election young voters have buttigieg and beto so why do they prefer old socialists older politicians have more opportunities to build track records and those might be more important to the young than to voters of other ideologies and age brackets why strong left leaning track records shared by sanders as well as gravel offer two major benefits first they bespeak a certain authenticity when sanders showed it was possible to rake in young votes with staunchly left policies plenty of center oriented democrats began to show interest in things such as medicare for all roast young lefties for naivete if you must but they seem to realize that a fight such as universal health care is going to require somebody truly invested in the idea who s willing to take enormous flak over it and suffer a few defeats without giving up in short endurance counts johnnies come lately inspire much less confidence on that front but aside from authentic commitment candidates with long track records suggest they have developed a personal politics with a deeper historical scope they don t think the problems in american life began when trump was elected nor do they believe that before that moment america was already great if your belief is that what s rotten in american politics stems from capitalism itself then those sudden explanations of what went wrong don t make sense the explanations that ring true go back decades impeachment democrats learned the wrong lesson from clinton s impeachment matthew dowd a senior strategist for bush s 2000 campaign told me that democrats today are learning the wrong lessons from clinton s impeachment by neglecting to consider how it shaped both election cycles especially the presidential race in january 2001 almost exactly two years after house republicans defied public opinion to impeach clinton the gop controlled the white house the house and initially the senate within months the republican jim jeffords of vermont would switch parties shifting control to the democrats having gone through all that dowd said i think the democrats are way too skittish on impeachment skittish is nice the political costs of not impeaching trump i don t know how else to say this getting impeached is bad it is not something you want to happen to you especially if you re president you do not want to go down as one of only four presidents in history to be impeached this is a bad thing only democrats bless our hearts could convince ourselves that it is good for a president to be impeached it is true that scandal is one of lichtman s keys it is also true that in 2018 and subsequently the democrat leadership bet the farm

has taken place in american political life the force driving this change is the digital era style of moral politics known as wokeness a phenomenon that has become pervasive in recent years and yet remains elusive as even experts struggle to give it a clear definition and accurately measure its impact over the past decade the baseline attitudes expressed by white liberals on racial and social justice questions have become radically more liberal in one especially telling example of the broader trend white liberals recently became the only demographic group in america to display a pro outgroup bias meaning that among all the different groups surveyed white liberals were the only one that expressed a preference for other racial and ethnic communities above their own as woke ideology has accelerated a growing faction of white liberals have pulled away from the average opinions held by the rest of the coalition of democratic voters including minority groups in the party and the woke elite act like white saviors who must lead the rest of the country including the racial minorities whose interests they claim to represent to a vision of justice the less enlightened groups would not choose for themselves consider for instance that black and asian democrats and liberals are significantly more supportive of restrictive immigration policies and less positive toward racial ethnic diversity than their white counterparts black and hispanic democrats and liberals are more sympathetic toward israel than the palestinians likely due in part to the fact that they tend to be more religious they are also more likely to part ways when it comes to contemporary social and gender identity issues including views of the metoo movement in all though they do converge on some issues the attitudes and policy preferences of the woke white left are unrepresentative of the marginalized communities with whom they are supposed to be allies and as woke liberals play a leading role in party politics the democrats who are increasingly defined by their embrace of diversity and progressive stances on issues of racial justice appear to do so at least partly at the direction of a small white elite whatever allies might mean identity politics groupings aren t sovereigns after all listening at the great awokening colleges and universities across the english speaking world are caught up in

influence washington heading into 2020 starting with plans to spend money to reelect lawmakers from either party who back its issues and are facing primary challenges some but definitely not all of the group s policy plans may intrigue democrats for instance one of the koch network s top priorities is extending protection to dreamers its stance on that issue has sometimes been met with pushback from its own donors i seem to recall a good deal of liberal democrat pearlclutching and yammering when sanders said open borders was a koch brothers proposal but he was right wasn t he the new deal

help their business but make no mistake the findings are profound as to how they inform the future of digital advertising they will also have a strong influence on the next steps in us privacy legislation put simply nearly all of the growth touted by the industry benefits intermediaries rather than the publishers who provide the news and entertainment and for the first time ever there is empirical research to dismiss long touted industry arguments that privacy rules will kill the golden goose that pays for free content put another way google is the largest buyer seller and transaction vehicle for digital ads that leverage personal data and google has by far the most personal data at this point it should hardly be a question whether this is a rigged market readers please note that

southern indiana and western kentucky it is social group signatures in hummingbird displays provide evidence of co occurrence of vocal and visual learning vocal learning in which animals modify their vocalizations based on social experience has evolved in several lineages of mammals and birds including humans despite much attention the question of how this key cognitive trait has evolved remains unanswered we tested for geographical variation consistent with learning of visual displays in long billed hermits phaethornis longirostris a lek mating hummingbird that like humans has both learned vocalizations and elaborate visual displays we found lek level signatures in both vocal parameters and visual display features including display element proportions sequence syntax and fine scale parameters of elements this variation was not associated with genetic differentiation between leks in the absence of genetic differences geographical variation in vocal signals at small scales is most parsimoniously attributed to learning suggesting a significant role of social learning in visual display ontogeny neat water human consumption of microplastics pdf evaluating approximately 15 of americans caloric intake we estimate that annual microplastics consumption ranges from 39000 to 52000 particles depending on age and sex these estimates increase to 74000 and 121000 when inhalation is

and corporations have so much money they literally don t know what to do with it and how we got here the fed s quantitative easing program pushed the cost of borrowing money to next to nothing for nearly a decade allowing companies to splurge on debt for mergers and acquisitions and to boost revenue at the same time globalization allowed them to reduce labor costs meaning that gains effectively were returned as profit and used by public companies to boost stock prices class of 2019 the members of the high school class of 2019 who enter the labor market right after graduating have better job prospects than young people who graduated from high school into the aftermath of the recession a result of the steady if slow progression of the economic recovery however compared with those who graduated into the strong 2000 labor market the class of 2019 still faces real economic challenges as demonstrated by elevated levels of underemployment as well as low wages and worsened wage gaps for black workers that s not a bug getting poorer while working harder the cliff effect because so many american jobs don t earn enough to pay for food housing and other basic needs many low wage workers rely on public benefits that are only available to people in need such as housing vouchers and medicaid to pay their bills earning a little more money may not automatically increase their standard of living if it boosts their income to the point where they lose access to some or all of those benefits that s because the value of those lost benefits may outweigh their income gains i have researched this dynamic which experts often call the cliff effect for years to learn why workers weren t succeeding at retaining their jobs following job training programs chief among the one step forward two steps back problems the cliff effect causes low paid workers can become reluctant to earn more money due to a fear that they will get worse off instead of better that s not a bug either complex

consumers cautious the economy has softened since the middle of last year as wary consumers spend less on discretionary items such as new cars clothing and footwear recreation and eating out sluggish wage growth and falling house prices have contributed to the consumer caution march quarter economic growth was a below par 0 4 per cent and annual growth slipped to 1 8 per cent the slowest yearly pace since 2009 official figures published this week showed while extreme headlines warning of a potential recession were reported by some media organisations it is not a scenario the central bank sees as likely unless a major economic shock hits such as a significant escalation of the us china trade and technology war even then a china downturn may not be negative for the australian economy in the short term if authorities in beijing stimulate and spur more demand for iron ore for construction advertisement lowe targets employment growth lowe who has a personal interest in talking up not down the economy said on tuesday night the rba rate cut was taken to support employment growth and to provide greater confidence that inflation will be consistent with the medium term target the australian economy is still expected to strengthen later this year supported by the low level of interest rates a pick up in growth in household disposable income ongoing investment in infrastructure and a brighter outlook for the resources sector lowe said i want to emphasise that the decision is not in response to a deterioration in our economic outlook since the previous update was published in early may some business leaders and former central bankers have questioned the effectiveness of cutting rates to ultra low levels the rba has acknowledged that reducing rates from already low levels has less of a positive impact on the real economy than rate cuts from higher levels advertisement yet the central bank still believes monetary policy is an important instrument in fostering a stronger economy currency complications lowe said this week a lower cash rate will put downward pressure on the australian dollar and put more cash in the hands of indebted consumers to spend a weaker currency will increase the cost of imported goods and boost demand for australian made goods helping lift inflation and domestic growth nevertheless growing market expectations that the us federal reserve could reverse course and cut interest rates in response to the us china trade war complicates this currency plan advertisement undoubtedly lowe has been a reluctant interest rate cutter yet the central bank believes that without some extra monetary stimulus unemployment would ultimately be higher and inflation lower that would be at odds with the rba s mandate to maintain price stability full employment and the economic prosperity and welfare of the australian people the rba is grappling with a new economic reality as inflation struggles to move up into the 2 3 per cent target band headline inflation is a weak 1 3 per cent and the bank s preferred measure of underlying inflation which excludes some volatile items is 1 6 per cent the rba has previously thought that 5 per cent unemployment would be enough to induce wage pressure as employers fight for scarce labour but the jobless rate has hovered around 5 per cent for almost a year and wage growth has only picked up modestly to 2 3 per cent advertisement the rba now thinks that full employment or the non accelerating inflation rate of unemployment is somewhere around 4 to 4 5 per cent this is partly based on the experience in economies such as the united states and united kingdom where the jobless rates have fallen below 4 per cent to stimulate better though not major wage growth hence the local labour market will need to tighten more to generate stronger wage growth and inflation ideally lowe would prefer not to be in this position of cutting rates to record low levels he co wrote a famous academic paper in 2002 that recognised the risks of loose monetary policy contributing to financial stability problems from asset price inflation arguably the rba overlooked this in cutting rates twice in 2016 when lowe was deputy to glenn stevens which helped fuel a surge in house prices in sydney and melbourne and increased the household debt to income ratio to 190 per cent advertisement but lowe thinks the latest monetary easing is unlikely to trigger a debt fuelled spike in house prices which have been falling lending practices have been tightened considerably and many lenders have become quite risk averse lowe said this week the demand for credit has also slowed due to the changed dynamics of the housing market and slower income growth so the risks on this front look to be less than they were previously lowe is also likely to keep pressuring the morrison government on infrastructure spending and reforms to tax innovation competition education and skills to boost productivity and lift economic growth his public remarks suggest he wants the government to go beyond its already planned 158 billion in income tax cuts and 100 billion of infrastructure spending over a decade the rba boss will get the chance to reinforce this message to treasurer josh frydenberg in japan this weekend at the group of 20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors
us stocks finished higher friday as optimism that the us and mexico can work out a deal before costly tariffs kick in next week helped power the market to its third straight gain a modest rally gained strength in the final hour of trading after bloomberg reported that the us was considering delaying a 5 per cent tariff on mexican goods that is set to go into effect on monday wall street moved higher on thursday credit ap the report came as the two countries held a second day of trade talks both sides claimed to be making progress but president donald trump insisted earlier in the day that a lot of progress had to be made before he would call off the tariffs investors have been anxious about escalating trade disputes between the us and key trading partners primarily china worries that the trade conflicts will drag on stifling economic growth and hurting corporate profits drove a monthlong sell off in may that derailed a market run that culminated with the benchmark s p 500 setting an all time high on april 30

by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s job growth slowed sharply in may and wages rose less than expected raising fears that a loss of momentum in economic activity could be spreading to the labor market which could put pressure on the federal reserve to cut interest rates this year the broad cool off in hiring reported by the labor department on friday was before a recent escalation in trade tensions between the united states and two of its major trading partners china and mexico analysts have warned the trade fights could undermine the economy which will celebrate 10 years of expansion next month the longest on record adding a sting to the closely watched employment report far fewer jobs were created in march and april than previously reported indicating that hiring had shifted into a lower gear the labor market thus far has been largely resilient to the trade war with china today s report makes a cut more likely and supports our view that the trade tensions will ultimately slow growth enough for the fed to respond in september and december with cuts said joseph song an economist at bank of america merrill lynch nyse in new york nonfarm payrolls increased by 75 000 jobs last month the government said it was the second time this year that job gains dropped below 100 000 economists polled by reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 185 000 jobs last month job growth in march and april was revised down by 75 000 president donald trump in early may slapped additional tariffs of up to 25 on 200 billion of chinese goods which prompted retaliation by beijing last week trump said he would impose a tariff on all goods from mexico to force authorities in that country to stop immigrants from central america from crossing the border into the united states talks to prevent the duties from kicking in at 5 on june 10 continue fed chairman jerome powell said on tuesday the u s central bank was closely monitoring the implications of the trade tensions on the economy and would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion trump who has routinely tweeted about the strong labor market made no comment about may s weak hiring but defended duties on chinese goods white house economic adviser kevin hassett told fox business network that bad weather in the midwest was to blame and described the meager job gains as a little bit of a blip down economists however said there was nothing to suggest the weather was the culprit the weakness in job growth was broadly experienced across industry groups and not obviously driven by distortions such as weather or strikes said michael feroli an economist at jpmorgan nyse in new york u s house of representative speaker nancy pelosi a democrat said the employment report was a disturbing sign that the administration s disastrous special interest agenda is hollowing out our economy following the report financial markets priced in a rate cut as early as july and two more later this year economists however believe the fed will probably wait for more signs of labor market weakness and clarity on the trade issues before easing monetary policy fed officials are due to meet on june 18 19 fed officials are likely to remain cautious at the june meeting and keep all their options open said michael hanson head of global macro strategy at td securities in new york the dollar fell to a 2 1 2 month low against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices rose stocks on wall street were trading higher worker shortages last month s slowdown in job gains however probably understates the labor market s health as layoffs remain low employment gains over the last three months have averaged 151 000 above the roughly 100 000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working age population in the four months since the first hiccup in hiring appeared in february however monthly payrolls gains have averaged just 127 000 the slowest pace over a comparable stretch in nearly seven years some of the weakness in hiring could be because of worker shortages especially in the construction transportation and manufacturing sectors but the worker shortage argument is somewhat undercut by moderate wage growth average hourly earnings grew just 3 1 year over year the slowest annual increase since september just three months earlier wages had been rising at their fastest rate in a decade but gains have moderated since the tepid employment report added to soft data on consumer spending business investment manufacturing and homes sales in suggesting the economy was losing momentum in the second

year low of 3 6 in may a broader measure of unemployment which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment dropped to 7 1 last month the lowest since december 2000 hiring slowed across all sectors in may with the share of industries showing job gains during the month the smallest since july 2016 manufacturing payrolls increased by 3 000 last month after gaining 5 000 positions in april the sector is struggling with an inventory overhang that has resulted in businesses placing fewer orders at

the company from the inside shareholder group the loan was made on terms favorable to the company with the consent of the senior lender marathon to whose debt facility the new loan is subordinated further such loans will be necessary during quarter 2 to accommodate ongoing cash flow needs given the later delivery dates for cmo batches on order from customers dr bell said in quarter 1 of 2019 we

margin as a percentage of revenue using a cost of goods sold product basis was 83 in 2019 compared to 86 in 2018 due to higher technology transfer revenues recorded in quarter 1 2018 selling and marketing expenses increased by 0 1 million or 6 to 1 4 million for the quarter compared to the same period in 2018 primarily from the increase in us production animal sales and marketing presence as we commence the establishment of new territories in this region regulatory and r d spending for the quarter was 0 4 million an increase of 0 2 million over the same period in 2018 primarily due to increased government regulatory fees year on year administration expenses increased 0 2 million to 1 5 million in 2019 compared to 1 3 million for the same period in 2018 due to slight timing differences in year on year administration expenses finance costs of 2 2 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 increased by 1 1 million over the same period in 2018 due to the difference in

economists have argued that the relative price of capital goods especially machinery and equipment is a key determinant of investment and growth restuccia and urrutia 2001 jones 1994 sarel 1995 lee 1995 delong and summers 1991 1993 the price of capital goods relative to consumption is much higher in poor countries and this was considered to be fundamental when explaining the lower investment rates living standards and growth in these economies there is less consensus what causes cross country heterogeneity in the relative price of capital goods some have argued that it reflects differences in countries productivity in the making of machinery and equipment or other tradable goods to exchange for them hsieh and klenow 2007 others link it to distortionary policy choices such as trade barriers in the capital goods sector eaton and kortum 2001 sposi 2015 research into cross country differences in relative capital goods prices has blossomed but those researchers have largely neglected the changes over time in these relative prices within countries in our recent research imf 2019 we have revisited the debate on what drives the relative price of investment and its macroeconomic implications using the dramatic changes in prices that have recently taken place across countries and sectors using sector level producer price data we were able to show that reductions in distortionary trade policies and improvements in productivity both contributed to the decline in the relative prices of capital goods analysis of country and sector level data shows that lower relative prices of capital goods have boosted real investment across countries as delong and summers 1991 among others have hypothesised rising trade tensions and sluggish productivity growth are likely to slow the decline in the relative price of investment goods which would hold back real investment growth we think that we should give renewed attention to this relatively unexplored channel through which the slowing pace of trade integration or its potential reversal can affect future economic prospects the stylised facts since 1990 the price of machinery and equipment relative to the price of consumption fell about 60 in advanced economies and about 40 in emerging market and developing economies figure 1 figure 1 dynamics of relative prices across types of capital goods and broad country groups percent change relative to 1990 sources penn world table 9 0 and imf staff calculations notes the figure shows the percentage change from the relative investment prices in 1990 the solid lines plot year fixed effects from a regression of low relative prices on year fixed effects and country fixed effects to control for entry and exit during the sample period and level differences in relative prices ae advanced economies emde emerging market and developing economies the fall in the relative price of computing equipment which has declined about 90 since 1990 based on klems data primarily from advanced countries is most striking overall these were dramatic declines especially when compared with the price of housing and commercial structures these mostly rose in price at the same rate as consumption or even faster in advanced economies other investment r d for example and transport equipment also declined in relative prices over time but this decrease was smaller figure 2 suggests that relative price decreases coincided with significant increases in the real investment rate in machinery and equipment over the last 50 years real investment in machinery and equipment has been steadily rising especially in emerging market and developing economies since 1990 real investment in machinery and equipment as a share of real gdp has risen from 3 to 6 contributing to much needed capital deepening in these economies figure 2 real investment rate and changes in the relative price of machinery and equipment sources penn world table 9 0 imf world economic outlook and iimf staff calculations notes the figure plots the real investment rate in machinery and equipment and changes in the price of machinery and equipment relative to the price of consumption changes in relative prices are relative to their levels in 1970 drivers of relative prices guided by previous research on the sources of differences in the relative price of capital goods across countries we asked whether large declines in relative prices are reflecting faster productivity growth in the capital goods producing sector or whether the removal of potential policy distortions such as reductions in trade costs drives relative prices disentangling the role of trade barriers is complicated by the fact that trade integration can affect prices through many channels lowering import tariffs may induce domestic producers to cut prices to match those offered by foreign competitors but trade liberalisation also has an indirect effect on prices through its effect on firm productivity e g pavcnik 2002 amiti and konings 2007 topalova and khandelwal 2011 bustos 2011 ahn et al 2019 to disentangle these effects we follow a three step approach 1 using sectoral producer price data across 40 advanced and emerging market economies and 33 sectors between 1995 and 2011 from the world input output database we estimate the elasticity of producer prices to changes in sectoral labour productivity and exposure to international trade we use import penetration the ratio of imports to domestic value added at the sectoral level instrumented with sectoral import tariffs to isolate changes in trade exposure triggered by policy choice 2 we estimate the elasticity of labour productivity at the sectoral level with respect to changes in policy induced import penetration 1 3 we use these estimated elasticities to decompose the overall decline in the relative prices of capital goods into change due to trade integration change due to the indirect effect of trade via productivity change due to improvements in relative productivity unrelated to trade and change due to all other factors the results figure 3 suggest that more than half of the decline in the relative prices of machinery and equipment between 2000 and 2011 can be traced to deepening trade integration both through its direct effect on producer prices and its effect via improvements in labour productivity figure 3 contributions to changes in relative producer prices of capital goods 2000 2011 source imf staff calculations notes the figure combines the estimated elasticities of producer prices to trade integration and relative labour productivity and changes in these factors for the capital goods sector between 2000 and 2011 to compute their contribution to the observed change in the producer price of capital goods relative to the price of consumption despite the effects of trade integration and technological progress on the decline in the relative investment prices across income groups figure 1 clearly shows that advanced economies experienced larger declines in the relative price of machinery and equipment than emerging market and developing economies therefore it may not be surprising that in the cross section of countries shown in figure 4 top panel low income countries continue to face higher relative prices of capital goods according to the latest available 2011 international comparison project data our analysis of the cross country determinants of relative capital goods prices suggests that both productivity differences in the tradable goods sectors and trade barriers play a role providing support to both sides of the debate interestingly policy induced trade costs seem to explain a larger fraction of the variation in relative capital goods prices across countries than natural trade barriers figure 4 bottom panel figure 4 relative price of machinery and equipment in the cross section of countries in 2011 sources international comparison program icp cepii geodist database feenstra and romalis 2014 fraser institute unctad world bank doing business indicators eora mrio database and imf staff calculations note the relative price of machinery and equipment is relative to the price of consumption policy related trade costs are freedom to trade tariffs on capital goods cost and time to import macroeconomic implications finally we seek to quantify how much of the increase in machinery and equipment investment over the past 30 years can be attributed to the decline in the relative prices of these goods we rely on both model based simulations and empirical evidence from country and sector level data we use the imf s global integrated monetary and fiscal model to isolate changes in relative prices of capital goods that are driven by two exogenous shocks a cut in tariffs on capital goods a shock to relative productivity of the capital goods producing sector we find that a 1 decline in the relative price of investment induced by either of these two shocks leads to approximately 0 8 increase in the ratio of the real investment rate to real gdp in the medium term our empirical estimates using country level and sectoral data concur with model simulations using a reduced form framework we relate real investment in machinery and equipment as a share of real output and the price of machinery and equipment relative to the price of consumption across 180 countries over 60 years from the penn world table 9 0 database our sectoral analysis which allows us to control for all time varying country factors that may have affected investment rates or prices relies on data from 15 broad sectors in 18 countries between 1971 and 2015 from the eu and world klems databases both country and sector level regressions indicate that a 1 decline in the relative prices of tradable capital goods is associated with an increase of between 0 2 and 0 5 in the real investment rate figure 5 top panel 2 these estimated elasticities suggest that the decline in the relative price of machinery has been at least as important as a broad set of macroeconomic policies in explaining the increase in real investment in machinery and transport equipment as a share of gdp over the past three decades figure 5 bottom panel figure 5 real investment rate in machinery and equipment source imf staff calculations note the bars depict the simulated estimated elasticity of the real investment to gdp to the price of capital goods relative to the price of consumption cross country sectoral regression includes country and

machinery and transport equipment investment to gdp ratios between 1990 94 to 2010 14 policies include real interest rates credit to gdp ratio capital account openness commodity terms of trade institutional quality infrastructure road quality these findings are a cause for concern with the slowdown in trade and sluggish productivity growth in recent years the decades long downward trend in relative prices of capital goods may be coming to an end preliminary evidence from advanced countries including the us byrne and pinto 2015 suggests that the decline in relative prices of capital goods has already slowed or stopped this could be ominous for future investment our goal is to bring attention to the relative price of capital goods as an important but overlooked driver of

march and april was not quite as robust as originally reported the stock markets are banking on the fed s ability to step in and save the day as it has for much of the last decade said cliff hodge director of investments for cornerstone wealth the next rate cut could come as early as july he said as the slide in bond yields signals that investors are preparing for slower economic growth while investors welcome the idea of a rate cut such a move would suggest that the central bank is worried about the economy which would not be good for the labor market said sameer samana senior global

washington june 6 xinhua the international monetary fund imf on thursday upgraded the u s economic growth forecast in 2019 to 2 6 percent while warning of further escalation in trade tensions and rising risks to its financial stability real gross domestic product gdp is expected to grow at an annual rate of 2 6 percent this year before moderating to 1 9 percent in 2020 the imf said in a concluding statement that describes the preliminary findings of its annual article iv consultation to review the u s economy the estimation however only considered the tariffs that have been put in place which means if the united states implements all proposed additional tariffs on its trading partners its gdp growth projection could be lowered earlier this week the world bank in its newly released semi annual global economic prospects report said the u s growth is forecast to ease to 2 5 percent this year and decelerate to 1 7 percent in 2020 despite a positive near term outlook for the u s economy the imf said a deepening of ongoing trade disputes or an abrupt reversal of the recent ebullient financial market conditions represent material risks to the u s economy with concomitant negative outward spillovers rising import tariffs and other steps taken by the trump administration are undermining the global trading system increasing restrictions on trade in goods and services and catalyzing a cycle of retaliatory trade responses the imf said tariff measures are likely to be ineffective at containing bilateral trade deficits and will be damaging to the u s and to global macroeconomic outturns it continued the proposed tariffs on all imported mexican goods in particular would have a negative economic effect on both countries and in sectors such as automobiles and agriculture the effects can be quite pronounced nigel chalk deputy director in the imf s western hemisphere department said at a press conference thursday citing the imf s estimate imf managing director christine lagarde said wednesday in a blog post that the existing tariffs that washington and beijing have imposed on each other s goods since 2018 combined with the envisaged tariffs of 25 percent on roughly 267 billion u s dollars in chinese products that the united states has threatened to levy would reduce global gdp by 0 5 percent in 2020 the trade tensions between the united states and its trading partners represent a threat to the global outlook and create important negative spillovers to other countries lagarde said at the press conference thursday it is especially important that the trade tensions between the united states and its trading partners including china and mexico are quickly resolved through a comprehensive agreement that results in a stronger and more integrated international trading system said the imf chief despite improvement of the financial market conditions in recent months lagarde said we are concerned that an abrupt reversal of financial market conditions could represent a material downside risk to the u s in particular a sudden tightening of financial conditions could interact adversely with the high levels of corporate and public debt and create a feedback loop that would also weigh on real activity and job creation she said this is something to watch out for the imf chief added that such a shift in financial conditions would also have negative outward spillovers for corporates sovereigns and financial institutions in other countries particularly those with significant leverage or rollover needs in u s dollars in the statement the imf also warned that the u s public debt is on an unsustainable path saying that policy adjustments are needed to lower the fiscal deficit and to put public debt on a gradual downward path over the medium term based on the budget proposal for fiscal year 2020 that president donald trump sent to congress in march the deficit is expected to reach about 1 trillion u s dollars for fiscal year 2020 the congressional budget office cbo estimated in may noting that federal debt held by the public would equal 87 percent of gdp in 2029 under the president s budget compared with 78 percent in 2019 any successful package will likely require steps to address the expected increases in entitlement spending on health and social security to raise indirect taxes and to institute a federal carbon tax lagarde said even though there are a lot of positives in the macroeconomic outcomes lagarde pointed out the imf s concern that the benefits from this decade long expansion have in general not been shared as widely as they could have been average life expectancy has trended downward in recent years income and wealth polarization have increased social mobility has steadily eroded education and health outcomes are suboptimal and while the poverty rate is falling it remains higher than in other advanced economies said the imf managing director we believe that more attention is warranted to promoting inclusive growth to social outcomes more into line with the good macroeconomic developments lagarde said highlighting policies such as instituting paid family leave expanding the earned income tax credit and helping working families with child and dependent care
coming up on the anniversary of the july 2018 trade truce between european commission president jean claude juncker and us president donald j trump little progress has been made in trade negotiations between the united states and the european union this article is the first in a series that will take stock of the opportunities in and challenges to the deepest trading relationship in the world and focuses on the current state of discussions the european union eu and the united states have over the decades built the world s most deeply integrated economic trade and investment relationship annually the united states exports around 575 billion in goods and services to the eu and imports approximately 684 billion services have become an increasingly important component of transatlantic trade flows making up an estimated bilateral trade of around 450 billion in which the united states runs a 60 billion trade surplus trade in goods still accounts for the bulk of the relationship however totaling more than 800 billion the eu runs a trade surplus in the bilateral goods trade of approximately 170 billion deep integration of trade and economies aside several longstanding economic dynamics affect the transatlantic relationship and hinder its expansion among these are the reality that trade is much more important to the european economy than to the us one the critical role of the us dollar as the most important global reserve currency and settlement currency for trade transactions and disagreements on aspects of non tariff barriers to trade and other policy areas that change through time but are always present including politically charged issues such as food standards and agricultural subsidies the current us eu trade dialogue stems from a joint statement by us president donald j trump and european commission president jean claude juncker in july 2018 in which they agreed among other things to work together toward zero tariffs zero non tariff barriers and zero subsidies on non auto industrial goods other aspects of the agreement included the eu stating its desire to purchase more liquified natural gas and soybeans from the united states notably the united states did not as part of that statement eliminate or reduce existing tariffs on aluminum and steel that it has levied on a large number of global trading partners including the eu since march 2018 in addition washington did not take off the table the prospect of new tariffs on european cars and auto parts in all its currently ongoing trade dialogues china north american free trade agreement etc and seemingly regardless of progress made the trump administration has reserved the right to unilaterally decide when key tariffs will be levied reduced or eliminated at its sole discretion and often without stating the conditions necessary to be achieved by the trading partner for an elimination or reduction the president s assessment of sufficient progress in the negotiations appears to be a key yardstick in such decisions discussions between us trade representative ustr robert lighthizer and eu trade commissioner cecilia malmström continue most recently in late may during the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd ministerial meetings but we are approaching the first anniversary of the trump juncker agreement without meaningful progress on the stated goals the ustr issued its negotiating objectives in january of this year and eu member states gave the green light to the european commission to start negotiating with the united states on industrial goods excluding agricultural products and on removing burdensome conformity assessment requirements where feasible removal of non tariff barriers the politically critical difference between the mandates is agriculture which the united states has decided to include in a change from the july 2018 agreement the absence of a complete agreement about the scope of the talks combined with the recent focus in europe on the eu parliamentary elections and upcoming change in the composition of the eu commission as well as the fact that washington is heavily engaged in other tense trade talks with china have resulted in a situation in which progress in the transatlantic trade dialogue has grounded to a near halt aside from the question of whether agriculture should be included in the talks another hindrance to progress has been the continued us threat of tariffs of up to 25 percent on european car and auto parts while trump recently postponed his decision on the tariffs with a new deadline of november 13 the reality is that the administration might levy them at any point between now and then if politically expedient or if it is unhappy with the pace of the dialogue malmström has stated repeatedly that car tariffs would bring any existing dialogue to an end in addition on the us side several simultaneous trade dialogues are taking attention away from negotiations with the eu namely tensions with china and the reignited dispute with mexico which has put into question the progress made to date on a revised nafta agreement given the apparent lower priority of making progress in the dialogue with the eu it is no surprise malmström concluded after the may meeting in paris that the united states does not appear to be ready to start on the tariff negotiations bart oosterveld is director of the atlantic council s global business and economics program and c boyden gray fellow on global finance and growth related experts bart oosterveld image us

reports from toronto and vancouver real estate boards suggest that the national housing market will likely continue to firm in may after a strong print in april job growth continued at a decent clip in may with economy adding 28k jobs u s tariff threats muddy the economic waters trade tensions continued to dominate economic headlines this week with the u s mexico quarrel taking center stage mexico sent a senior delegation to d c to try to address president trump s concerns regarding illegal migration and to defuse the impending tariff threat while some progress has been made as at the time of writing it is unclear if a deal can be reached by monday s deadline with mexico busy at the negotiation table president trump tilted the conversation back to china by reaffirming the threat to raise tariffs on another 300 billion of chinese goods china s commerce ministry struck a defiant tone in response suggesting that china would fight till the end if need be beyond the colorful language there were signs that the conflict is spreading beyond goods trade with china cautioning its citizens about the dangers of travelling or studying in the united states the uncertainty generated by these events has kept the fed on high alert among several fed speeches this week fed chair powell noted that the fed was monitoring trade developments closely and was ready to act as appropriate to sustain the expansion chair powell s emphasis on the fed s flexibility appeared to soothe equity markets which rebounded to a three week high financial conditions factor heavily in fomc decisions but economic data is the primary determinant on that front data this week reinforced the view that while growth has slowed there are no impending signs of calamity trade tensions are weighing on the manufacturing sector but the much larger services non manufacturing side of the economy is holding up as highlighted by the divergent performance of the ism indices through may chart 1 that said the most awaited report of the week the jobs report was a bit of a downer with payrolls rising by only 75k in may over 100k short of market consensus this came alongside downward revisions of 75k to the previous two months looking through the recent volatility the hiring trend has slowed but remains decent averaging 151k in the last three months chart 2 this is broadly in line with our expectations in addition most other aspects of the may report were encouraging the unemployment rate held steady at 3 6 and wage growth while slowing a touch held above 3 y y with the broad economic backdrop still decent trade and global growth remain the ultimate wildcard mexico is the second biggest source of goods entering the u s after china as such the impending 5 tariff will be problematic particularly for products that cross the border multiple times i e auto parts prospects for an increase in the tariff rate to 25 are more daunting with supply chain disruptions reduced market access and the hit to confidence all more acute a simultaneous escalation in tensions with mexico and china would accentuate these risks further in the event that tensions escalate in this fashion the fed will have little choice but to act canada data reaffirms bank of canada s steady approach global equity markets were on a better footing this week investors spirits were lifted by a more dovish stance of some central banks which fueled hopes of a rate cut amid escalating trade tensions and growing downside risks to global growth the s p tsx composite followed it its global peers ending the week higher after falling precipitously last week oil prices wti edged slightly lower this week while canadian dollar has strengthened this week s economic data also looked reassuring providing further credence to ours and the bank of canada view that after two quarters of tepid growth the canadian economy is emerging from the soft patch international trade showed improvement building on a healthy momentum in march

with sales and prices rising in may in vancouver sales also posted a double digit increase on the month that being said despite the sizeable gain vancouver s housing market will not be off to the races any time soon as the overall demand remains very subdued relative to history hindered by lingering affordability challenges and several rounds of provincial regulations on top of stricter federal mortgage rules and past rate hikes capping this week s encouraging data were today s employment numbers following a blockbuster print in april job creation continued at a decent clip in may with economy adding 28k jobs however the fly in the ointment was that all of the gains and then some were in self employment while both private and public sectors shed jobs that being said some

view after two quarters of sub 0 5 prints we expect real gdp growth will average closer to 2 over the rest of the year while the outlook is laden with significant risks the bank of canada believes that the degree of accommodation remains appropriate thus even as the market expectations intensify for the u s federal reserve to cut policy rate this year with similar if less intense moves seen

the us china trade war the uncertainty over brexit the slowing chinese economy these are just a few major risks to the global economy the economist intelligence unit says in its 2019 global risks report that the growing geopolitical uncertainty is a source of significant risk here we take a look at the top 10 biggest global economic risks in 2019 as per the economist intelligence unit eiu ranked the biggest global economic risks the rise of populist leaders in major countries around the world could hurt the global economy their protectionist and nationalist policies could lead to increased international tensions such policies could trigger trade wars and destabilize financial markets the eiu warned that if the trend towards populism continues tensions around the world will continue to increase these are the top 10 biggest global economic risks 10 political and financial instability lead to an italian banking crisis this is a low risk low impact scenario the italian economy has been struggling for years its economy shrank in the third and fourth quarters of 2018 because of the tightening liquidity conditions and the domestic political and economic uncertainty the country s government debt stands at around 130 of its gdp 9 a disorderly no deal brexit the complicated and lengthy negotiations between the uk and the european union have led to uncertainty and tension if the political gridlock in the uk leads to a disorderly no deal brexit the eiu estimates that it could negatively affect britain s gdp by 7 7 to 9 3 over the next 15 years 8 a potential military confrontation on the korean peninsula it s a very low risk scenario with a very high impact a major armed conflict between north korea and south korea could have catastrophic consequences not only for the two countries involved but for the entire region and beyond however recent interactions between the us and north korean leaders have brought a glimmer of hope 7 cyber attacks and data integrity concerns in the last few years we have seen massive data breaches at facebook google and dozens of other companies that exposed data of hundreds of millions of people worldwide all that data could be used for propaganda the eiu believes that social media companies would face tougher regulations in the coming years meanwhile the incidents of cyber attacks for espionage data theft and money theft continue to rise last year the us germany and many other countries saw large scale cyber attacks on their government networks 6 territorial disputes in the south or east china sea the rising political economic and military might of china has led to increased tensions between china and its neighbors there are dozens of disputed islands and reefs in the south china sea and the east china sea tensions between beijing and the united states have also become a cause of worry as china tries to assert its dominance 5 a sudden surge in oil prices due to supply shortages this is a high impact global economic risk according to the eiu the increased oil output from russia and saudi arabia has eased concerns of an unexpected surge in oil prices but the risk remains as the us is convincing major importers to stop importing oil from iran 4 a disorderly and prolonged economic downturn in china should china suffer a prolonged economic downturn the entire world would feel the impact due to global connectedness the trade tensions between the us and china are already affecting chinese exports beijing is currently shifting its economy from export driven to the one driven by domestic consumption but the domestic debt remains at 230 of gdp which gives china little room to drive growth the government could end up making a few policy missteps in its efforts to boost growth 3 contagion spreads to create a broad based emerging markets crisis the us monetary tightening and the strengthening us dollar led to currency volatility in many emerging markets last year countries such as turkey and argentina that were also suffering from political instability saw a full blown currency crisis if a few emerging countries fall into crisis due to the us china trade war or domestic factors investors would flee emerging markets 2 the us corporate debt burden turns downturn into a recession the american economy s fundamentals remain fairly robust the eiu believes that the us will avoid a damaging recession in 2019 20 but the slowing growth in europe the us china trade war domestic financial sector vulnerabilities and other factors could turn the downturn into a full blown recession 1 the us china trade war turns into a global trade war the us has slapped additional tariffs on 250 billion worth of chinese goods and is considering hiking tariffs on the remaining 325 billion worth of chinese imports beijing has retaliated by increasing tariffs on more than 110 billion of american goods there is a risk that the us china trade tensions could escalate on additional fronts in the coming years triggering a full blown global trade war

would have moved out of miami by now if not for my husband s additional income beginner teachers have an even tougher time affording miami skyrocketing housing prices combined with relatively low educator salaries have made the area one of the nation s priciest cities for starting teachers in the first analysis of its kind usa today examined salaries and housing costs for teachers all over the country new teachers can t afford the median rent almost anywhere in the u s the analysis shows a point often made during recent teacher strikes across the country but that s not the full story it s not just pay no matter where they work or what they earn teachers feel disrespect despite widespread demand for higher salaries teachers in some regions are actually making ends meet especially as they approach the middle of their careers in other areas mid career teachers are right to say they can t afford to live on their salaries without picking up side hustles or commuting long distances some of those places are only affordable for the very highest paid teachers and then there are places that no teacher can afford no matter how much they earn like miami loading a lot of people who have a passion for education cannot make it as a career said karla hernandez mats president of the union for teachers in miami dade county public schools we have teachers as uber drivers lyft drivers they certainly love teaching but they can t pay their bills with love what does affordable mean to gauge teachers standard of living usa today looked at salaries in the lowest middle and highest pay brackets in almost all the nation s metropolitan areas cities and their surrounding counties the data reflect the earnings of teachers in public and private schools collected as part of a bureau of labor statistics survey released in may 2017 areas were deemed affordable if teachers would have to spend no more than 30 of their salaries after accounting for federal taxes to afford the local median rent or mortgage that s in line with experts recommendations for budgeting in today s era of teacher strikes and walkouts the analysis answers a key question can educators in this area afford to live on their take home pay often that answer was no because housing costs exceeded 30 of teachers salaries after taxes the reasons why varied depending on the community starting teacher salaries were low or teachers pay didn t increase much over time or housing was comparably expensive compounding teachers financial troubles are other costs the analysis could not include like student debt health insurance contributions and child care costs starting out teachers can afford few cities beginning teachers or those in the bottom 10 of the pay scale can afford to rent a median priced unit in

base around 3 000 students attend schools in the local district 83 of them are poor a starting johnstown teacher with a bachelor s degree earns 49 995 nearby homes are relatively cheap in part because the city has a number of blighted properties and public housing complexes as a result said nancy behe president of the johnstown teachers union many teachers own their homes instead of renting teacher pay varies in the smaller districts nearby but in one the starting salary is just 18 500 behe said which pulls down pay for the johnstown metro area in the usa today analysis loading new teachers can

000 said kathryn richison a longtime springfield teacher houses in springfield are affordable she said that s largely because people aren t clamoring to buy or rent them many choose to live instead in nearby dayton or columbus for the big city amenities richison said loading how much should teachers be paid the average salary of a u s teacher was 58 950 in 2016 17 when adjusted for inflation that s slightly less than what the average teacher earned almost two decades ago even when benefits are thrown in america s teachers earned 13 less in 2018 than private sector workers with similar levels of

than i do she said education coverage at usa today is made possible in part by a grant from the bill melinda gates foundation the gates foundation does not provide editorial input how we did it this story caps a school year focus on the pressures facing american teachers to perform the analysis usa today relied on data from two sources salary figures came from employers who reported to the bureau of labor statistics occupational employment statistics program as released in may 2017 because elementary teachers are the most prevalent the analysis focused on elementary pay in the 10th median and 90th percentile in each metro the survey includes public and private schools other analyses of teacher salaries tend to use a single measure of pay usually starting teacher salaries or median pay both of which oversimplify the issue usa today s spectrum of pay approach based on percentiles was designed to account for the fact that most teachers make more money as they gain years of experience similarly examining pay in metro areas instead of states allowed reporters to differentiate between high and low cost areas even within the same state to further account for real life factors usa today applied the federal tax rate for single filers to each salary figure to estimate elementary teachers take home pay in each metro next the analysis aimed to show whether teachers could afford to live on their take home pay their pay was compared with the proprietary zillow rental index from the real estate website that measure starts with median rents in each metro and applies a three month moving average while accounting for outlier figures the analysis focused on rent prices because mortgage payments can vary dramatically based on local taxes interest rates and insurance rates rental prices were most inclusive of the additional costs that factor into housing the 291 metros analyzed were those for which data existed in both the federal salary and zillow data sets
source xinhua 2019 06 07 07 11 47 editor liu video player close washington june 6 xinhua the international monetary fund imf on thursday upgraded the u s economic growth forecast in 2019 to 2 6 percent while warning of further escalation in trade tensions and rising risks to its financial stability real gross domestic product gdp is expected to grow at an annual rate of 2 6 percent this year before moderating to 1 9 percent in 2020 the imf said in a concluding statement that describes the preliminary findings of its annual article iv consultation to review the u s economy the estimation however only considered the tariffs that have been put in place which means if the united states implements all proposed additional tariffs on its trading partners its gdp growth projection could be lowered earlier this week the world bank in its newly released semi annual global economic prospects report said the u s growth is forecast to ease to 2 5 percent this year and decelerate to 1 7 percent in 2020 despite a positive near term outlook for the u s economy the imf said a deepening of ongoing trade disputes or an abrupt reversal of the recent ebullient financial market conditions represent material risks to the u s economy with concomitant negative outward spillovers rising import tariffs and other steps taken by the trump administration are undermining the global trading system increasing restrictions on trade in goods and services and catalyzing a cycle of retaliatory trade responses the imf said tariff measures are likely to be ineffective at containing bilateral trade deficits and will be damaging to the u s and to global macroeconomic outturns it continued the proposed tariffs on all imported mexican goods in particular would have a negative economic effect on both countries and in sectors such as automobiles and agriculture the effects can be quite pronounced nigel chalk deputy director in the imf s western hemisphere department said at a press conference thursday citing the imf s estimate imf managing director christine lagarde said wednesday in a blog post that the existing tariffs that washington and beijing have imposed on each other s goods since 2018 combined with the envisaged tariffs of 25 percent on roughly 267 billion u s dollars in chinese products that the united states has threatened to levy would reduce global gdp by 0 5 percent in 2020 the trade tensions between the united states and its trading partners represent a threat to the global outlook and create important negative spillovers to other countries lagarde said at the press conference thursday it is especially important that the trade tensions between the united states and its trading partners including china and mexico are quickly resolved through a comprehensive agreement that results in a stronger and more integrated international trading system said the imf chief despite improvement of the financial market conditions in recent months lagarde said we are concerned that an abrupt reversal of financial market conditions could represent a material downside risk to the u s in particular a sudden tightening of financial conditions could interact adversely with the high levels of corporate and public debt and create a feedback loop that would also weigh on real activity and job creation she said this is something to watch out for the imf chief added that such a shift in financial conditions would also have negative outward spillovers for corporates sovereigns and financial institutions in other countries particularly those with significant leverage or rollover needs in u s dollars in the statement the imf also warned that the u s public debt is on an unsustainable path saying that policy adjustments are needed to lower the fiscal deficit and to put public debt on a gradual downward path over the medium term based on the budget proposal for fiscal year 2020 that president donald trump sent to congress in march the deficit is expected to reach about 1 trillion u s dollars for fiscal year 2020 the congressional budget office cbo estimated in may noting that federal debt held by the public would equal 87 percent of gdp in 2029 under the president s budget compared with 78 percent in 2019 any successful package will likely require steps to address the expected increases in entitlement spending on health and social security to raise indirect taxes and to institute a federal carbon tax lagarde said even though there are a lot of positives in the macroeconomic outcomes lagarde pointed out the imf s concern that the benefits from this decade long expansion have in general not been shared as widely as they could have been average life expectancy has trended downward in recent years income and wealth polarization have increased social mobility has steadily eroded education and health outcomes are suboptimal and while the poverty rate is falling it remains higher than in other advanced economies said the imf managing director we believe that more attention is warranted to promoting inclusive growth to social outcomes more into line with the good macroeconomic developments lagarde said highlighting policies such as instituting paid family leave expanding the earned income tax credit and helping working families with child and dependent care

security forces to stem the flow of illegal central american migrants u s president donald trump had threatened to impose 5 import tariffs on all mexican goods starting on monday if mexico did not commit to do more to tighten its borders in a joint declaration after three days of talks in washington both countries said mexico agreed to immediately expand along the entire border a program that sends migrants seeking asylum in the united states to mexico while they await adjudication of their cases trump said mexico had agreed to take strong measures to reduce or eliminate illegal

asylum seekers advertisement advertisement the tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the u s on monday against mexico are hereby indefinitely suspended trump said in a tweet on friday evening frustrated by a recent surge of migrants that has overwhelmed u s resources on its southern border trump had used the threat of tariffs to pressure mexico into making concessions he has made hard line efforts to reduce illegal immigration a cornerstone of his presidency and it is certain to be a key issue in his re election bid next year but business groups and even some close republican allies were unhappy with the prospect of tariffs on the top u s trade partner saying they would damage the economy advertisement advertisement duties on mexico would also have left the united states fighting trade wars with two of its three largest trading partners and would further unnerve financial markets already on edge about a global economic slowdown mexican foreign minister marcelo ebrard said in washington his team had also resisted u s requests to send deported guatemalans to mexico he said he was satisfied with the deal i think it s a fair balance because they had more drastic measures and proposals at the start and we reached some middle point he said emphasizing the importance to mexico of having kept safe third country out of the deal he also highlighted u s support in the agreement for a mexican proposal to jointly address underlying causes of migration from central america advertisement advertisement the asylum program to be expanded is commonly known as remain in mexico and currently operates in the border cities of tijuana mexicali and ciudad juarez under the new deal returned asylum seekers will spend long periods in mexican cities such as reynosa on the texas border where drug cartels frequently kidnap migrants the program was challenged in court earlier this year by the american civil liberties union aclu and other rights groups which say it puts asylum seekers in danger and violates u s and international law while a federal judge ruled to halt the policy a u s appeals court overturned the decision allowing the policy to continue as the legal challenge is ongoing through june 5 10 393 mostly central americans have been sent back to mexico since the program started in january advertisement advertisement omar jadwat director of the aclu s immigrants rights project said the group would continue to press its legal challenge to the policy under the deal mexico will also increase its efforts to stop illegal migrants from central america traveling through mexico to the united states those measures will include deploying the militarized national guard security force to its southern border ebrard said the national guard deployment would start on monday the two countries will continue discussions to be completed in 90 days on further steps according to the declaration u s border officers apprehended more than 132 000 people crossing from mexico in may the highest monthly level since 2006 trump who has called the surge in migrants an invasion had threatened to keep raising duties up to 25 unless mexico addressed the problem advertisement advertisement mexico had prepared a list of possible retaliatory tariffs targeting products from agricultural and industrial states regarded as trump s electoral base a tactic china has also used with an eye toward the republican president s 2020 re election bid the united states slapped tariffs of up to 25 on 200 billion in chinese imports last month prompting beijing to levy its own tariffs on 60 billion in american goods trump said on thursday he would decide later this month whether to hit beijing with tariffs on an additional list of 300 billion in chinese goods economists

american consumers would pay a hefty price if president donald trump carries out his latest tariff threat against mexico but that s just one of many issues created by the president s pledge to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on one of the country s largest trading partners trump said via tweet on thursday he would impose tariffs of 5 percent on all mexican imports beginning june 10 in response to the flow of migrants over the southern u s border a subsequent white house statement said the tariffs would rise incrementally up to 25 percent by oct 1 unless mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory the uncertainty caused financial markets to plummet and threatened to send stocks lower for the sixth week in a row this is just the latest worry to put on the fire for investors said ryan detrick senior market strategist for lpl financial can we really fight two trade wars at the same time the prospect of fighting trade wars on multiple fronts spooks investors and executives alike as we are all fighting to develop plans to exit or to reduce our exposure to china one of our options mexico is now equally in jeopardy said rick helfenbein president and ceo of the american apparel footwear association this could roil u s and global financial markets which could see this as a signal that trump is leading us in the direction of a global trade war if that were to happen the u s economy could get hit hard said desmond lachman resident fellow at the american enterprise institute a right leaning think tank from a consumer perspective everything from cars to vegetables would get more expensive the u s imports 53 billion worth of autos from mexico and the country also is a major supplier of produce electronics and apparel including more than one third of men s and boy s jeans according to helfenbein prices will go up sales will go down jobs will be lost he said this has a devastating effect on our industry a lot of companies in the u s not just retailers treat north america as a unified market said david french senior vice president of government relations at the national retail federation it opens a new front in uncertainty for retailers but really for the u s economy president trump s attempt to bully mexico has horrified u s businesses as well as mexican political leaders said ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics we expect the market to keep falling until the president blinks lachlan estimated that a 25 percent tariff on all mexican imports could add 0 4 percent to inflation but even more than just the health of the economy is at stake it borders more on the crazy bill daley former u s secretary of commerce under president bill clinton said on cnbc s squawk box on friday characterizing trump s mexico tariff threat as throwing gas on a fire the really shocking thing about this from a political standpoint is this is an abrupt reversal of everything the administration has been signaling about its top legislative priority said phil levy senior fellow on the global economy at the chicago council on global affairs levy pointed out that on thursday u s trade representative robert lighthizer asked congress to begin the ratification process for the united states mexico canada agreement usmca trump s replacement to the north american free trade agreement the office of the u s trade representative has called the trade pact a mutually beneficial win for north american workers farmers ranchers and businesses that would create a more level playing field for american exports now its passage is in jeopardy although acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney told reporters on thursday the two are absolutely not linked and said these are not tariffs as part of a trade dispute experts disagree saying trump absolutely risks derailing the pact slapping tariffs on mexico would almost certainly be deemed illegal under world trade organization rules trade experts on both the right and the left say this is alarming because it sends a message to all u s trading partners that the president has no compunctions about breaking treaties even ones he orchestrated it s a clear signal the president does not feel bound by trade agreements levy said as the threat of a full on trade war with china grows beijing is more likely to dig in if its trade negotiators believe trump would extract concessions in order to make a deal only to turn around and break his word in the eyes of the outside world this means that the u s is now the world s biggest rogue trader shepherdson said this has far reaching implications that could leave the u s with a tarnished reputation on the global stage well after trump s presidency is over a legacy that could take a long time to overcome this action would further undermine the rule based international trade system that the u s so painfully put together in the post war period lachman said does this seem like the

imf chief christine lagarde on wednesday urged the countries to make resolving the trade conflict a priority the us economy is expanding faster than any other advanced nation and in weeks will hit a historic milestone but the international monetary fund and many economists are warning of building signs of trouble president donald trump s multi front trade wars especially with economic power china and the coming conflict with mexico threaten to stifle growth in those countries and have dire consequences for the global economy for now us data is showing little impact on the overall economy but global financial markets have been shaken by the trade conflict and the us federal reserve this week opened the door to cutting interest rates to salvage growth the imf upgraded its forecast for us growth this year to 2 6 percent three tenths higher than it predicted in april while growth in 2020 is seen slowing to just under two percent the us commerce department reported thursday that the trade deficit fell in april good news for trump who has made that a key focus of his administration however the deficit in goods trade with china expanded undercutting the goal of his aggressive tariff strategy and economists note that falling imports and exports are a sign us economic momentum is weakening it s nice that the trade deficit narrowed but it did so for all the wrong reasons economist joel naroff wrote in a note to clients material risks in its annual review of the us economy the imf warned that material risks overshadow the outlook including trade uncertainty rising debt levels and growing inequality it is especially important that the trade tensions between the us and china which represent a threat to the global outlook and create important negative spillovers to other countries are quickly resolved the report said in contrast to the upgrade for the united states the imf this week trimmed the outlook for china to 6 2 percent this year a tenth lower than in april imf chief christine lagarde on wednesday urged the countries to make resolving the trade conflict a priority since it threatens the global economy which has already begun slowing and the us is not safe even from its perch of atop the economic hierarchy lagarde told reporters thursday there is lot for americans to be proud of in a matter of weeks the us economy will be in the longest expansion in recorded history however she flagged the concerns raised in the imf report warning that public debt is on an unsustainable upward path and corporate debt is rising leaving the economy vulnerable should interest rates rise and more action is needed to address inequality and help those hurt by the move to globalization and the increased use of technology the report said lagarde said the benefits from this decade long expansion have in general not been shared as widely as they could have been and noted the united states has the highest poverty rate of any advanced economy and that life expectancy is falling the median household income has risen only 2 2 percent from the end of the last century even though the economy has expanded 23 percent per capita the wealth and income distribution are increasingly polarized the report said the poorest 40 percent of households have a level of net wealth that is lower today than it was in 1983 the fund called on washington to raise revenues from measures like a carbon or gas taxes to pay for improvements in education and infrastructure that could boost productivity and economic growth likewise a reform of immigration policies towards high skilled workers could increase productivity as well as lessen the pressures from aging in the us population the report said

ten billion here ten billion there president donald trump s escalating tariffs on imports to the united states have begun to amount to serious money and potentially to imperil one of the most resilient economies in american history until now the economy has largely shrugged off damage from trump s trade wars even as the self proclaimed tariff man piled import taxes on everything from turkish steel to canadian aluminium to chinese burglar alarms the job market has remained sturdy at 3 6 per cent the unemployment rate is at its lowest point in a half century in july the expansion that followed the great recession will become the longest on records dating to 1854 but over the past month trump has made a higher stakes gamble on the economy s durability he s more than doubled tariffs on usd200 billion in chinese imports he s preparing to tax an additional usd300 billion in goods from china extending his import taxes to everything beijing sells to the united states and in a move that alarmed some of his own advisers and caught investors by surprise trump said he would impose a 5 per cent tax on mexican imports starting monday a tax that would reach 25 per cent by oct 1 if the mexican government fails to stop a flow of central american migrants into the united states combined the actions mark a broad escalation of trump s trade wars the new tariffs on chinese and mexican imports amount to potentially usd 190 billion a year in new taxes paid by us importers and typically passed on to consumers higher prices for american households for american households this means higher prices on fruits and vegetables autos electronic components and other necessities what s more exporters especially farmers can expect to suffer retaliation when china and mexico hit back with tariffs or other sanctions on exports from the us the tariffs inflict other damage that is harder to measure they generate uncertainty for american businesses over where to buy supplies sell goods or situate factories and offices and they rattle investors and undercut consumer and business confidence researchers at ubs calculate that a 25 per cent tariff on all chinese imports would shave a full percentage point from u s growth over the next year the economy grew 2 9 per cent in 2018 and will likely be weaker for 2019 add a 25 per cent tax on mexican goods they say and the united states could tumble into recession for the first time since 2009 fed s support the federal reserve has taken notice chairman jerome powell made clear this week that the fed is prepared intervene likely by lowering interest rates if the trade wars were deemed to threaten the expansion still it s far from sure that trump s trade conflicts even if they escalate will imperil the economy economic impact pinelopi goldberg chief economist of the world bank and economists pablo fajgelbaum of ucla patrick kennedy of the university of california berkeley and amit khandelwal of columbia university calculated that the economic loss from the trade wars last year amounted a minuscule 0 04 per cent of gross domestic product the broadest gauge of economic output their figure doesn t include the latest tariff threats one reason is that trade accounts for a surprisingly small portion of the economy exports and imports combined equal just 27 per cent of u s gdp the world bank calculates the share is lower in only seven other countries none of them an industrial power like the us yet despite its modest economic role trade punches above its weight in american political discourse consider the revamped version of the politically contentious north american free trade agreement that the us negotiated last year with canada and mexico one of trump s policy achievements trump said the new pact the us mexico canada agreement would create jobs and restore america s status as a manufacturing powerhouse by drawing factories back to the us from low wage mexico but the independent us international trade commission analysed the new agreement and concluded that it would boost the economy by just usd68 billion and add 176 000 jobs over six years negligible gains in a usd21 trillion economy and a job market exceeding 150 million people likewise said jason furman who served as chairman of president barack obama s council of economic advisers to date most of trump s trade war has been too small to have a large aggregate economic impact that said furman warned that if the china tariffs were extended to all products and if tariffs were also imposed on mexico we could start to actually see the trade war in jobs gdp and other aspects of the economy furman who is now at the harvard kennedy school said he doubts the new tariffs would tip the united states economy into recession but they would certainly help push it in that direction for months businesses and investors have largely convinced themselves that trump would deploy his tariffs only temporarily as leverage to pry concessions from china mexico and others and just over a month ago it looked as if the us and china were nearing a resolution in their conflict over beijing s aggressive push to overtake american technological dominance but negotiations collapsed and trump ramped up tariffs after the us side accused beijing of reneging on commitments made earlier in the negotiations

job applicants line up during a recruitment fair in new york on friday associated press us job growth slowed sharply in may and wages rose less than expected raising fears that a loss of momentum in economic activity could be spreading to the labour market which could put pressure on the federal reserve to cut interest rates this year the broad cool off in hiring reported by the labour department on friday was even before a recent escalation in trade tensions between the united states and two of its major trading partners china and mexico analysts have warned the trade fights could undermine the economy which will celebrate 10 years of expansion next month the longest on record adding a sting to the closely watched employment report the economy created far fewer jobs in march and april than previously reported the economy thus far has been largely resilient to the trade war with china president donald trump in early may slapped additional tariffs of up to 25 on 200 billion of chinese goods which prompted retaliation by beijing last week trump said he would impose a tariff on all goods from mexico in a bid to force authorities in that country to stop immigrants from central america from crossing the border into the united states talks are ongoing to prevent the duties from kicking in at 5 on june 10 fed chairman jerome powell said on tuesday the central bank was closely monitoring the implications of the trade tensions on the economy and would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion today s report makes a cut more likely and supports our view that the trade tensions will ultimately slow growth enough for the fed to respond in september and december with cuts said joseph song an economist at bank of america merrill lynch in new york nonfarm payrolls increased by 75 000 jobs last month the government said in its closely watched employment report falling below the roughly 100 000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working age population economists polled by reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 185 000 jobs last month job growth in march and april was revised down by 75 000 in the wake of the weak report financial markets priced in a rate cut as early as july and two more later this year us treasury prices rallied while the dollar dropped against a basket of currencies stocks on wall street were trading higher may s disappointing job growth was flagged by a report on wednesday from payrolls processing firm adp showing the smallest gain in private payrolls in nine years last month another report this week showed a drop in online ads by businesses looking for help last month s slowdown in job gains however probably understates the health of the labour market as measures such as weekly applications for unemployment benefits and the institute for supply management s services employment gauge have suggested underlying strength some of the weakness in hiring last month could be the result of worker shortages especially in the construction transportation and manufacturing sectors monthly wage growth remained moderate in may with average hourly earnings increasing six cents or 0 2 following a similar gain in april that lowered the annual increase in wages to 3 1 from 3 2 in april the average workweek was unchanged at 34 4 hours last month the moderation in wage gains if sustained could

how trump tariffs on china and mexico could hurt us economy washington ap ten billion here ten billion there president donald trump s escalating tariffs on imports to the united states have begun to amount to serious money and potentially to imperil one of the most resilient economies in american history until now the economy has largely shrugged off damage from trump s trade wars even as the self proclaimed tariff man piled import taxes on everything from turkish steel to canadian aluminum to chinese burglar alarms the job market has remained sturdy at 3 6 the unemployment rate is at its lowest point in a half century in july the expansion that followed the great recession will become the longest on records dating to 1854 but over the past month trump has made a higher stakes gamble on the economy s durability he s more than doubled tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports he s preparing to tax an additional 300 billion in goods from china extending his import taxes to everything beijing sells to the united states and in a move that alarmed some of his own advisers and caught investors by surprise trump said he would impose a 5 tax on mexican imports starting monday a tax that would reach 25 by oct 1 if the mexican government fails to stop a flow of central american migrants into the united states combined the actions mark a broad escalation of trump s trade wars the new tariffs on chinese and mexican imports amount to potentially 190 billion a year in new taxes paid by u s importers and typically passed on to consumers for american households this means higher prices on fruits and vegetables autos electronic components and other necessities what s more exporters especially farmers can expect to suffer retaliation when china and mexico hit back with tariffs or other sanctions on exports from the united states the tariffs inflict other damage that is harder to measure they generate uncertainty for american businesses over where to buy supplies sell goods or situate factories and offices and they rattle investors and undercut consumer and business confidence file in this march 5 2019 file photo a cargo ship arrives at the port of tacoma in tacoma wash over the past month president donald trump has rolled the dice on the economy he has more than doubled tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports he s preparing to target another 300 billion extending his import taxes to everything china ships to the united states ap photo ted s warren file researchers at ubs calculate that a 25 tariff on all chinese imports would shave a full percentage point from u s growth over the next year the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 and will likely be weaker for 2019 add a 25 tax on mexican goods they say and the united states could tumble into recession for the first time since 2009 the federal reserve has taken notice chairman jerome powell made clear this week that the fed is prepared intervene likely by lowering interest rates if the trade wars were deemed to threaten the expansion still it s far from sure that trump s trade conflicts even if they escalate will imperil the economy pinelopi goldberg chief economist of the world bank and economists pablo fajgelbaum of ucla patrick kennedy of the university of california berkeley and amit khandelwal of columbia university calculated that the economic loss from the trade wars last year amounted a minuscule 0 04 of gross domestic product the broadest gauge of economic output their figure doesn t include the latest tariff threats one reason is that trade accounts for a surprisingly small portion of the economy exports and imports combined equal just 27 of u s gdp the world bank calculates the share is lower in only seven other countries none of them an industrial power like the u s yet despite its modest economic role trade punches above its weight in american political discourse consider the revamped version of the politically contentious north american free trade agreement that the u s negotiated last year with canada and mexico one of trump s policy achievements trump said the new pact the u s mexico canada agreement would create jobs and restore america s status as a manufacturing powerhouse by drawing factories back to the u s from low wage mexico but the independent u s international trade commission analyzed the new agreement and concluded that it would boost the economy by just 68 billion and add 176 000 jobs over six years negligible gains in a 21 trillion economy and a job market exceeding 150 million people likewise said jason furman who served as chairman of president barack obama s council of economic advisers to date most of trump s trade war has been too small to have a large aggregate economic impact that said furman warned that if the china tariffs were extended to all products and if tariffs were also imposed on mexico we could start to actually see the trade war in jobs gdp and other aspects of the economy furman who is now at the harvard kennedy school said he doubts the new tariffs would tip the united states economy into recession but they would certainly help push it in that direction for months businesses and investors have largely convinced themselves that trump would deploy his tariffs only temporarily as leverage to pry concessions from china mexico and others and just over a month ago it looked as if the u s and china were nearing a resolution in their conflict over beijing s aggressive push to overtake american technological dominance but negotiations collapsed and trump ramped up tariffs after the u s side accused beijing of reneging on commitments made earlier in the negotiations even more unsettling was trump s sudden decision to tax mexican imports this came less than two weeks after he d lifted tariffs on mexican and canadian steel and aluminum which had seemed an effort to ease tensions with america s neighbors and persuade their lawmakers to ratify the revamped north american trade agreement people were blindsided by the escalation of tensions with china and mexico said johan gott a principal at the consulting firm a t kearney in the meantime companies like playtime engineering in san francisco which designs and sells blipblox toy music synthesizers assembled in china is bracing for the next round of tariffs on chinese imports we can t just flip a switch and move to a different factory said troy sheets a company co founder it would be nice to know where we should be looking to build our future products playtime might dodge the tariffs by dropping sales in the united states and relying on customers in japan and europe likewise m holland a chicago based distributor of thermoplastic resins said the tariff war is paralyzing its customers which include automakers and packaging manufacturers the company has put off decisions on orders contracts investment and hiring until it knows how the trade conflicts will shake out said dwight morgan an executive vice president for karla klingner ceo of the holding company palindromes the conflict is complicating plans to buy a meat processing plant in the midwest the operation faces a tariff double whammy its pork goes to mexico where workers cut the meat then returns to america crossing the border twice means the pork will likely be hit twice once by trump s tariffs and once by mexico s retaliation we re having to put together plan a plan b plan c klinger said some companies had sought to avoid the tariffs on chinese imports by switching to mexico only to see trump hit mexican imports too there is this creeping sense of paranoia gott said where is really safe ___ rosenberg reported from new york ___ advertisement follow paul wiseman on twitter at
by tayo oke if the united states president donald trump s sentiments and utterances are anything to go by one will have to conclude that all of his predecessors in office have been fools for allowing other countries to take advantage of the us in trade and economic interactions look we build their economy the president claimed of recent in reference to china he said that in total oblivion of the fact that it is the chinese who have been bailing out the us economy for the last decade through the purchase and holding of over a trillion dollar us treasuries government bonds needed to shore up america s manufacturing industry trump would like his electorate to think that in him they have a saviour of american jobs a champion of blue collar workers who would fight to put america first there can be nothing more myopic coming from the leader of the free world a phrase used often prominently by western democratic leaders to massage america s ego in exchange for its nuclear umbrella and a guarantee of free trade past american presidents have been astute enough to understand the potency of the soft power that their leadership of world capitalism gives them it is that even though the us does not get economic parity in many areas of international trade this is ok as long as the rest of the world kow tow to the us strategic vision of the world in other areas it is a delicate balance full of booby traps at times on both sides nonetheless it is what it is unspoken unwritten but glaringly obvious a delicate balance that trump is now busy upending under trump the us has decided to jettison the leader of the free world sobriquet because the sacrifices required to maintain that role are simply too much to bear for the workers or so the president thinks the ongoing trade spat between the us and the chinese telecom giant huawei is emblematic of this shift in focus for america it is an immutable fact that china will soon overtake the us as the largest economy in the world it is an economic dose of reality that grates and irks the neo cons right wing ideologues inside and outside governmental machine in america trump is a willing participant in their chorus of disenchantment of this reality he is even cheerleading their visceral reaction to the impending chinese global economic dominance to them chinese economic expansion may be unstoppable but at least they can use america s current financial leverage globally to clip the wings of the chinese to make life as uncomfortable as possible for them in their march towards the summit of economic power this is effectively the dawn of a new cold economic war in this wise china is being accused of all sorts of economic misdemeanours imaginable currency manipulation price fixing dumping of goods intellectual property theft stifling competition draining developing countries of their natural resources while saddling them with unaffordable debt etc the short response to the above is that yes china is guilty of many of the sins they are alleged to have committed and indeed committing but who says the us or any of its allies in the industrialised west is free of similar sins committed against less powerful nations around the world is it not said that those who live in glass houses should avoid throwing stones if indeed china is exploiting the developing world and stripping them of their resources what has the western world been doing pillaging africa s economic resources for the last two hundred years what is this newfound desire to protect africa s economies from rampaging chinese interest based on anyway is it based on guilt or the fear of losing the continent to chinese influence for the foreseeable future it is within this context that we can best understand the ongoing legal diplomatic tussle involving the us and huawei the us commerce department recently added the company to its entity list which means the us firms will require special permission to engage in business dealings with huawei google is the very latest internet giant to pull out of a deal with china as a result that means huawei will immediately lose access to updates to the android operating system and the next version of its smartphone outside china will also lose access to popular applications and services including the google play store and gmail application a big blow to huawei s bank balance no doubt but it is something that will force them to invent and innovate for alternatives the uk had earlier signed off on letting huawei to help build non core of the country s 5g infrastructure including antennas and other network components despite fears that huawei is a front for the chinese intelligence trump has put pressure on the us allies to desist from doing business with huawei huawei s equipment occupies every step of the network chain between your laptops and phones through to the data centres hosting the content you access according to experts huawei s equipment is especially prominent in the parts of the network closer to the data centres network switches gateways routes and bridges the kit that controls how and where data is sent these core infrastructure devices are said to touch everything traversing the internet and are critical to its functioning based on the foregoing the us and others do have a legitimate concern but it is not one that calls for boycott and killing off a rival huawei s capability for installing surreptitious espionage devices in their system can easily be matched by the us countermeasures in the same terrain as pointed out earlier the us interest in punishing huawei is less about its ability to effectuate security breaches of other countries devices on behalf of the chinese state and more about chipping away at the chinese economic global dominance curtailing it and rendering it less potent than it would otherwise be nigeria is likely to get sucked right into the middle of all this when the us starts instructing us as to which chinese company we should and should not engage with huawei will not be allowed to install the much desired 5g network for us in this country even for free as the us has placed the company on a blacklist with which we are naturally expected to comply in that case a strategic advantage to the us is an economic loss to us america still holds sway on our politics andeconomic life even though they mainly import a small quantity of oil from us they produce the largest barrels in the world on the other hand the bulk of our imports these days are from you guessed it china 31 5 india 8 1 germany 4 7 the uk 3 8 the netherlands 2 6 and france 2 2 that notwithstanding america is home to the imf and the world bank the institutions we mostly rely on for our finances

author richard holden menafn the conversation the facts are not in dispute annual gdp growth has fallen to1 8 on a per capita basis we have had three consecutive quarters of negative growth the last time that happened was during the drought and recession of1982 almost four decades years ago the most recent inflation reading was literallyzero real wage growth has been stagnantfor six years household debt is nearlydoubledisposable income and underemployment ismore than 8 on top of a 5 2 rate of unemployment what is in dispute is what to do about it we ve entered secular stagnation after being been told for years that the economy is in good shape and that we are transitioning away from the mining boom it s time to face the reality that like most advanced economies we are in a low growth low interest rate low inflation trap former us treasury secretary larry summers has argued for some time that advanced economies almost universally are suffering from what he calls secular stagnation a protracted period of low growth caused by too much savings chasing too few productive investment opportunities if the description applies to us and it does there are only two ways to escape it we ve two options one is unconventional monetary policy measures that have the effect that pushing interest rates below zero would have the other is aggressive fiscal policy either big and if necessary repeated tax cuts or a big and if necessary repeated boost in government spending each of which would put thesurplusat risk what would an aggressive enough monetary policy look like the starting point is a concept known as the equilibrium real interest rate it s the real inflation adjusted rate of interest consistent with stable macroeconomic performance which means full employment without financial bubbles 1 aggressive monetary policy there iscompelling evidencethat in advanced economies such as australia the equilibrium real interest rate is negative but getting there in a low inflation environment is hard the reserve bank can if it chooses set the cash rate as low as 0 this week it cut it to 1 25 but it can t safely move it much lower than zero if it did if people and firms found themselves having to pay money in order to keep money in banks they might simply take their money out giving the reserve bank even less control this problem is known as the zero lower bound it means that if the bank needs to cut rates beyond than zero it ll probably have to do something else that has a similar effect the most likely candidate is quantitative easing qe whereby the central bank buys long term government bonds and other securities from investors that have them effectively forcing cash into their hands which the zero interest rate means they have little choice but to spend it shows up in lower longer term interest rates rates for borrowing 5 10 or even 30 years into the future and should boost spending and borrowing just as much as cutting short term rates read more secular stagnation it s time to admit that larry summers was right about this global economic growth trap there are at least three difficulties with qe in australia the first is that because the reserve bank has never done it before there are questions about how it would mechanically execute on it the united states and european experience is helpful in providing a template the second difficulty is getting out nobody including the us federal reserve really knows what happens when qe is unwound third if secular stagnation persists then qe needs to be a long term strategy but is it possible for a central bank to expand its balance sheet buying bonds and securities indefinitely even if it was buying them at a modest pace again nobody knows 2 aggressive fiscal policy if nothing else the headaches with monetary policy suggest that fiscal policy might be an attractive alternative it might also be more effective as reserve bank governor philip lowe notedin a speech on tuesday done in a good way government spending on infrastructure could both boost the economy and boost longer term productivity giving a double benefit it could be complemented by structural policies that support firms expanding investing innovating and employing people it s hard to argue with lowe s logic so hard in fact that some of us have been sayingexactly what he just said for some time a quicker way to boost the economy would be to splash cash either as kevin rudd did in the form of cash payments during the global financial crisis or in the form oftax offsetsof the kind the morrison government announced in the 2018 and 2019 budgets read more it s the budget cash splash that reaches back in time delivered straight into bank accounts both havemuch the same effect even though one is classified as spending and the other as cutting tax the obstacle to doing such things is this government s make that this country s obsession with balanced budgets the surplus can wait i haveargued stronglyand still believe that debt and deficits do matter but at the moment we are in serious danger of falling into recession that makes it imperative to act given the politics of budget deficits and the narratives around economic management it might be that the burden of action falls on the organisation the least able to pull it off in the present circumstances that s the reserve bank if australia does dip into recession in the next year or two it will be an unforced error not only would the government be responsible for it by not having taken strong enough action on spending when it could the bank would also be responsible by taking action too late and letting things get to the stage where it had to act while interest rates were near zero read more expect weak economic growth for quite some time what wednesday s national accounts tell us gdp quantitative easing secular stagnation qe federal budget 2019

open this photo in gallery in this file photo taken on june 5 2019 window cleaners work on a building in washington nicholas kamm afp getty images u s job growth slowed sharply in may and wages rose less than expected raising fears that a loss of momentum in economic activity could be spreading to the labour market which could put pressure on the federal reserve to cut interest rates this year the broad cool off in hiring reported by the labor department on friday was before a recent escalation in trade tensions between the united states and two of its major trading partners china and mexico analysts have warned the trade fights could undermine the economy which will celebrate 10 years of expansion next month the longest on record adding a sting to the closely watched employment report far fewer jobs were created in march and april than previously reported indicating that hiring had shifted into a lower gear the labour market thus far has been largely resilient to the trade war with china today s report makes a cut more likely and supports our view that the trade tensions will ultimately slow growth enough for the fed to respond in september and december with cuts said joseph song an economist at bank of america merrill lynch in new york nonfarm payrolls increased by 75 000 jobs last month the government said it was the second time this year that job gains dropped below 100 000 economists polled by reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 185 000 jobs last month job growth in march and april was revised down by 75 000 president donald trump in early may slapped additional tariffs of up to 25 on 200 billion of chinese goods which prompted retaliation by beijing last week trump said he would impose a tariff on all goods from mexico to force authorities in that country to stop immigrants from central america from crossing the border into the united states talks to prevent the duties from kicking in at 5 on june 10 continue fed chairman jerome powell said on tuesday the u s central bank was closely monitoring the implications of the trade tensions on the economy and would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion trump who has routinely tweeted about the strong labour market made no comment about may s weak hiring but defended duties on chinese goods white house economic adviser kevin hassett told fox business network that bad weather in the midwest was to blame and described the meagre job gains as a little bit of a blip down economists however said there was nothing to suggest the weather was the culprit the weakness in job growth was broadly experienced across industry groups and not obviously driven by distortions such as weather or strikes said michael feroli an economist at jpmorgan in new york u s house of representative speaker nancy pelosi a democrat said the employment report was a disturbing sign that the administration s disastrous special interest agenda is hollowing out our economy following the report financial markets priced in a rate cut as early as july and two more later this year economists however believe the fed will probably wait for more signs of labour market weakness and clarity on the trade issues before easing monetary policy fed officials are due to meet on june 18 19 fed officials are likely to remain cautious at the june meeting and keep all their options open said michael hanson head of global macro strategy at td securities in new york the dollar fell to a 2 1 2 month low against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices rose stocks on wall street were trading higher worker shortages last month s slowdown in job gains however probably understates the labour market s health as layoffs remain low employment gains over the last three months have averaged 151 000 above the roughly 100 000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working age population in the four months since the first hiccup in hiring appeared in february however monthly payrolls gains have averaged just 127 000 the slowest pace over a comparable stretch in nearly seven years some of the weakness in hiring could be because of worker shortages especially in the construction transportation and manufacturing sectors but the worker shortage argument is somewhat undercut by moderate wage growth average hourly earnings grew just 3 1 year over year the slowest annual increase since september just three months earlier wages had been rising at their fastest rate in a decade but gains have moderated since the tepid employment report added to soft data on consumer spending business investment manufacturing and homes sales in suggesting the economy was losing momentum in the second quarter following a temporary boost from exports inventory accumulation and defence spending growth is cooling as the massive stimulus from last year s tax cuts and spending increases fades the atlanta fed is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 1 4 annualized rate in the second quarter the economy grew at a 3 1 pace in the first quarter the unemployment rate remained near a 50 year low of 3 6 in may a broader measure of unemployment which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment dropped to 7 1 last month the lowest since december 2000 hiring slowed across all sectors in may with the share of industries showing job gains during the month the smallest since july 2016 manufacturing payrolls increased by 3 000 last month after gaining 5 000 positions in april the sector is struggling with an inventory overhang that has resulted in businesses placing fewer orders at factories employers in the construction sector hired 4 000 workers in may after adding 30 000 jobs to payrolls in april professional and business services employment rose by 33 000 transportation and warehousing payrolls fell as did retail employment government shed 15 000 jobs the most in 16 months
menafn gulf times central bankers in the united states and other rich nations should take more account of the impact their policies have on emerging economies bank of england governor mark carney said yesterday while it is unrealistic to expect advanced economy policymakers to internalise fully spillovers from their actions on emerging markets given their domestic mandates their monetary policies will increasingly need to take account of spillbacks he said the united states only accounted for 15 of global economic output but the us dollar was used in more than half of international trade and the dollar acted as a monetary anchor for economies amounting to 70 of global output carney said this means developments in the us have disproportionate influence on global economic and financial conditions he told bankers at the institute of international finance which is meeting in tokyo when the fed responds to domestic developments such as a loosening in fiscal policy global financial conditions and activity react strongly this was the case during both the 2013 taper tantrum and over the past year as fed communications significantly shifted expectations for us monetary policy last month carney said financial markets had priced in too little chance of further boe interest rate rises assuming brexit goes smoothly partly due to global factors pushing down bond yields since then increased us china trade tensions and continued brexit uncertainty has meant markets now appear to think the bank of england is more likely to have to cut rates over the next year than to raise them emerging markets should preserve central bank independence avoid excessive lending growth and rely less on foreign denominated debt to prepare for any future downturn carney added fiscal space will need to be used carefully given ongoing structural imperatives the rising risks of global shocks and the clear limits of monetary policy he said turkey and south africa are among countries which have suffered currency volatility in recent months as foreign investors questioned the independence of their central banks on wednesday a faction loyal to south africa s president cyril ramaphosa opposed calls from a rival group within the ruling anc party for the country s bank to do more to boost employment and growth carney also warned of the potentially destabilising effect if foreign funds that invested in illiquid emerging market debt saw a surge in demand for withdrawals from investors global regulators were looking at whether funds should be required to have redemption periods that better matched the time it would take to sell assets in an orderly way he said several british real estate funds temporarily stopped investors withdrawing money after 2016 s brexit referendum and this week a fund focused on british companies run by high profile investor neil woodford suspended withdrawals menafn0606201900670000id1098617531
