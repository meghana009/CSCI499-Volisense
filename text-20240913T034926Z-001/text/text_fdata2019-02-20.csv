likely to remain relatively stable thus providing a basis from which to form forecasts and projections not to mention high liquidity and ease of access in terms of broker availability nevertheless right down at the other end of the scale dwell a host of currencies which trade in the hundreds thousands or in some cases tens of thousands to the pound sterling gbp not to demean the greenback s 2018 bullish rally which saw the us dollar usd appreciate by 10 against a basket of peers for some of the currencies listed below exchange rate fluctuations into the tens of percent range annually is par for the course 1 54 867 iranian rialover the course of recent years the iranian rial irr has depreciated vastly against most peers with further depreciation expected as the oil producing nation continues to struggle with international sanctions headed by the united states prompted by concerns over the middle eastern nation s work towards nuclear armament iranian access to commodity markets has been severely curbed which alongside a embargo on oil imports from the nation caused a substantial downturn in the iranian economy from a january 2017 low of 38871 1 todays pound to rial gbpirr exchange rate of 54867 7 represents a 41 15 rise in the rate in favour of the pound sterling gbp 1 30 285 vietnamese dongeconomic and political reforms under đổi mới launched in the late 1980s have seen tectonic economic shifts for the asian nation shifting away from a centrally planned to market economy has seen the country transformed from one of the poorest nations in the world to one of the most dynamic ems in east asia boosting the country into the lower middle income category despite continued domestic reforms which are expected to further boost the economy over the coming years the vietnamese dong vnd remains a cheap buy against the pound sterling gbp with 1 equating to 30285 vnd 1 18 311 indonesian rupiah idr despite being the largest economy in southeast asia and a confidently middle income nation the indonesian rupiah remains one of the weakest currencies globally in terms of the exchange rate which is even more surprising when you factor in that the nation is the world s 10th largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity based on the current pound to rupiah gbpidr exchange rate 1 is worth 18 311 idr having gained more than 14 since january of 2017 however the idr may be one of the cases of get it while it s cheap a progressive 20 year economic development plan has seen the southeast asian nation make startling progress initiated in 2005 and now in its third phase which focuses on infrastructure development as well as reforms in education and healthcare the development plan has seen the poverty rate halved while the economy grows from strength to strength 1 11 947 guinean francsthe west african nation of guinea holds one of the weakest currencies globally with 1 worth 11 947 guinean francs gnf according to the world bank gross domestic product for guinea remains squarely in the black with 2017 growth slated at 8 2 the nation benefits from an abundance of mineable resources as well as a solid agricultural sector despite the positives guinea remains an extremely poor nation with many challenges ahead suggesting a favourable gbp rate may be on the cards for some time to come 1 11 200 5 laotian kipthe lao people s democratic republic lao has a surprisingly weak currency exchange rate given the nation is one of the fastest growing economies in east asia and the pacific improved access to electricity schools roads and other infrastructure have allowed laos to carve itself an important role as an energy exporter over recent years over the last decade economic growth has averaged 7 8 per annum despite the positives the lao

pound sterling to sierra leonean leone gbpsll exchange rate of 1 to 11 450 sierra leonean leone the african nation s currency earns its place amongst the weakest currencies around the globe despite remarkable reforms the nation still struggles with poor infrastructure and widespread impoverishment with a history plagued by conflict sierra leone has in recent years seen relative peace prevail however a contentious 2018 general election alongside lingering post conflict effects including high youth unemployment corruption and weak governance have contributed to extended losses for the ssl against the gbp over recent year with the gbp ssl gaining over 106 from mid 2016 to present nevertheless prior to the ebola outbreak of 2014 sierra leone was on track to attain middle income status by 2035 however the redirection of resources to deal with the ebola outbreak means this date will likely be pushed back 1 10 967 uzbekistani somwhile the 400 increase in the pound sterling gbp to uzbekistani som uzs exchange rate between 2005 and 2016 would earn it the title of one of the highest gaining fx crosses over recent decades accelerating depreciation for the uzs through 2017 has left the uzbekistani som nigh worthless against the pound sterling with a current rate of 1 to 10967 uzs interestingly the 2017 wave of depreciation occurred with the uzbek government s launch of an ambitious program of market oriented reforms that are unprecedented in the country s modern history according to the world bank the government s national development strategy for 2017 21 aims to transform the country by liberalizing the economy reshaping the role of the state in the economy modernizing the agriculture sector strengthening governance creating markets including in financial services enabling private sector growth investing in human capital and improving social protection and service delivery for all citizens 1 7 944 paraguayan guaranirecent years has seen the south american nation outperform its regional comparators in terms of economic growth averaging gross domestic product gbp growth of around 4 5 per annum over the last decade with poverty more than halving and wage growth for the lowest 40 of the population accelerating to 4 5 growth annually nevertheless the paraguayan guarani pyg remains an exceptionally cheap buy against the pound sterling gbp with the gbp pyg exchange rate currently at 7946 which actually represents a decline from the late 2015 high of 8836 1 5 206 cambodian rieldespite over two decades of consistent robust economic growth which saw the cambodian economy maintain an average growth rate of 7 7 1995 2017 and even clinch the title of the sixth fastest growing economy in the world the cambodian riel remains remarkably cheap against the pound sterling gbp the current pound to riel gbpkhr exchange rate of 5206 khr to 1 gbp represents a markedly more riel favourable rate compared to five years ago when the gbp hkr exchange rate was closer to the 7000 level 1 4 284 sovereign bolivarsfaced with a crumbling economy and hyperinflation which saw the soberano s predecessor suffer from inflation to the tune of almost 1 7million through h1 2018 august 2018 saw the south american nation s president micolas madura announces the replacement of the bolivar fuerte vef with the bolivar soberano ves with a rate of 1ves to 100 000 vef pegging the ves to the national cryptocurrency the petro nevertheless worsening political turmoil and a power struggle for leadership exacerbated by foreign intervention has seen the newly appointed venezuelan currency continue to depreciate vastly against global peers earning it to the top spot on the weakest currencies of 2019 so far following an initial valuation of around 3 2 ves to 1 in august 2018 the gbp ves breached the 100 00 exchange rate before the year end before surging at an astronomical rate through december and into 2019 at the time of writing 1 is currently worth 4 290 39 sovereign bolivar ves up an astounding 133 974 1 4 065 colombian pesosthe colombian economy has faced a number of challenges over recent years but by and large has emerged unscathed trade shock between 2014 and 2016 saw economic growth decelerate sharply to 1 8 in 2017 with the country s oil fiscal revenue declining by 3 3 of gdp president iván duque márquez s austere policy measures allowed the economic slowdown a soft landing supported by sound macroeconomic policies and domestic structural reforms looking ahead growth is expected to pick up over the 2019 2020 period driven by stronger private consumption rebounding oil prices and a recovery in non oil exports rounding off the list the colombian peso is by no means expensive with the pound to peso gbpcop rate currently at 4065 pesos

the capitalists are heading towards another economic crisis click to enlarge opens in new window 2018 marked ten years since the collapse of lehman brothers bank which plunged the world economy into the deepest economic recession since the 1930s the financial virus spread quickly causing production and trade to seize up only swift coordinated action by world capitalists and political leaders averted a 1930s style depression the triggers for the crisis included excessive state corporate and household debt levels reckless speculation in us sub prime mortgages and a collapse in the largely unregulated international derivatives market described by economists as financial weapons of mass destruction panic spread across borders as european banks ran out of dollars needed to repay their dollar denominated borrowing prompting the us federal reserve to inject 11 trillion of liquidity to keep the system afloat however even this sum was dwarfed by china s simultaneous stimulus package renewed crisis last month at the annual get together of billionaires in davos little optimism was visible as a whole array of geopolitical economic and social problems rose up like spectres before them a potent symbol of the growing fracturing of the capitalist world order was the absence of donald trump french president emmanuel macron and theresa may all grounded at home to firefight the explosive issues of the us shutdown the gilets jaunes yellow vests protest movement and brexit respectively davos laid bare the concerns of the world s rulers forced to acknowledge clear signs of a slowing world economy a dangerous ramping up of trade battles between the us and china the lowest chinese growth rate in almost 30 years a simmering developing world debt crisis recession in italy and the possibility of a no deal brexit that will have damaging and uncertain international impacts the total cost across the west of recapitalising broken banks and underwriting their debts exceeded 14 trillion by slashing interest rates to historical lows and creating quantitative easing which allowed central banks to purchase securities from the market in order to increase the money supply a full blown collapse of the economic system was narrowly prevented these emergency measures have not created a sustainable recovery however instead they have assisted in inflating booming asset prices and in many countries consumer debt has soared back to pre 2008 levels the real causes of the last crash have been ignored the total value of global debt in both the public and private sectors has now reached an all time high of 182 trillion twice last year there were panics on wall street as fears of ebbing growth and the impact of tighter us monetary policy took hold in february 4 trillion was wiped from the world s stock markets in just two days later the rebound in the us was spectacular yet between october 2018 and january 2019 the falls have recommenced with 20 of share market value evaporating despite assurances from big banks that they have cleaned up their acts unnerving parallels lurk the largest world banks have become bigger with the percentage of assets held by the big five increasing creating fears that they remain too important to be allowed to fail in another severe downturn in february last year us hedge fund manager chris cole took a break from his job of making millions out of financial hedging to comment cynically the entire global system is an ouroborus a snake eating its own tail we are going to have a full blown financial crisis on the same level as the last one if not worse one sign of the depleted credit quality of international markets is the deterioration globally in median bond ratings since 1980 they have dropped from a to bbb just one notch above junk status trade wars trump s presidency has added a dangerous new unpredictability to an already volatile situation trade tensions between the us and china remain unresolved and may worsen in march he has railed against china with allegations of cyber espionage accusing beijing of us property rights theft although the us s economic clashes with mexico and canada over the north america free trade agreement nafta have receded for now the eu was hit with tariffs of 25 on imported steel and 10 on aluminium last march and retaliated with counter tariffs in june these naked protectionist measures further complicate already strained inter imperialist geopolitical relations tariffs push up the cost of imports add to business costs and eat into profits reduction in global growth has a knock on effect on us exports trump thunders against perceived anti us bias in the world trade organisation wto created 20 years ago when confident capitalists believed globalisation was irreversible in an interview with bloomberg in september he threatened if they don t shape up i would withdraw from the wto today s international trade tensions underline a shift that has been developing since 2008 and is fanned by right wing populist politicians who demagogically attack globalisation and its institutions including the eu demanding a return to protecting national interests in its 24 january edition the economist refers to this era of partial retreat into protectionism as one of slobalisation noting that the global value of cross border investment by multinational companies fell by about 20 in 2018 alone a handbrake is being applied to world trade which coupled with the current us backlash against international agreements further undermines prospects for a coordinated response to any future economic crisis us economy indicative of growing uncertainties is the barely concealed rift between trump and the us central bank over the issue of interest rates and the sustainability of the recovery the us economy appears robust growing by 4 1 in the last quarter yet average growth rate in the current expansion phase is 2 2 paltry next to the 4 9 a year on average during the 1960s or even the 3 6 achieved in the 1990s this recovery is the first business cycle since 1945 in which there has not been a single year of growth above 3 since 2014 the dollar has risen by nearly 25 buoyed by a stronger domestic performance and rising interest rates this has severely damaged developing market economies which have seen dollars leaving their shores to chase higher us interest rates turkey and argentina have already been prominent casualties of this process trump has slashed corporate taxation from 35 to 21 indicating their lack of confidence in the long term profitability of manufacturing investment however many big us companies have used these windfalls to buy back their own shares and thus sit on huge cash piles as the fed reverses the bond buying quantitative easing qe programme the us now faces quantitative tightening qt while qe helped to sustain the boom in asset prices shares and property qt will do the opposite some us financial indicators are beginning to flash amber and many economists now believe a big market correction is lurking this may originate in the financial sector perhaps this time triggered by distress in the exchange traded fund market financial products that offer risk diversification in trading houses governed by algorithms that can move the us treasury bond market 10 in ten minutes these instruments remain untested and susceptible to the effects of large scale panic selling trump believes he can win another term on his record of presiding over a strong economy however he may well face the prospect of fighting for re election during a recession tech giant apple s profit warning last month was a harbinger of things to come when us treasury secretary steve mnuchin suddenly stated in december that banks have ample liquidity markets responded with palpable fear china syndrome china s slowdown also creates new tensions it produces 16 of global gdp total output today compared to 6 in 2008 but in the same period has seen its debt balloon from 150 of gdp to 300 us tariffs have hit the chinese economy hard and an additional 300 billion is threatened in march unless beijing concedes further ground china is acutely vulnerable to a full scale trade war social tensions are rising with over 1 700 industrial strikes or protests in 2018 the vast majority of which are linked to lay offs from debt ridden enterprises while it is not possible to be precise about either the immediate causes or the timescale for the coming recession nor even its severity it is apparent that a swift and committed response by capitalist governments to fighting its impacts will be more difficult to achieve this time given the increasingly fragmented capitalist world prospects there may be a stock market crash higher interest rates may ignite debt crises in over extended developing countries banking collapses may cause a financial meltdown or there can be an oil shock arising from political upheaval through us meddling in iran having reduced interest rates to historical lows after 2008 and loaded up the world economy with qe debt the depleted stock of financial firepower in finance ministries and central banks makes a future downturn or crash a potentially more fraught affair compounding all capitalism s pre existing structural weaknesses is the shocking report from the un s intergovernmental panel on climate change which warns the world has only 12 years to take the necessary steps to avert a global warming disaster the working class was largely stunned and ill prepared to mount a fightback after 2008 deceived and abandoned by treacherous former social democratic parties who had bought into the idea of the infallibility of the market betrayals in greece and elsewhere have meant that capitalism has bailed itself out on our backs and through our wallets next time will be different workers and youth already becoming radicalised around the world will fight back and forge new mass workers parties that will end the rule of capital rather than submit to it the programme of marxism will be taken up internationally arming the new generation with the political weapons that can finally dispatch the dictatorship of the market into the dustbin for ever
for the past few decades there s been a rough consensus about how to run a modern capitalist economy trade should be free the gold standard is archaic antitrust should protect consumers rather than punish bigness tax rates should be modestly higher for the rich government should run big deficits during recessions to support growth but get frugal during good times to reduce debt republicans and democrats didn t agree on everything but the economists in their respective brain trusts shared a general understanding of how to build prosperity that centrist consensus is losing its power republicans are being drawn toward the protectionism of president trump democrats toward the socialism of representative alexandria ocasio cortez the freshman congresswoman from new york city trust in the establishment is low leaving people open to alternatives whether they come from the left or the right says patrick egan a new york university political scientist people are open to change and new ideas in a pretty substantial way

growth and margins are expected to normalize in the steel industry after a very strong 2018 global steel prices have been decreasing over the last few months and the iron ore market has become more challenging with rising costs for steel makers under these market conditions ternium will continue working on increasing efficiency at its operations and reducing production costs with the aim of maintaining its consistent margin leadership in the americas global steel overcapacity continues to be a risk to fair trade as steel production in china continues to increase and its economy is decelerating many countries around the world reacted to this situation putting in place safeguard duties to prevent damage to their industries this is causing a diversion of steel exports to less protected markets something that was evidenced by the recent increase in latin america s participation among china s main export destinations the expected ratification of the united states mexico canada agreement usmca in 2019 and the eventual agreement on section 232 import tariffs among the current nafta partners should help normalize steel trade flows in this region this result would have a positive effect on ternium s business in mexico which is the company s main steel market as current trade conditions are placing undue strain on the mexican market in 2019 expectations of growth in the united states should create a healthy environment for the mexican manufacturing industry although weak public and private investment in mexico will continue to negatively affect the country s construction market advertisement advertisement ternium expects ebitda to decrease slightly in the first quarter 2019 compared to the fourth quarter 2018 as a result of lower margin partially offset by higher shipments with an increased participation of slabs in the sales mix the company anticipates ebitda per ton to sequentially decrease in the first quarter 2019 mainly due to lower revenue per ton in mexico after the reset of industrial customer contract prices and slightly lower prices in the spot market while cost per ton should remain relatively stable analysis of full year 2018 results

all in sustaining costs at individual mine sites 6 includes capital spending at cerro pelon and la yaqui grande of approximately 33 million the company s long term strategic objective is to generate increasing cash flow through low cost production growth from its existing operations and portfolio of development projects in 2018 the company produced a record 505 000 ounces of gold an 18 increase from 2017 driven by strong operational performances from both island gold and mulatos since 2014 alamos has transformed from a single asset producer with 140 000 ounces of annualized production to producing 505 000 ounces from four operating mines this transformational growth has been accomplished while also improving margins through lower operating costs looking forward the company anticipates a substantial reduction in growth capital in 2020 and beyond and a further reduction in costs which will lead to strong free cash flow growth in 2018 the company continued to execute on its various internal growth initiatives this included advancing the lower mine expansion at young davidson as well as the successful completion of the phase i expansion at island gold while also delivering a significant increase in mineral reserves and resources which will support future expansions within the development pipeline the permits for the cerro pelon project in mexico were received in 2018 and construction has now commenced in addition the gsm permit for the kirazlı project in turkey was received with full scale construction anticipated to commence following the receipt of the operating license the company expects a similar level of production in 2019 relative to 2018 with total cash costs and all in sustaining costs expected to decrease 9 and 5 respectively based on the mid point of guidance driven by operational improvements at young davidson and low cost production growth at island gold costs and capital are expected to decline through the year driving stronger mine site free cash flow in the second half of the year the near term focus at young davidson remains on maximizing efficiency from the upper mine infrastructure while completing development and construction of the lower mine gold production at young davidson is expected to increase slightly in 2019 to a range of 180 000 to 190 000 ounces compared to 2018 production of 180 000 ounces total cash costs and mine site all in sustaining costs are expected to decrease 6 compared to 2018 driven by higher underground mining rates and grades mined young davidson s 2019 guidance for production mining rates operating costs and capital are all consistent with its average performance over the past two years capital spending at young davidson is expected to total 80 to 90 million consistent with 2018 spending will be focused on completing development and infrastructure of the lower mine as well as starting construction of a newly permitted tailings facility tia 1 the company successfully completed permitting of tia 1 during the fourth quarter of 2018 with receipt of the schedule 2 amendment from the federal government tia 1 will provide sufficient capacity for the remaining mineral reserves and resources at young davidson at substantially lower costs than the current facility gold production from young davidson is expected to decrease in 2020 reflecting approximately three months of downtime of the northgate shaft to complete the tie in of the upper and lower mines this will temporarily limit underground throughput and impact three months of production during the first half of 2020 following completion of the tie in underground mining rates are expected to ramp up above 7 500 tpd in the second half of 2020 and towards the long term target of 8 000 tpd in 2021 this is expected to drive annual gold production above 200 000 ounces per year in 2021 and beyond combined with declining costs and capital spending the company expects strong free cash flow growth from young davidson starting in the second half of 2020 island gold is expected to produce between 135 000 to 145 000 ounces in 2019 a 32 increase relative to the previous record in 2018 reflecting higher grades and throughput with the completion of the phase i expansion last year combined with an expected 19 decrease in total cash costs and 4 decrease in mine site all in sustaining costs island gold is expected to generate strong free cash flow growth in 2019 net of a continued significant investment of 19 million in exploration to further expand mineral reserves and resources capital spending at island gold is expected to total 50 to 60 million in 2019 consistent with 2018 this includes 35 to 40 million of sustaining capital with underground development being accelerated to bring the significant growth in mineral reserves and resources into the mine plan as well as support mining rates above 1 100 tpd lateral exploration development has also been increased to support the expanded exploration program the phase i expansion at island gold was completed in september 2018 expanding the mill to a design capacity of approximately 1 200 tpd the current mine infrastructure can support similar mining rates however the operation is currently permitted to operate at an average annual rate of 1 100 tpd with a mine and mill that can support higher throughput rates the company is in the process of permitting an amendment to 1 200 tpd which is expected to be received by the end of 2019 as part of a phase ii expansion in parallel the company has started an evaluation of a potential phase iii expansion of the operation beyond 1 200 tpd total production from the mulatos district is expected to be between 150 000 to 160 000 ounces of gold in 2019 consistent with long term guidance provided in january 2018 mulatos significantly outperformed this production range in 2018 reflecting higher than expected recoveries at la yaqui and mulatos and extended production from the high grade san carlos underground deposit which reached the end of its mine life in the third quarter of 2018 mine site all in sustaining costs are expected to decrease relative to 2018 guidance of 900 per ounce reflecting the end of the 5 royalty early in 2019 mine site all in sustaining costs are expected to increase slightly from 2018 with the operation having outperformed in 2018 given the above noted factors capital spending across the mulatos district is expected to total 50 to 55 million in 2019 including 5 million of sustaining capital this increased from 2018 reflecting 25 million budgeted in 2019 for development of the cerro pelon project cerro pelon is higher grade higher return project and is expected to start contributing low cost production in 2020 mining activities ceased at el chanate in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the operation has transitioned to residual leaching which will result in a declining rate of production through 2019 mine site all in sustaining costs are expected to average 1 200 per ounce in 2019 with approximately 25 of those costs having been already incurred development capital spending in 2019 will be primarily focused on the construction of the kirazlı project with the bulk of the remainder comprised of capitalized exploration at island gold and exploration permitting and development activities at lynn lake the 2019 global exploration budget is 33 million down slightly from the 2018 budget reflecting lower exploration spending at mulatos island gold continues to be the main focus of exploration with 19 million budgeted an increase from the 2018 initial budget of 15 million mulatos and lynn lake remain the other two areas of focus with 6 million budgeted for each with over 600 million of cash and available liquidity no debt and growing cash flow from its

revised production guidance with strong fourth quarter production of 50 900 ounces of gold this was lower than the comparative quarter of 2017 however a 4 improvement from the third quarter of 2018 and the highest quarterly production of the year reflecting higher underground mining rates and grades full year production of 180 000 ounces decreased 10 from 2017 primarily due to unscheduled downtime encountered in the first half of 2018 to both the northgate hoist and the mill underground mining rates increased to 6 402 tpd in the fourth quarter a 7 increase from the third quarter and in line with revised near term guidance of 6 500 tpd until the tie in of the lower mine in the first half of 2020 is completed for the full year underground mining rates were below prior year rates at 6 248 tpd due to temporary ore pass challenges experienced in the first half of the year and eight days of downtime to the northgate shaft in the second quarter underground mining rates are expected to increase substantially in the second half of 2020 following completion of the lower mine tie in underground grades mined also improved significantly to 2 71 g t au in the fourth quarter a 5 increase from the third quarter and the highest grades of the year underground grades mined of 2 51 g t au for the year were slightly below guided levels and reserve grade of 2 69 g t au due primarily to mine sequencing mill throughput increased to a record 745 567 tonnes or 8 104 tpd in the fourth quarter an 11 increase from the third quarter bringing full year mill throughput to 7 353 tpd mill throughput is expected to average 7 800 tpd in the first half of 2019 before decreasing to match underground mining rates in the second half of the year once lower grade surface stockpiles have been depleted mill recoveries of 92 in the quarter and year to date were in line with expectations and the prior year period financial review fourth quarter revenues of 64 4 million were consistent with the comparative prior year quarter and 12 higher than the third quarter of 2018 reflecting higher ounces sold and a higher realized gold price revenues of 236 3 million in 2018 were 13 4 million lower than the prior year due to a 6 decline in ounces sold partially offset by a higher realized gold price cost of sales which reflects mining and processing costs royalties and amortization expense of 61 5 million were higher than the comparative quarter of 2017 reflecting higher per tonne underground mining costs and processing costs for 2018 cost of sales were 235 0 million an increase of 21 6 million due to higher underground mining costs primarily attributable to increased maintenance and input costs total cash costs decreased to 764 per ounce in the fourth quarter down 7 from the third quarter and the lowest quarterly costs in 2018 total cash costs were 11 higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 due to lower grades processed and a higher mining cost per tonne mining costs of cad 51 per tonne in the quarter were above budget reflecting the impact of lower mining rates on fixed costs as well as higher diesel and maintenance costs total cash costs of 822 per ounce for 2018 were 25 higher than the prior year period reflecting 7 lower grades mined and a 16 increase in mining cost per tonne mine site aisc also decreased to 974 per ounce in the fourth quarter down 5 from the third quarter for the full year mine site aisc averaged 1 017 per ounce mine site aisc were 13 and 22 higher than the prior year quarter and prior year respectively reflecting higher total cash costs and higher sustaining capital total cash costs and mine site aisc are both expected to decrease by approximately 6 in 2019 capital expenditures were 23 1 million in the fourth quarter higher than the same quarter of 2017 this included 10 8 million of sustaining capital and 12 3 million of growth capital major capital spending in the fourth quarter was focused on lower mine development and lateral development in the upper and lower mines capital expenditures of 86 6 million for the twelve month period were higher than the prior year period and guidance reflecting increased spending on tailings and water management young davidson generated mine site free cash flow of 0 5 million in the fourth quarter and 10 9 million for the full year lower than the same periods of 2017 due to less ounces

production meeting the mid point of revised guidance which had been increased twice during the year underground mining rates increased to 102 692 tonnes or 1 116 tpd in the fourth quarter this marked a 37 improvement from the third quarter as mining rates were increased to match the expanded mill capacity for the full year 344 336 tonnes were mined or 943 tpd with mining rates in line with milling capacity prior to completing the mill expansion underground mining rates are expected to average 1 100 tpd in 2019 a 17 increase from average mining rates of 943 tpd in 2018 underground grades mined averaged 8 95 g t au in the fourth quarter and 9 07 g t au for the full year the latter above guidance reflecting a positive grade reconciliation mill throughput increased to a new record of 105 432 tonnes or 1 146 tpd in the fourth quarter reflecting the completion of the phase i expansion of the mill in september 2018 this marked a 13 increase compared to the third quarter and 25 increase compared to the prior year quarter the phase i expansion has increased the design capacity of the mill to approximately 1 200 tpd however the operation is currently permitted to operate at an average

the acquisition date has not been included in the comparative table above island gold generated revenues of 37 5 million in the fourth quarter reflecting record gold production and ounces sold revenues for the year were 135 1 million compared to 14 9 million in the prior year which was a partial period cost of sales in the fourth quarter and for the full year were 28 7 million and 106 5 million respectively cost of sales includes ongoing amortization charges related to the purchase price of the asset which increases amortization to approximately 375 per ounce based on current mineral reserves and resources total cash costs were 570 per ounce in the fourth quarter a 15 improvement from the third quarter of 2018 reflecting lower per tonne mining costs driven by higher mining rates full year total cash costs of 589 per ounce were slightly above annual guidance of 575 per ounce reflecting higher underground mining costs partially offset by higher grades mined total cash costs are expected to decrease approximately 19 in 2019 driven by higher grades mined and mining rates mine site aisc of 834 per ounce in the fourth quarter were slightly above annual guidance of 825 per ounce primarily reflecting the timing of sustaining capital as spending was below budget for the first half of the year full year mine site aisc of 781 per ounce were below full year guidance reflecting higher production and lower sustaining capital capital expenditures totaled 16 8 million in the fourth quarter with spending focused primarily on lateral development mining equipment and capitalized

ounces in the fourth quarter a decrease from the first three quarters of the year as mining from the san carlos underground deposit ceased in the third quarter for the full year mulatos produced 175 500 ounces meeting the mid point of revised guidance which was increased twice during the year mulatos outperformed initial guidance and budget with the san carlos underground mine operating approximately six months longer than expected as well as higher than budgeted heap leach recoveries from both mulatos and la yaqui phase i with no further production from san carlos the company expects 2019 production to return to the previously guided long term range of 150 000 to 160 000 ounces total tonnes mined in the fourth quarter were 6 lower than the prior year quarter due to an unexpected pit slope movement in the el salto area of the open pit which temporarily impacted access to the mulatos pit on a year to date basis total tonnes mined were 11 higher than 2017 reflecting a full year of mining at la yaqui phase i compared to one quarter in the prior year the waste to ore ratio of 0 51 1 was lower than the prior year quarter and guidance total crusher throughput averaged 19 300 tpd for a total of 1 776 719 tonnes stacked in the fourth quarter at a grade of 0 92 g t au both in line with the prior year period total crusher throughput and grade for the year was also in line with the prior year period and slightly above guidance the recovery ratio of ounces produced to contained ounces stacked and milled was 68 in the quarter compared to 72 in the prior year period for the full year the recovery ratio of 81 significantly outperformed guidance of 75 resulting in stronger production for the year the company expects a recovery ratio of 70 in 2019 financial review fourth quarter revenues of 48 1 million were 15 9 million lower than the prior year quarter primarily due to lower concentrate ounces sold in 2018 with the completion of mining at san carlos in september revenues for 2018 were 223 3 million an 11 increase from the prior year due to higher realized gold prices and ounces sold cost of sales of 38 4 million in the fourth quarter were lower than the prior year period due to lower tonnes mined in the open pit and the completion of underground mining at san carlos for the full year of 2018 cost of sales of 173 1 million were higher than the prior year reflecting higher total tonnes mined and increased amortization related to mining at la yaqui phase i total cash costs of 793 per ounce in the fourth quarter were higher than 762 per ounce in the prior year quarter as a result of lower recoveries partially offset by a lower strip ratio total cash costs averaged 786 per ounce in 2018 below full year guidance of 800 per ounce and consistent with 2017 costs of 775 per ounce mine site aisc in the fourth quarter of 881 per ounce were higher than the 798 per ounce reported in the prior year quarter due to timing of sustaining capital spending and higher cash costs mine site aisc averaged 855 per ounce in 2018 below guidance of 900 per ounce and consistent with the prior year period mulatos generated mine site free cash flow of 2 9 million in the fourth quarter and 35 7 million for the full year driven by stronger than expected production and increased operating margins a portion of mulatos strong cash flow in 2018

the company does not include an allocation of corporate and administrative and share based compensation expenses 4 grams per tonne of gold g t au el chanate produced 10 100 ounces of gold in the fourth quarter of 2018 down from 12 100 ounces in the prior year quarter as the operation has transitioned to residual leaching in the quarter mining activities ceased at el chanate on october 30 2018 the company expects to recover between 15 000 and 25 000 ounces in 2019 through residual leaching financial review fourth quarter revenues of 13 1 million were lower than the prior year quarter due to fewer ounces sold as mining activities wound down during the period revenues for 2018 of 57 1 million were down from 76 8 million in the prior year period due to a lower realized gold price and ounces sold during the fourth quarter the company reviewed the heap leach pad inventory at the el chanate mine as the operation transitioned to residual leaching activities this included an analysis of the number of ounces included in inventory on the heap leach pad that are expected to be recovered economically it was determined that approximately 51 900 ounces are not economically recoverable as a result the company incurred a non cash inventory impairment charge of 64 0 million pre tax which has been included in cost of sales total cash costs per ounce of 1 304 for the fourth quarter were consistent with the prior year period total cash costs per ounce of 1 289 in 2018 were higher than 2017 reflecting lower ounces stacked in the period and higher per tonne mining and processing costs resulting from lower throughput mine site aisc per ounce were 1 333 for the quarter and 1 317 for the full year mine site free cash flow was 2 3 million in the quarter and break even for the year the company expects mine site free cash flow to improve in 2019 with the transition to residual leaching fourth quarter 2018 development activities kirazlı çanakkale turkey the company has been granted the three major permits required for the start of construction of kirazlı including the environmental impact assessment forestry permits and gsm business opening and operation permit there are several additional permits required prior to the start of gold production at kirazlı which the company expects to receive in due course as disclosed in december 2018 the next permit required to meet the construction schedule is an operating license which allows for the start of earthworks on the future open pit following receipt of the operating license the company expects to ramp up major construction and earthworks activities putting initial production from kirazlı on track for the second half of 2020 the company spent 20 9 million of kirazlı s initial capital of 152 million in 2018 with road construction complete and the water reservoir and power line 50 and 85 complete respectively as outlined in the 2017 feasibility study kirazlı has a 44 after tax internal rate of return and is expected to produce over 100 000 ounces of gold during its first full year of production at mine site all in sustaining costs of less than 400 per ounce mulatos district sonora mexico cerro pelon and la yaqui grande the environmental impact assessment mia for cerro pelon was submitted during the second quarter of 2018 with approval of the mia and change in land use permits received in the fourth quarter the company has invested 3 4 million on permitting and engineering activities at these projects in the fourth quarter and 6 8 million for the full year on receipt of these permits the company has commenced full scale construction with 25 million budgeted in 2019 for development of the project given its proximity to mulatos infrastructure ore from the cerro pelon open pit will be trucked to the existing heap leach circuit for crushing and processing recently completed work includes construction of a bridge to cross the overland conveyor and a haulage road and crushing circuit which will be located at the mulatos mine cerro pelon is a higher grade high return project and is expected to start contributing low cost production in 2020 driving down combined mulatos district costs in addition 8 million is budgeted in 2019 for permitting and engineering of la yaqui grande the mia for la yaqui grande was submitted late in 2018 with approval expected in the second half of 2019 lynn lake manitoba canada the company released a positive feasibility study on the lynn lake project in december 2017 outlining average annual production of 143 000 ounces over a 10 year mine life 170 000 ounces over its first six years at average mine site all in sustaining costs of 745 per ounce over the past year the company has been evaluating value engineering initiatives to enhance the project s economics including modifications to the overall site layout structures and foundations for the process plant and review of the camp location this work along with 259 000 ounces of newly defined mineral reserves that were not included in the 2017 feasibility study will be incorporated into an updated feasibility study which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2019 development spending in the fourth quarter of 0 6 million related to project optimization activities and 2 4 million for the full year the 2019 capital budget for lynn lake is 11 million including 5 million for development activities and 6 million for exploration development spending will be focused on completing the updated feasibility study and baseline work in support of the environmental impact study eis for the project that will be submitted to satisfy federal and provincial environmental assessment requirements the permitting process is expected to take approximately two years followed by two years of construction fourth quarter 2018 exploration activities island gold ontario canada the 2018 exploration program targeted three main areas within the island main zone which extends over two kilometres along strike the focus was on expanding the down plunge and lateral extensions of the deposit with the objective of adding new near mine mineral resources drill holes in the main and western extension areas were testing high grade east plunging shoots below existing mineral reserves and resources drill holes in the eastern extension were exploring for additional plunging shoots along strike beyond existing mineral reserves and resources the 2018 exploration budget included 45 000 metres m of surface directional exploration drilling 30 000 m of underground exploration drilling 35 000 m of underground delineation drilling and 15 000 m of regional exploration drilling the underground delineation drilling program was focused on converting inferred mineral resources into indicated mineral resources this drilling was conducted from the 340 450 620 730 and 840 levels surface exploration drilling a total of 9 holes were completed in the fourth quarter as part of the directional drilling program which totaled 11 737 m directional drilling targeted areas peripheral to the inferred mineral resource blocks below the 1 000 m level with drill hole spacing ranging from 75 m to 100 m the area that was targeted by the surface directional drill program extends approximately 2 000 m in strike length between the 1 000 m and 1 500 m elevation below surface the surface directional drilling program will continue in 2019 with a focus on defining new inferred mineral resources in the fourth quarter 5 holes totalling 6 039 m were completed as part of the regional exploration drilling program to drill test targets along the goudreau deformation zone to the west of the main island gold mine deposit and at the kremzar gold deposit underground exploration drilling during the fourth quarter of 2018 a total of 2 596 m of underground exploration diamond drilling was completed in 7 holes from the 450 and 840 levels the objective of the underground drilling is to identify new mineral resources close to existing mineral resource or reserve blocks total capitalized exploration expenditures at island gold during the fourth quarter of 2018 were 3 1 million with full year capitalized exploration expenditures of 15 6 million mulatos district sonora mexico the company has a large exploration package covering 28 972 hectares with the majority of past exploration efforts focused around the mulatos mine over the last three years exploration has moved beyond the main mulatos pit area and focused on prospects throughout the wider district after significant exploration success at la yaqui grande over the past few years the focus in 2018 has shifted to other parts of the district including el carricito el halcon and el jaspe in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company invested 1 5 million in exploration activities within the mulatos district of which 0 6 million was capitalized and the remainder expensed this included 4 174 m of diamond drilling focused on el carricito for the full year the company spent 10 5 million of which 2 9 million was capitalized at el carricito the drill program is testing anomalous alteration and structural targets identified by mapping in the first half of 2018 lynn lake manitoba canada the results from the 2018 regional exploration program which included till sampling mapping and prospecting have been integrated with the lynn lake database and are being interpreted in conjunction with the results of the airborne gravity gradiometer agg and magnetic survey with the objective of generating a pipeline of prospective targets across the lynn lake greenstone belt spending in the fourth quarter totaled 1 4 million with full year expenditures to 5 1 million review of fourth quarter financial results during the fourth quarter of 2018 the company sold 131 161 ounces of gold for total revenue of 163 1 million an increase of 1 4 million compared to the prior year period this was primarily driven by the island gold acquisition completed in november 2017 which contributed a record 30 199 ounces or 37 5 million in gold sales in the quarter offset by lower ounces sold at mulatos and a lower realized gold price in the quarter the company s realized gold price of 1 244 per ounce in the fourth quarter was 17 per ounce higher than the london pm fix of 1 227 per ounce for the fourth quarter of 2018 cost of sales were 207 1 million compared to 136 6 million in the prior year period with the increase driven by a non cash inventory impairment charge recorded at el chanate in the quarter mining and processing costs were 96 2 million compared to 90 6 million in the prior year period the increased costs were mainly the result of the addition of island gold which contributed 15 5 million of mining and processing costs in the period as well as higher per unit operating costs at young davidson consolidated total cash costs for the quarter were 770 per ounce compared to 753 in the prior year period the increase was driven by higher total cash costs at young davidson and el chanate partially offset by the addition of lower cost production from island gold in the quarter aisc per ounce increased to 983 from 902 in the prior year period this was primarily driven by higher total cash costs and the timing of sustaining capital spending at young davidson during the quarter the company wrote down 64 0 million of heap leach inventory at el chanate of which 62 5 million was related to mining and processing costs and 1 5 million was related to amortization the company ceased mining activities at el chanate during 2018 and has begun residual leaching the heap leach pad an analysis of the recoverability of the ounces in inventory on the heap leach pad was conducted as of december 31 2018 the company estimated that approximately 51 900 ounces may not be economically recovered resulting in a non cash impairment charge of 64 0 million 49 9 million after tax royalty expense was 4 8 million in the fourth quarter and consistent with the prior year period of 4 9 million as higher royalties at island gold were offset by lower royalties at mulatos amortization of 42 1 million in the quarter was consistent with the prior year period expense of 41 1 million amortization was 321 per ounce compared to 324 per ounce in the prior year period and consistent with guidance the company recognized a loss from operations of 51 3 million in the quarter compared to earnings of 17 1 million in the same period of 2017 as a result of the non cash el chanate inventory impairment charge of 64 0 million and increased operating costs at young davidson the company reported a net loss of 71 5 million in the quarter compared to net loss of 4 7 million in the same period of 2017 net loss for the fourth quarter was impacted by the non cash inventory impairment charge other losses related to disposals and settlement charges and foreign exchange movements related to the weakening of canadian dollar and mexican peso which generated a foreign exchange loss of 1 7 million as well as a foreign exchange loss of 14 1 million recorded within deferred income taxes associated documents this press

business representatives and the diplomatic corps i know we have an amazing field of expertise on africa in the auditorium joining us today we ve been privileged here at the heritage foundation in 2018 to welcome major policy addresses from the highest levels of president trump s administration earlier this year we had the honor of hosting secretary of state mike pompeo and u n ambassador nikki haley today heritage is honored to continue our contributions to the most important national policy discussions we welcome the honorable john bolton assistant to the president for national security affairs ambassador bolton will speak to us on the trump administration s new africa strategy america s global role and foreign policy direction are rapidly expanding in new areas and in new ways africa is a region that before now has not perhaps received the intense attention of the foreign policy community but that is changing political security and economic developments in africa now reverberate widely in america europe and asia how america and the trump administration approach these developments will reverberate equally widely in promoting safety security and prosperity on the african continent thank you all for joining us here today to hear ambassador bolton speak on this important topic and u s strategy going forward we look forward to his remarks and then a discussion afterwards with our executive vice president dr kim holmes i think that it is fitting that dr holmes introduce ambassador bolton today dr holmes is a former assistant secretary of state and one of our leading experts on foreign policy here at heritage in addition to working together over the years dr holmes and ambassador bolton have also been long time friends i would now like to invite dr holmes who has known and worked with the ambassador for many years to offer a warm welcome and introduction kay coles james is president of the heritage foundation thank you very much kay for allowing me to introduce my good friend john bolton and to welcome him to the heritage foundation i d like to welcome all of you as our guests here this morning it s indeed a pleasure to have all of you here and it certainly is an honor to welcome john back to heritage as kay mentioned he is an old friend i remember well hosting john many years ago when he delivered remarks at the heritage foundation on the bush administration s decision to disassociate from the international criminal court it seemed just like yesterday but it actually was quite a while back john and i have indeed been in the trenches for a long time we served together at the state department during the bush administration and frankly i can think of no one i would rather see advising president trump on national security than john bolton there is no better advocate for america he stands up for american interests and american values without apology and without hesitation whether defending american interests at the united nations as he once did when he was permanent representative to the u n or today supporting president trump s agenda now as national security advisor for john bolton as he once said in his book of the same title surrender is not an option john bolton knows the ins and outs of government like no one else i know he is a master not only of details but of the long plan you can see his fingerprints all over decisions recently made by the president and for that we are truly thankful today we welcome him to heritage yet again to discuss the administration s policy and strategy toward africa africa is a vast beautiful and complex continent filled with a rich culture a rich history and an entrepreneurial spirit but it is also experiencing many difficult changes and challenges some of these are old and echoes of the past they ve been around for a very long time but some of them are actually quite new radical islamist groups are destabilizing the region refugee movements in the north and health emergencies in the central regions are contributing to instability there are concerns as well over the influence of external powers such as china and russia on the economic and political life of africans and about the security of the continent now the foreign policy team at the heritage foundation follows these developments closely and so we as well as all of you our distinguished guests here this morning are greatly looking forward to ambassador bolton s address on africa so please now welcome ambassador john bolton the assistant to the president for national security affairs kim r holmes phd is executive vice president of the heritage foundation a new africa strategy i m delighted again to be here at heritage an institution that really has contributed so much to the public policy debate for many decades now in the united states and i m particularly pleased to be here to unveil the trump administration s new africa strategy which the president approved yesterday and which the administration will begin executing immediately this strategy is the result of an intensive interagency process and reflects the core tenets of president trump s foreign policy doctrine importantly the strategy remains true to his central campaign promise to put the interests of the american people first both at home and abroad the white house is proud to finalize this strategy during the second year of president trump s first term about two years earlier than the prior administration s release of its africa strategy we have prioritized developing this document because we understand that lasting stability prosperity independence and security on the african continent are in the national security interest of the united states a three pronged approach under our new approach every decision we make every policy we pursue and every dollar of aid we spend will further u s priorities in the region in particular the strategy addresses three core u s interests on the continent first advancing u s trade and commercial ties with nations across the region to the benefit of both the united states and africa we want our economic partners in the region to thrive prosper and control their own destinies in america s economic dealings we ask only for reciprocity never for subservience second countering the threat from radical islamic terrorism and violent conflict isis al qaeda and their affiliates all operate and recruit on the african continent plotting attacks against american citizens and targets any sound u s strategy toward africa must address this serious threat in a comprehensive way and third we will ensure that u s taxpayer dollars for aid are used efficiently and effectively the united states will no longer provide indiscriminate assistance across the entire continent without focus or prioritization and we will no longer support unproductive unsuccessful and unaccountable u n peacekeeping missions we want something more to show for americans hard earned taxpayer dollars under our new africa strategy we will target u s funding toward key countries and particular strategic objectives all u s aid on the continent will advance u s interests and help african nations move toward self reliance under our new approach every decision we make every policy we pursue and every dollar of aid we spend will further u s priorities in the region economic ties our first priority enhancing u s economic ties with the region is not only essential to improving opportunities for american workers and businesses it is also vital to safeguarding the economic independence of african states and protecting u s national security interests great power competitors namely china and russia are rapidly expanding their financial and political influence across africa they are deliberately and aggressively targeting their investments in the region to gain a competitive advantage over the united states from 2016 2017 china s foreign direct investment toward africa totaled 6 4 billion dollars and over the past several years china has devoted considerable state directed and state supported financing to projects in the region china china uses bribes opaque agreements and the strategic use of debt to hold states in africa captive to beijing s wishes and demands its investment ventures are riddled with corruption and do not meet the same environmental or ethical standards as u s developmental programs such predatory actions are sub components of broader chinese strategic initiatives including one belt one road a plan to develop a series of trade routes leading to and from china with the ultimate goal of advancing chinese global dominance in africa we are already seeing the disturbing effects of china s quest to obtain more political economic and military power the nation of zambia for example is currently in debt to china to the tune of 6 to 10 billion dollars china is now poised to take over zambia s national power and utility company in order to collect on zambia s financial obligations similarly from 2014 to 2016 djibouti s external public debt to gdp ratio ballooned from 50 percent to 85 percent with most of that debt owed to china in 2017 china established a military base in djibouti that is only miles from our u s base camp lemonnier which supports critical u s operations to counter violent terrorist organizations in east africa in may u s officials accused china of using military grade lasers from this base to target and distract u s pilots on 10 different occasions two of our american pilots suffered eye injuries from exposure to laser beams and soon djibouti may hand over control of the doraleh container terminal a strategically located shipping port on the red sea to chinese state owned enterprises should this occur the balance of power in the horn of africa astride major arteries of maritime trade between europe the middle east and south asia would shift in favor of china and our u s military personnel at camp lemonnier could face further challenges in their efforts to protect the american people russia russia for its part is also seeking to increase its influence in the region through corrupt economic dealings across the continent russia advances its political and economic relationships with little regard for the rule of law or accountable and transparent governance it continues to sell arms and energy in exchange for votes at the united nations votes that keep strongmen in power undermine peace and security and run counter to the best interests of the african people russia also continues to extract natural resources from the region for its own benefit in short the predatory practices pursued by china and russia stunt economic growth in africa threaten the financial independence of african nations inhibit opportunities for u s investment interfere with u s military operations and pose a significant threat to u s national security interests countering violent threats equally concerning at this time the lack of economic progress in the region has accompanied the proliferation of radical islamic terrorism and other forms of violent conflict across africa countering these serious threats is the second priority under our new africa strategy in recent years isis al qaeda and other terrorists operating in africa have increased the lethality of their attacks expanded into new areas and repeatedly targeted u s citizens and interests in mali jnim jama at nusrat al islam wal muslimin which describes itself as an al qaeda affiliate is increasing in strength and has killed and wounded scores of peacekeepers partner forces and innocent civilians in addition to kidnapping westerners and threatening u s allies in libya the local isis affiliate has found fertile ground to recruit new terrorists and plot attacks against the united states in south sudan an ongoing civil war has ravaged a young nation displaced millions and led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people the continuing threat from terrorism and other violent conflicts across the region puts american lives at risk and drains vital american resources between 2014 and 2018 the united states provided approximately 3 76 billion dollars in humanitarian aid to south sudan and refugees in neighboring countries this number represents only a small amount of the total aid that the united states devotes to africa the united states will not tolerate this longstanding pattern of aid without effect assistance without accountability and relief without reform in fact in fiscal year 2017 the department of state and usaid provided approximately 8 7 billion dollars in development security and food assistance to africa in fiscal year 2016 we provided approximately 8 3 billion dollars between 1995 and 2006 u s aid to africa was roughly equal to the amount of assistance provided by all other donors combined unfortunately billions upon billions of u s taxpayer dollars have not achieved the desired effects they have not stopped the scourge of terrorism radicalism and violence they have not prevented other powers such as china and russia from taking advantage of african states to increase their own power and influence and they have not led to stable and transparent governance economic viability and increasing development across the region from now on the united states will not tolerate this longstanding pattern of aid without effect assistance without accountability and relief without reform instead we are pursuing a new path one that we hope finally gets results efficient and effective aid americans are a generous people but we insist that our money is put to good use our third priority therefore is ensuring that all u s assistance dollars sent to africa are used efficiently and effectively to advance peace stability independence and prosperity in the region here are some of the specific bold actions we will take under our new strategy to address the three priority areas i have just highlighted prosper africa to expand our economic relationships in the region we are developing a new initiative called prosper africa which will support u s investment across the continent grow africa s middle class and improve the overall business climate in the region in addition we will encourage african leaders to choose high quality transparent inclusive and sustainable foreign investment projects including those from the united states we will leverage our expanded and modernized development tools to support access to financing and provide strong alternatives to external state directed initiatives america s vision for the region is one of independence self reliance and growth not dependency domination and debt america s vision for the region is one of independence self reliance and growth not dependency domination and debt we want african nations to succeed flourish and remain independent in fact and not just in theory trade agreements in the coming years and months we also intend to pursue modern comprehensive trade agreements on the continent that ensure fair and reciprocal exchange between the united states and the nations of africa we will begin these negotiations on a bilateral basis and focus on creating mutually beneficial partnerships our new economic initiatives in africa will help support american jobs and expand market access for u s exports while promoting sustainable growth in african countries strategic partnerships we will focus our economic efforts on african governments that act with us as strategic partners and which are striving toward improved governance and transparent business practices as our partner nations develop economically they will be better prepared to address a range of security threats including terrorism and militant violence under our new strategy we will also take several additional steps to help our african friends fight terrorism and strengthen the rule of law we will assist key african governments in building the capacity of partner forces and security institutions to provide effective and sustainable security and law enforcement services to their citizens our goal is for the nations of the region to take ownership over peace and security in their own neighborhood our goal is for the nations of the region to take ownership over peace and security in their own neighborhood the g5 sahel joint force comprised of mauritania niger chad burkina faso and mali which the united states supports is a great example of the enormous potential for african joint security cooperation the g5 sahel joint force is seeking to build regional capability to combat terrorism transnational organized crime and human trafficking in the sahel as this force gains capacity g5 countries must remain in the driver s seat this initiative cannot be outsourced to the u n for funding and other support we want to see more cooperative regional security organizations like these emerge around the world re evaluate u n peacekeeping as part of our new africa strategy the united states will also re evaluate its support for u n peacekeeping missions we will only back effective and efficient operations and we will seek to streamline reconfigure or terminate missions that are unable to meet their own mandate or facilitate lasting peace our objective is to resolve conflicts not freeze them in perpetuity and we will not provide legitimacy to missions that give large payouts to countries sending poorly equipped soldiers who provide insufficient protection to vulnerable populations on the ground the sexual exploitation and abuse by u n peacekeepers of the very populations that they were sent to protect has been and remains completely unacceptable continued malfeasance without consequences damages the integrity of the entire u n peacekeeping system if we are truly committed to protecting innocent life in conflict zones then we must insist on accountable robust and effective peacekeeping operations in april the united states did just that regarding the decades old u n peacekeeping mission in western sahara we demanded a six month rather than annual renewal period for the mission and we insisted on a stronger more effective mandate tied to substantive political progress because of our actions the parties to the conflict and key neighboring countries agreed to meet for the first time since 2012 last week the u n envoy hosted these talks in geneva and the participants agreed to hold additional talks early next year regional stakeholders moving forward we will also ensure that bilateral u s security assistance targets nations that act as responsible regional stakeholders and nations where state failure or weakness would pose a direct threat to the united states and our citizens we want to use american dollars in the most efficient way to protect the interests of the american people accordingly we will make certain that all aid to the region whether for security humanitarian or development needs advances these u s interests assistance requirements countries that receive u s assistance must invest in health and education encourage accountable and transparent governance support fiscal transparency and promote the rule of law the administration will not allow hard earned taxpayer dollars to fund corrupt autocrats who use the money to fill their coffers at the expense of their people or commit gross human rights abuses for example the united states is now reviewing its assistance to south sudan to ensure that our aid does not prolong the conflict or facilitate predatory behavior we will not provide loans or more american resources to a south sudanese government led by the same morally bankrupt leaders who perpetuate the horrific violence and immense human suffering in south sudan the administration will not allow hard earned taxpayer dollars to fund corrupt autocrats who use the money to fill their coffers at the expense of their people or commit gross human rights abuses the administration is also developing a new foreign assistance strategy to improve the effectiveness of american foreign aid worldwide american foreign assistance was originally designed to counter the soviet union during the cold war and most recently to fight terrorism after 9 11 today we need to make adjustments to address the pressing challenge of great power competition and to correct past mistakes in structuring our funding in developing our strategy we are revisiting the foundational principles of the marshall plan the marshall plan furthered american interests bypassed the united nations and targeted key sectors of foreign economies rather than dissipating aid across hundreds of programs our new foreign assistance strategy will ensure that all u s foreign aid in every corner of the globe advances u s interests our goal is to move recipient states toward self reliance and prevent long term dependency structural reforms will likely be critical including practicing fiscal responsibility promoting fair and reciprocal trade deregulating economies and supporting the private sector we should emphasize bilateral mechanisms to maintain maximum american control over every american dollar spent less needy recipients should graduate from foreign assistance and assistance should decline to countries and organizations making poor policy choices maximum impact in addition we should target resources toward areas where we have the most impact to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars countries that repeatedly vote against the united states in international forums or take action counter to u s interests should not receive generous american foreign aid countries that repeatedly vote against the united states in international forums or take action counter to u s interests should not receive generous american foreign aid the united states will respect the independence of other nations in providing humanitarian security and development assistance we are not among those powers that pursue dollars for dependency however we draw the line at funding causes that harm our interests and our citizens conclusion around the world the united states seeks partners who are self reliant independent and strong nations that respect the interests of their people the rights of their neighbors and the principle of fairness and reciprocity in all agreements under our new africa strategy we will expand economic ties on the basis of mutual respect we will help african nations take control of their own economic destinies and their own security needs and we will ensure that all u s foreign assistance in the region gets results for the american people i am honored to have had the opportunity to highlight the details of our plans here at heritage today and i look forward to taking your questions thank you very much the honorable john r bolton is the u s national security advisor questions answers dr holmes well thank you very much for that john when we first heard that you were actually working on a larger africa strategy we were very pleased to hear that because we ve long argued here that africa does not get the attention it needs or when it does get the attention from the administration the result is often pursuing policies that not only do not improve things but actually in some cases make them worse and so tackling africa from the point of view of the principles that you outlined was something we really welcome and makes us doubly happy that you decided to come here and share the president s new strategy at the heritage foundation while we are here if there are any points you wish to elaborate on or extrapolate on this is your time so you can jump in at any moment to get things started i thought i would ask you to comment a little bit more on the strategic competition you mentioned regarding china and russia particularly the approach of china is multifaceted it s cutting across the entire range of national and international security and economic policy trade foreign aid and the like and so as you rightly pointed out we need a broad holistic response to that if you could say a little bit more about all the tools you have at your disposal for u s policy but if you also could at some point talk about what is the impact on u s military activities military presence and military security even in terms of the assistance that we provide to some of the countries either for military or counter terrorism purposes ambassador bolton one of the reasons that i ve been interested in africa for some time is my first real job in the government was at the u s agency for international development in the reagan administration and i traveled among other places to zimbabwe just a few years after the real independence of zimbabwe the end of white rule and the beginning of self government there and it was a fascinating time it didn t work out so well for a lot of reasons hopefully we re in a new era now but the continuation of these kinds of governance problems was something that always drew my attention as i was mentioning to you and kay a little bit earlier being at the u n in new york and talking to african ambassadors about their vision for their own countries and for africa was something that also i found quite fascinating but within the u s government it is fair to say whether it s republican or democratic administrations it s often been difficult to get people to focus on it there are always competing priorities but now i think precisely because of the very well thought out very comprehensive intervention of china in the continent of africa and other places around the world too with a program that is very systematically designed to tilt whole regions of the world and particularly mineral resource rich areas in china s direction that this is a very important point for the united states and the west as a whole to wake up to we need to foster as i said a few moments ago independence for african countries the united states although our adversaries for decades called us an imperial power we re probably the least imperial great power in the history of the world our interest doesn t match any prior power throughout history of comparable size and influence but that s not the view of some of the great powers we are competing with in the world today so we really have an opportunity here i hope for a debate and discussion in the united states about shaping relations with africa to the mutual advantage of the african countries on the one hand and the united states on the other it s a very different view than i think some of our competitors hold so whether it s in the economic field prosper africa is not an aid program the idea is based on trade and investment in the security field because of the threats that we see really across the african continent and in the political space as well there are some real opportunities here now resources from the u s government are constrained there s no doubt about it we re certainly looking for all the opportunities we can i think if you re going to have a comprehensive strategy and i mentioned our foreign aid review which is very near completion that implies changes in allocations and directions otherwise you re just pursuing the path you pursued the year before endlessly that doesn t amount to a strategy that just amounts to bureaucracy repeating itself but hopefully with the strategy that the president has just approved we can have that kind of conversation to give africa the priority in american strategic thinking that i think the administration believes it deserves dr holmes you ve mentioned the review of the foreign assistance program that is currently happening reforming the foreign aid program is something that we here at heritage have been looking at for decades we ve been talking about the importance of having conditionality applied to the aid focusing more on developing civil society and free markets and economic freedom rather than government to government assistance which ends up propping up corrupt regimes very often could you give us a forecast of what is happening with that review but in particular from our interest here is there any thought about what will change in terms of the purpose and mission and structure of aid as the main administrator of these programs ambassador bolton right well i wish i could say that the foreign aid review was complete and that i could describe it and when it is i d be happy to come back and do it dr holmes we could do that too ambassador bolton we re close and i would expect within a very short period of time we will bring it to a conclusion i think again speaking as an aid alumnus what we see is that for years things have just proceeded really without this kind of comprehensive review it s long overdue there s a long history to u s foreign assistance programs the first was a private effort herbert hoover s famous committee for relief in belgium during world war i where really with no assistance from the u s government at all he developed an enormous program for feeding civilian populations in war stricken europe but we ve got to have more effective delivery mechanisms i think we re going to look very hard as i mentioned in the speech at what is the best way to provide this assistance i d reveal my biases again if i said i was an aid alumnus i understand bilateral programs have also been at the u n i have my views on that as well as you know but look this is a complex process if it were easy to do it d be done already but there are a lot of very bright prospects here and we re going to be talking to some of the other donor nations as well as we conclude our review and see if they might not be up for looking at their programs too dr holmes you mentioned also in the context of the new africa that you re taking a strong and hard and close look at u n peacekeeping operations in africa and you mentioned that the principle of trying to actually bring peace and end the operations rather than freezing the conflict which very often happens with u n peacekeeping operations is a goal and the new strategy once again this is a very laudable goal as far as we at heritage are concerned beyond the mission of south sudan are there any other peacekeeping operations that you are looking at for example monusco in the democratic republic of congo which is i think the second largest peacekeeping operation in africa there are others as well this is really where most of the u n peacekeeping operation work is done in africa can you say a bit more about that ambassador bolton right well clearly what has happened in u n peacekeeping operations all around the world is that in an effort to bring an ongoing conflict to an end a truce of some kind is arranged and a peacekeeping force is inserted increasingly in recent years with a political component to it but unfortunately all too often at the united nations establishing the peacekeeping force and deploying it is the end of creative thinking and the mandate is renewed almost automatically the secretary general special representative comes in every year gives a report the security council rolls the mandate over and not very much happens i think there needs to be a lot more focused on resolving the underlying conflict and therefore having success in the peacekeeping mission success is not simply continuing the mission ad infinitum and i picked the western sahara as my favorite example because when i had the job that we both once held as assistant secretary for international organizations at the state department in 1991 i participated in writing the mandate of minurso when it was created 27 years ago and i worked with jim baker when he was kofi annan s personal envoy in 1997 to try and resolve the western sahara where the entire effort had broken down and he tried it again in 2000 and 2001 and when i got to the u n in 2006 2005 or 2006 again we tried to fix all we want to do is hold a referendum for 70 000 voters it s 27 years later the status of the territory is still unresolved the new u n envoy i think has some very creative ideas but honestly ladies and gentlemen 27 years of deployment of this u n peacekeeping force twenty seven years and it s still there how can you justify that so i think over the years i ve gotten to know the sahrawi people i have enormous respect for them i have enormous respect for the government and people in morocco and algeria is there not a way to resolve this because the resources the time and attention that we re devoting to the peacekeeping forces could much more productively be used in the development and economic betterment of the people of the region that s why this is important if you resolve conflicts you re freeing resources economic and political for other purposes that s what our objective should be dr holmes you re right about in many ways the way that the mandates are put together for the peacekeeping operations they re political compromises with the groups in the region and also the countries on the security council and the compromises almost always end up either freezing the situation or not advancing it when i was assistant secretary i visited congo and flew all around in one case there was a village that had been re occupied by some of the militia who drove out mostly the women and children into the side region of the village u n agencies came in and took care of those children but they would do nothing about the problem they told me that this was because of the way the mandate was written which is basically freezing the conflict so this is a very real problem that is built into the way they approach peacekeeping operations ambassador bolton let me just say on that point i m not blaming the u n secretary here i m blaming the security council the security council sets the peacekeeping forces up security councils should guide the special representatives the security council should press to get the conflict resolved and it s not enough just to roll a peacekeeping mandate over they need to be much more involved politically in getting the parties to work out their differences dr holmes you mentioned the problem of terrorism in africa it is very significant in some areas it s even growing could you say a bit more about what the united states expects of african countries themselves and not only cooperating with the united states but even taking activities and responsibilities on themselves in combating terrorism ambassador bolton well there certainly have been very successful efforts i think i mentioned the g5 sahel joint force there are others that we can envision others we would support we re in active conversation in new york and a number of capitals on that score look it s foundational in the u n charter that regional organizations should have much more of a role than they ve historically had i think africa is a very important place to try and make that principal work obviously there are countries in africa that have benefited from successful u n peacekeeping operations namibia is a good example mozambique but i think now it s time for african governments to take the lead themselves and do more of that we d love to encourage and support that if the circumstances are right dr holmes the heritage foundation is a civil society organization if you will and there are many people in this audience from civil society groups who operate and work either in africa or work on the subject of africa i m sure that many of them are interested in what they could do or should be doing differently in terms of civil society support for helping the african people that would be complementary to what you re trying to do with your new africa strategy ambassador bolton well i think the most important thing is to look at the geopolitical reality that we re facing we ve already seen some countries i mentioned a couple of concerns in africa but other countries in asia some in latin america where this what we call debt for diplomacy debt diplomacy strategy is being pursued very successfully it s very tempting to get into financial arrangements that seem attractive in the near term but that then get more and more difficult to get out of so i think because the state directed nature of that kind of approach fundamentally isn t really reconcilable with independent civil society to begin with i think nongovernmental organizations and others should be aware of that and should be advising their partners in africa of the risks involved when these kinds of proposals are made because not only will it squeeze the independence of african countries it will squeeze the space available for civil society inevitably dr holmes well we ve been hearing for many years the mantra toward africa trade not aid and you mentioned both trade and aid in your remarks there are many u s companies that probably would like to invest more in africa they re not sure of the trade environment the legal environment most important they re not sure of the security and political environment if we wish to try to engage africa more not only at a civil society level but in economic and financial levels in order to counter what china is doing what can we be saying to american corporations or investors in addition to what you mentioned a minute ago about civil society groups that you would be working on to try to increase a better more friendly environment for u s investment in africa ambassador bolton well i think the policy environment is obviously the most important and i think that really is fundamentally within the control of the african countries themselves the more open they are the competitive foreign investment not tied to one country or one particular program the more likely foreign investors are to come in in the united states we ve certainly added to our capacity to help american investors through major improvements i think in opic the overseas private investment corporation with new authorities with the millennium challenge corporation there are lots of possibilities here that didn t exist when i was with aid and i think those are all things from an american business point of view that really ought to point them in the direction of places where their supply chain can be safer and less susceptible to political manipulation as it is in many countries where we ve invested dr holmes both you and i in the discussion here have made reference a couple of times to the different approach that you re trying to take with africa and how it differs from past approaches not to put you on the spot but maybe i can what do you think in the past has been the central conceptual mistake that administrations have made in the past or americans make when they look toward africa i know there s a lot of different aspects to the policies that you re talking about but if you raise it to the strategic level what have we done wrong in the past when we have thought about africa ambassador bolton well i think too many administrations look it s a bipartisan problem have looked at africa and said they wouldn t necessarily put it this way but they d say it s not strategically important to the united states i can remember an assistant secretary of african affairs in one administration in which i served i ll leave that vague so i don t embarrass him once told me the story about how he had had a consultation with his japanese opposite number the assistant secretary equivalent there for africa and they had both quickly agreed that in the list of regional bureaus and the foreign ministry in japan and the state department in washington africa was the lowest ranking priority of all the regional bureaus and i think if you start with that proposition the conclusion s pretty obvious i just think the proposition is wrong africa is incredibly important to the united states if we didn t understand it before the competition posed by china and russia among others should highlight it for us which is why i do think this is a potential turning point in american understanding of what s at stake for us not just for africa but for the united states in african affairs so that as we address this i think there should be a new openness on both sides to understanding what s at risk here and why it s to our advantage to update our understanding of what the priority is for the united states dr holmes well one of the main themes of your speech and the president makes this point time and time again is that american foreign policy should serve the interests of the american people and our values and the interesting thing that at least struck me about the way that you were laying out the strategy is that yes it suits our interests it suits our values but it s good for africans too as a matter of fact it s just more effective in actually combating the problems that the africans themselves face whether it s terrorism economic development or a lack of freedom this has been the formula in my opinion of american genius of our foreign policy over the last decades it s sort of a re centering in the way i see it of american foreign policy and the traditional way that we have looked at our interests in the past can you say about how the in your conversations with the president and his approach to american interests he has said elsewhere he s actually talked with our european allies in terms of burden sharing but this is not really the context that you re putting this in can you say a bit more about how the president s own vision of his new foreign policy fits into what you re doing ambassador bolton right well i m sure people in this room probably know the famous alibi lines i guess that the people use it s become sort of a joke when somebody says the check s in the mail you know the check s not in the mail when somebody says i m from the government and i m here to help that s an instant warning that you better put your hand on your wallet i think the conceptual mistake that has been made before is that talking about the u s relationship with africa is talking about how we re going to help africa i think the president s transactional history of making deals that are mutually beneficial because you don t make many successful investments unless the people on the other side of the transaction get something out of it too is something that should encourage african governments and those that want to see a higher level of relations between the united states and africa to see what s possible because with a little straight talking among friends about what s beneficial on both sides you re much more likely to get a successful outcome than pretending that it s a one sided relationship
hong kong a slowing global economy and increasing strain on businesses from a year long sino us trade war are tilting central banks from japan to australia towards monetary easing in a remarkable 180 degree turn late last year the debate in japan was focussed on the demerits of printing money and the reserve bank of australia rba was adamant the next likely move in rates will be up an emerging market currency selloff was seen forcing externally vulnerable economies such as india indonesia and the philippines to keep tightening their policy rates but even they are now subject to rate cut bets a softer dollar and lower oil prices played an important role in the turnaround but crucially for asia regional growth engine china is having a worse than expected start to the year and is exporting disinflation to the rest of the region the federal reserve last month adopted a more cautious approach in a shift that signalled its tightening cycle might be at an end what s obviously happening is that central banks are rethinking monetary policy said piyush gupta ceo of dbs group holdings in singapore with the exception of philippines which is also witnessing rapid disinflation all major asian economies are now facing inflation rates at the lower end or even below their central banks target price growth is sub 1 per cent in malaysia singapore south korea taiwan and thailand underlying price pressures are remarkably soft and broadly falling frederic neumann co head of asian economics research at hsbc said the case for further monetary easing may thus become more pressing even if in itself this may not be enough to push up growth materially on tuesday bank of japan governor haruhiko kuroda said the central bank was ready to boost stimulus if sharp yen rises hurt the economy and its price goal also in tokyo on the same day bangko sentral ng pilipinas bsp deputy governor diwa guinigundo said the central bank which hiked five times last year will act swiftly if liquidity conditions are not sufficient to maintain economic momentum earlier this month the rba shifted to a neutral stance from its previous tightening bias but an increasing number of economists polled by reuters are predicting a cut india s central bank unexpectedly lowered interest rates in february and analysts are tipping another cut of the three major economies running current account deficits indonesia is the only one where expectations for a policy reversal after six hikes last year are extremely low as the central bank is more focused on exchange rate stability bsp is more likely to take a surprise earlier turn in its monetary policy bias than bi given the central bank s growth bias and rapidly slowing growth momentum said juliana lee asia chief economist at deutsche bank at this stage economists don t see chances of more than one cut in any asian economy but much will depend on how china performs whether its trade dispute with the united states is resolved and how successful beijing s stimulus efforts are in january the people s bank of china pboc slashed the reserve requirement ratio rrr by 100 basis points and analysts expect another 150 bps of cuts by year end on top of other fiscal stimulus measures expected in march some economists do expect a cut in benchmark interest rates but the consensus is that such a move would only come as a last resort given that it could hurt the yuan and reignite debt risks only if internal and external environments change drastically will cutting benchmark saving and lending rates become much more likely icbc analysts said in a note
venezuela s economic fortunes have been tethered to the price of oil for most of the country s modern history a dependency that only worsened after a charismatic former paratrooper named hugo chavez took office in 1999 chavez who came to power in the wake of an oil crash that decimated venezuela s traditional parties ramped up political patronage to a degree the country had never seen when crude prices suddenly began to soar again the windfall temporarily masked the economic devastation caused by his version of socialism a toxic mix of expropriations subsidies and currency and price controls

has left the country mired in poverty and hyperinflation and led to the near collapse of its all important oil industry the bad news things can still get worse if maduro manages to remain in power with the support of the military the country will likely continue its descent into a pariah state a tropical version of syria under bashar al assad on the other hand if guaido and his foreign allies manage to force maduro from office the task of rebuilding the broken nation will be monumental the succeeding government would need foreign financing to revamp the oil industry it would also need to restore the rule of law for businesses to feel comfortable investing in the reeling economy the brain drain of educated professionals would need to go into reverse to staff everything from hospitals to oil rigs in short taking venezuela back to the relative prosperity it enjoyed for much of the 20th century will be no easy task

what s the fuss with macro i am certainly not an advocate of market timing and i agree with the notion that trying to profit from timing market peaks and bottoms is a fool s errand as buffett says macro is important but unknowable so focus on the knowable i e focus on company fundamentals for the businesses you own however that said adding a macro overlay to your investing playbook is something completely different and something that i am certainly guilty of what exactly do i mean by having a macro overlay to my strategy the answer is that i like to be broadly cognizant of macro factors including but not limited to economic growth both regional and global where we are in the business cycle credit cycles short term and long term outlook for inflation or lack thereof interest rates and their likely direction in the near term impact of trends in major currencies monetary policy in g4 economies central bank interventions quantitative easing or currency management and fiscal policy to name a few ignore at your own peril now while some of the above factors may not have a meaningful impact on the underlying business prospects of your portfolio holdings especially in the short term collectively macro factors including those mentioned above will undoubtedly impact corporate earnings asset prices and market multiples especially in the longer term so while you can never exactly time a crash or a trough in the markets one can certainly prepare by asking oneself the following questions where in the cycle is the underlying economy contrary to popular belief economies don t run in a linear way the sine wave pattern is what one needs to keep in mind what is the outlook for inflation since this is one of the primary determinants of monetary policy are interest rates likely headed higher or lower based on the outlook for things like the economy job growth and inflation is the central bank likely to tighten liquidity or create it by unconventional means like the fed s series of qe programs following the great financial crisis of 2008 the above is by no means an exhaustive list but you get the picture my portfolio management strategy inspired by warren buffett s teachings i my stock selection criteria revolves around discovering world class businesses that by virtue of their superior business model brand excellence and capable management possess a demonstrable and durable competitive position allowing them to compound earnings and cash flow per share at an extraordinary rate today and far into the future also commonly known as compounders the final and perhaps the most important piece of the puzzle is of course price companies that fulfill the above criteria are a rare breed and are unsurprisingly seldom priced cheap one has to be ready to take advantage of those rare occasions when mr market gives us the opportunity to snap up shares in such companies at an attractive valuation please bear in mind that these magical companies are not easy to find nor cheap to buy and the strategy requires a predisposition on behalf of the investor to seek long term alpha as opposed to short term speculative returns as buffett says time is the friend of the wonderful company the enemy of the mediocre you can read some of my earlier articles which articulate at length the specific criteria i use for stock selection price price price that said even a world class company can prove to be losing investment if one pays too expensive a price for it as a classic example please see the chart below for coca cola ko between 2000 when the stock traded at 32 at an ev to fcf multiple of 60x and by early 2006 the stock was at 20 and traded at less than 18x on an ev to fcf basis a loss of 40 this is for a world class company such as ko this exemplifies why value investors including myself don t like paying high multiples data by ycharts another equally important aspect of portfolio management is to have an objective decision making process with regards to selling a position when it becomes too expensive so allow me to share with you two examples of stocks that i have very recently decided to sell not because the prospects of the underlying business have changed or deteriorated but because they have simply become too expensive or in other words trade at a premium to my estimate of their intrinsic value remember that my macro overlay helps me in that decision since equity valuations are generally high and macro risk remains elevated as i explain below but for now back to the sell decision examples mastercard first up ma one of my all time favorite businesses and one that i have written about here on seeking alpha this is a stock that i bought for 50 at an ev to fcf multiple of 18x back in 2013 as you can see it currently trades at 220 which is 4 4x my cost price but the multiple has exploded from sub 20x to almost 40x ev fcf data by ycharts verisign another example is vrsn also a world class business and a prized stock that i proudly held for a long time similar story to ma i bought back in early 2013 for 40 at an unbelievably cheap valuation of under 10x ev to fcf fast forward to today it trades at an all time high of 175 4 4x my cost price but the valuation has sky rocketed from less than 10x to 33x ev to fcf again i sold a week or so ago for the same reasons i mentioned above for ma data by ycharts my mantra remember time not timing is the key to successful long term investing the above two charts more than exemplify that absolute priceless bit of advice from buffett himself so what exactly is a macro overlay in other words what am i proposing it is that in my opinion not to incorporate macro factors into the matrix of how one positions the portfolio is risky at best and reckless at worst by positioning i mean things like asset allocation fixed income equities real estate commodities and chaos hedges like precious metals etc taking profits or adding to new positions increasing or decreasing allocation to cash deciding on net exposure being net long or net short depending upon whether my outlook is bearish or bullish one can deploy instruments like short positions in equities indices buying puts on stocks indices go long volatility etc if one is trending bearish for example i combine that with the basic criteria of whether quality businesses the type of stocks that i like to own are available to buy at valuations that i would be happy to pay this broadly means paying less than 15x ev to fcf for buy decisions and more than 30x ev to fcf for sell decisions generally speaking current macro landscape as i see it so the logical next step is to list some of the macro conditions that currently exist or remain on the horizon the below list is in no particular order except for the top few the prospect of quantitative tightening qt by the federal reserve in other words the unwinding of their balance sheet or the reversal of quantitative easing currently the fed has left the market guessing as to what the next move is going to be the prospect of the federal reserve continuing to raise interest rates growth in the world s largest economy that of the us is now showing signs of a slowdown the world s second largest economy namely china slowing in a more pronounced manner than is manifest today the prospect of a trade war between the united states and china getting more aggressive the explosion of household debt levels in the us including student loans auto loans in particular sub prime auto loans credit card debt the record levels highest in history of corporate debt in the us for the record i consider this factor as the most likely culprit that will trigger the next crisis in the us that could potentially spill over globally the issue at the core is a record amount of corporate debt issued since 2008 the record amount of low quality debt consider this bbb rated debt the lowest notch in the investment grade or ig universe now constitutes more than 50 of the ig universe the record amount of debt coming due for refinancing in the next 24 months record levels of corporate stock buybacks which have played a huge role in keeping market multiples high will decrease as corporate balance sheets are forced to de lever and or the prospects of legislation against buybacks gain traction algorithmic trading and passive instruments like index funds and etfs which now according to some estimates constitute 80 of daily trading volumes can cause outsized stock moves and cause a cascading effect on stock declines in times of market stress the european central bank has also wrapped up its bond buying program ecb s version of qe since last summer this clearly adds to the global liquidity being sucked from the system and as a result may help dampen asset prices around the globe i believe the ecb is quite likely to rethink and or reverse this policy given the ongoing rapid deterioration of the eurozone economy the us economy is still the healthiest in the developed world and amongst the largest economies of the world moreover the usd is undoubtedly still the unchallenged reserve currency of the world which has resulted in usd strength overlay that with the fact that a record amount of usd denominated debt in the emerging world including china is coming due for refinancing in the next 12 to 24 months this may cause an unexpected shortage of us dollars and may result in emerging market currency debt and stock market stress the eurozone economy continues its rapid slowdown with italy already in recession and germany very close to entering one france and spain follow closely behind the situation with european banks be it spanish italian or the german kind worsening with the economies slowing populism on the rise and unemployment increasing see below a chart for price performance of german bank stocks from the late eighties to today based on data from bloomberg see below the chart for deutsche bank db stock from 2007 to date data and chart from yahoo finance systemic risk anyone too big to fail the seemingly never ending brexit conundrum and its impact on the uk economy s p 500 constituents margins potentially having peaked in 2018 and there are increasing prospects of a looming earnings recession with earnings growth expectations rapidly being revised downwards chart below from jesse felder the australian housing bubble is deflating as we speak this could have huge ramifications for the seemingly invincible australian economy as well as the australian banking system and finally what i consider to be the gorilla in the room is the aging and retirement profile of the baby boomer generation in the us there are an estimated 75 million baby boomers with an average age of 65 in other words anywhere between 10 000 and 15 000 baby boomers enter retirement every single day this cohort also happens to be the one with the largest exposure to the us equity markets with volatility increasing the economy late in the cycle and the bull market at ten years old is now tired and expensive combined with all the above factors the slightest hint of a looming recession in the us probability of which seems to grow with recent economic data could result in a major drawdown in the asset markets in particular the equity markets and see a life changing reversal of fortunes for an average baby boomer on the verge of retirement raoul pal founder of real vision the author of global macro investor and certainly one of the best macro thinkers of this generation has written and talked about this extensively he has even produced documentaries about the topic only to make his concerns public and to warn as many people as possible before millions potentially lose the prospect of a respectable retirement i would urge everyone to watch this short documentary titled the coming retirement crisis produced by raoul pal on behalf of real vision television does the fed care about asset prices if i were to focus on just one of the above factors i have listed quantitative tightening or the unwinding of the fed s balance sheet would perhaps be the one i d watch most closely there is not an iota of doubt in my mind that stability in markets and asset prices generally is a priority for the fed as it is for other major central banks even though they are not likely to admit as such in a million years here is how the fed chairman jerome powell responded to a question regarding the fed s balance sheet in his post fomc press conference on december 19 heather long hi heather long from the washington post today the fed lowered its expectations for interest rate increases given that i m wondering if the fed has had any discussion of altering the course of balance sheet normalization and if you could give us any insight on what might lead the fomc to alter that balance sheet normalization in 2019 chairman powell sure if you go back some years i think we people who were working at the fed in 2013 and 14 took away the lesson that the markets could be very sensitive to news about the size of the balance sheet the pace of asset purchases the pace of runoff and things like that so we thought carefully about this on how to normalize policy and came to the view that we would effectively have the balance sheet runoff on automatic pilot and use monetary policy rate policy to adjust to incoming data and i think that has been a good decision i think that the runoff of the balance sheet has been smooth and has served its purpose and i don t see us changing that and i do think that we will continue to use monetary policy which is to say rate policy as the active tool of monetary policy that day the s p 500 closed down 40 points or 1 6 you can see the price action on the s p 500 from 1 december 2018 to date in the chart below the equity volatility index jumped from 16 on december 3rd to 36 by christmas eve data by ycharts as seen in this report titled us fed s powell seeks to reassure markets the tone at the us central bank had completely changed by the first week of january 2019 there is no pre set path for policy and particularly with the muted inflation themes coming in we will be patient as we see how the economy evolves mr powell said and the fed is prepared to adjust policy quickly and flexibly to support the economy he added we re listening carefully to the message that markets are sending and we ll be taking those downside risks into account as we make policy going forward he said and by the 30th of january when the first post fomc press conference of 2019 was held the fed pivot was formally announced to the world in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures the committee will be patient as it determines the target range for the federal funds rate in addition the case for raising rates has weakened somewhat let me now turn to balance sheet normalization the normalization of the size of the portfolio will be completed sooner and with a larger balance sheet than in previous estimates the committee is now evaluating the appropriate timing for the end of balance sheet runoff this decision will likely be part of a plan for gradually reaching our ultimate balance sheet goals while avoiding unnecessary market disruption while the federal funds rate would remain our active tool of policy in a wide range of scenarios we recognize that the economy could again present conditions in which federal funds rate policy is not sufficient in those cases the fomc would be prepared to use its full range of tools including balance sheet policy so where do i stand today given the plethora of macro headwinds as i see them it is my humble opinion that the risks are skewed to the downside or at the very least there is limited upside relative to a significantly higher downside risk in asset markets particularly equity markets today i therefore have an unusually high cash balance in my portfolio although i have not gone decidedly bearish in terms of my short exposure i e shorting stocks indices or buying puts yet i have my shopping list ready which i monitor and update continuously scanning for opportunities to buy things at what i would deem attractive prices should the market provide that fortunate window conclusion in conclusion blending a thorough value investing methodology and philosophy with a macro overlay helps me in deciding my intermediate term investing playbook make asset allocation decisions decide on net exposure and cash percentage levels as well as selecting appropriate instruments for when i have a bearish outlook based on a combination of market valuation and the macro environment i hope readers come to a similar conclusion disclosure i wrote this article myself it was originally published on my blog thank you

financial measures section for further details fourth quarter results consolidated sales for the fourth quarter were 419 5 million a 1 1 increase compared to the same quarter last year driven by organic sales of 2 3 generated mainly by the finishmaster us segment and the parts alliance uk segment the organic growth was partially offset by the foreign exchange rate conversion for the canadian automotive group and the parts alliance uk segments and by timing in the canadian automotive group segment related to many installers and jobbers being closed two additional days during the holiday season the corporation generated ebitda and ebitda margin of 12 8 million and 3 0 respectively compared to 25 9 million and 6 2 in 2017 and were impacted by special items of 8 6 million including

million compared to 8 7 million and 11 6 million in 2017 adjusted earnings decreased by 6 2 million compared to the same quarter last year due to the lower adjusted ebitda mentioned above additional finance costs as well as higher depreciation and amortization related to investments in capital segmented fourth quarter results the finishmaster us segment is reporting organic growth for a third consecutive quarter with sales of 203 4 million up 2 3 from the same quarter in 2017 this performance is attributable to the efforts of the sales team in driving growth by developing business volume and onboarding new accounts ebitda was 11 7 million compared to 19 6 million for the comparable quarter of 2017 excluding special items for restructuring and other charges adjusted ebitda was 13 4 million compared to 19 6 million for the same quarter last year the adjusted ebitda margin decrease of 330 basis points is the result of pricing pressure and evolving customer mix impacting the gross margin during the quarter this element was partially compensated by savings arising from the 25 20 plan including the integration of one company owned store during the current quarter the alignment of employee benefits to its evolving cost to serve model and an improved absorption of fixed costs resulting from organic growth initiatives sales for the canadian automotive group segment were 122 5 million compared to 123 0 million in 2017 a decrease of 0 5 reflecting the impact of a weaker canadian dollar and negative organic growth of 0 5 that were compensated by sales from recent acquisitions and a higher number of billing days ebitda for this segment was 5 9 million compared to 6 3 million for the same quarter last year excluding special items for restructuring and other charges of 3 3 million adjusted ebitda was 9 3 million compared to 6 3 million for the same quarter last year the adjusted ebitda margin increase of 250 basis points compared to the same quarter in 2017 is mainly attributable to additional vendor rebates for annual performance this element was partially offset by foreign exchange losses due to the weaker canadian dollar and the ongoing integration efforts to optimize company owned stores including the 25 20 plan store rebranding store processes and implementation of a new point of sale pos system the parts alliance uk segment recorded sales of 93 6 million an increase of 0 6 compared to the same quarter last year and reported organic growth of 2 8 the organic growth was driven by the recent opening of company owned stores expanding our footprint in the uk and providing a superior service platform for national accounts ebitda for this segment was 2 4 million compared to 3 7 million for the same quarter last year excluding special items for restructuring and other charges adjusted ebitda was 3 6 million compared to 3 7 million last year the adjusted ebitda margin decreased slightly by 20 basis points compared to the same quarter in 2017 and is mainly attributable to additional employee benefits in relation to acquisitions and to the opening of company owned stores twelve month period results consolidated sales for the twelve month period were 1 752 0 million a 21 0 increase compared to the same period last year driven by sales generated from business acquisitions of 287 0 million or 19 8 mainly from the parts alliance uk

decreased by 130 basis points primarily due to pricing pressure and evolving customer mix impacting the gross margin in the finishmaster us segment as well as the integration efforts undertaken to optimize the network of company owned stores in the canadian automotive group segment these impacts were partially compensated for by savings resulting from the 25 20 plan and improved cost absorption at the parts alliance uk segment benefiting from a full twelve month period of operations net earnings and adjusted earnings were respectively 36 5 million and 51 5 million compared to 44 6 million and 55 1 million last year adjusted earnings decreased by 6 6 compared to the same period last year and resulted mainly from additional financial costs associated with a higher average level of debt and by additional depreciation and amortization mostly related to business acquisitions and investments in capital these elements were partially offset by lower income tax mainly related to the lower statutory rates in the us segmented twelve month period results the finishmaster us segment recorded sales of 830 0 million up 1 9 from the same period in 2017 supported by organic growth of 11 2 million or 1 4 as well as business acquisitions representing a growth of 7 3 million or 0 9 the organic growth is resulting from sales initiatives customer investments and the opening of two company owned stores ebitda for this segment was 74 3 million compared to 91 3 million in 2017 excluding special items adjusted ebitda was 76 0 million compared to 91 3 million the adjusted ebitda margin decrease of 200 basis points is the result of pricing pressure and evolving customer mix impacting the gross margin partially offset by headcount reductions from 25 20 initiatives during the year 2018 five company owned stores were integrated as part of this plan sales for the canadian automotive group segment were 503 8 million compared to 484 9 million in 2017 an increase of 3 9 resulting from business acquisitions a higher number of billing days and organic growth organic growth of 0 5 for the period is principally a result of various initiatives to drive growth amidst softer market conditions ebitda for this segment was 28 6 million compared to 31 2 million in 2017 excluding special items adjusted ebitda was 32 0 million compared to 31 2 million adjusted ebitda margin decreased slightly by 10 basis points as a result of integration efforts undertaken to optimize and integrate our growing network of company owned stores foreign exchange losses due to the weaker canadian dollar as well as internalization of servers which was a favourable one time cost saving in 2017 these elements were partially offset by higher volume rebates and reduction in performance based compensation during the year six company owned stores were integrated and one was sold as part of the 25 20 plan the parts alliance uk segment recorded sales of 418 2 million an increase of 181 2 as the figures of last year only included sales since the acquisition closing date of august 7 2017 organic growth of 5 3 was driven primarily by the opening of company owned stores ebitda for this segment was 27 1 million compared to 6 0 million in 2017 excluding special items adjusted ebitda was 28 3 million compared to 6 0 million the adjusted ebitda margin increase of 280 basis points is the result of cost actions taken during the last quarter of 2017 to improve productivity as well as from an improved absorption of fixed costs from consolidating a full twelve months of operations the opening of company owned stores impacted the adjusted ebitda margin by approximately 40 basis points for the period dividends on february 20 2019 the uni select board of directors declared a quarterly

management team shareholders suppliers and customers for their ongoing support we encountered many unforeseen challenges over the past year but we have put in place plans to mitigate their impact and position the corporation to address a changing environment concluded mr courville outlook the information included within this section contains guidance for uni select in 2019 excluding any potential impact from the review of strategic alternatives and does not take into consideration new accounting standards coming into force in 2019 particularly with respect to ifrs 16 on leases the corporation recognizes that certain factors and uncertainties have impacted results for 2018 and will continue to provide a prudent view of 2019 guidance uni select consolidated adjusted ebitda margin 5 75 6 75 consolidated organic sales growth 1 25 3 25 the above mentioned information is related to the 2019 financial year and may differ from quarter to quarter due to seasonality as well uni select anticipates investments between 25 0 million and 30 0 million in 2019 on capital leases for vehicle fleet hardware equipment software and others for 2019 on a consolidated basis we anticipate revenues to increase modestly and profitability to decrease mainly due to the finishmaster us segment more specifically the overall results from the canadian automotive group segment are expected to be more favourable when compared to last year considering the planned integration of some company owned stores and distribution centres as well as the contribution of the 18 company owned stores from the acquisition in november 2018 of autochoice parts and paints limited for the parts alliance uk segment while we expect results for 2019 to improve over 2018 as we pursue our strategy to open greenfield company owned stores and develop the uk market the next few months are expected to be somewhat more volatile as a result of the uncertainty surrounding brexit as for the finishmaster us segment 2019 is expected to remain a challenging year since the benefits related to the performance improvement plan should start to materialize in the latter part of the year our guidance for 2019 takes these factors and uncertainties into consideration conference call uni select will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter results for 2018 on february 20 2019 at 8 00 am eastern to join the

used by the corporation which are not defined by ifrs organic growth this measure consists of quantifying the increase in consolidated sales between two given periods excluding the impact of acquisitions exchange rate fluctuations and when necessary the variance in the number of billing days this measure enables uni select to evaluate the intrinsic trend in the sales generated by its operational base in comparison with the rest of the market determining the rate of organic growth based on findings that management regards as reasonable may differ from the actual rate of organic growth ebitda this measure represents net earnings excluding finance costs depreciation and amortization and income taxes this measure is a financial indicator of a corporation s ability to service

measures is to provide additional information these adjustments include among other things restructuring and other charges severance and retention bonuses related to management changes as well as net transaction charges amortization of the premium on foreign currency options and amortization of intangible assets related to the parts alliance acquisition management considers the parts alliance

precious metals are a useful asset class within a diversified portfolio gold is a store of wealth that protects against currency weakness while gold stocks are investments albeit historically not well managed as a group silver and platinum are hybrids in the sense that they have a lot of industrial applications but can also serve as stores of wealth however precious metals are a controversial subject many people invest in them heavily and have a strong attachment to them while others consider them unsuitable for inclusion in any respectable portfolio i m a moderate in this sense i have no strong feelings either way but invest in precious metals when the price is right and the winds are in their favor they re a defensive asset class that can provide good returns when appropriately priced and during times of turmoil in particular i have a simple framework for determining roughly what i m willing to pay for gold which can then be extrapolated to other precious metals i don t try to time or trade gold over the short term i merely assess whether it s reasonably priced and worth holding for the long term asset price inflation as i have shown in a couple articles net worth relative to income is at record levels in the united states which some people refer to as the everything bubble chart source st louis federal reserve the combination of low interest rates and money printing has inflated asset prices even though it hasn t inflated consumer prices for everyday goods stocks real estate bonds and gold have all been propped upto high levels in part by very easy monetary policy the broad money supply per capita of the u s has grown a lot more quickly than the consumer price index over the past 20 years due to the slowing velocity of that money and other factors it hasn t translated into higher prices on everyday goods but it has translated into higher prices of financial assets the u s economy is nearly ten years into what is likely to soon become the longest economic expansion in the united states however many late cycle elements have built up including record corporate debt to gdp a flat yield curve potentially peaking house sales and vehicle sales and a central bank that is trying to gradually tighten monetary policy and finding it challenging to do most recession indicators aren t flashing red for the next two quarters but many of them are flashing yellow for a slowdown over the next two years on top of that cyclical aspect the u s has major structural deficits including a very high fiscal deficit as a percentage of gdp compared to what it was during other bull markets a steadily increasing federal debt as a percentage of gdp a permanent trade deficit a weaker middle class than most other developed countries based on median net worth underfunded pension systems and underfunded future liabilities for medicare and social security during the next recession or the one thereafter there are 4 economic bubbles in particular that i m concerned about unfolding many investors who are bearish on the economy believe that gold gld is the answer to these problems that gold especially physical gold but potentially also gold stocks and gold etfs can protect investors from unusually high asset valuations they argue that everything is in a bubble including stocks bonds and real estate and that gold and some other commodities are among the only things that are not in a bubble the problem with that assessment is that based on most measures gold is part of the everything bubble rather than left out of it it has already inflated to high price levels as a financial asset its price has outpaced the consumer price index its price growth has even outpaced the median home price growth over the past 25 years compared to the growth of money supply per capita gold does not appear to be particularly undervalued or overvalued in terms of usd but rather somewhere in the range of fairly valued compared to its multi decade historical average this is why i titled the article the way it is many gold bulls argue that gold is woefully undervalued and suppressed in price but i think the data show otherwise i merely believe it to be appropriately priced or mildly moderately undervalued and thus am moderately bullish on it in a world full of things that are overvalued silver platinum and several other commodities on the other hand are historically very inexpensive and arguably quite undervalued gold appears fairly valued according to the world gold council less than 200 000 tonnes of gold have been mined in human history with about 2 500 3 000 more tonnes being produced in a given year unlike most other commodities almost all gold is thought to be maintained or recycled in perpetuity with only trace percentages discarded in electronic waste with less than 200 000 tonnes of refined gold in existence and a 2 500 3 000 tonne year global annual production rate there is about one ounce of gold in the world for each human and the amount of gold grows roughly as fast as the human population the u s broad money supply is growing quickly per capita while the amount of gold per capita is relatively fixed thus gold should gradually appreciate in price over time at a rate roughly equal to the growth of money supply per capita which has averaged over 5 per year for nearly five decades now sometimes gold gets ahead of this trend and sometimes it falls behind but it logically and historically reverts to the mean another way to put it is that dollars should gradually devalue such that it takes more of them to buy an ounce of gold because the amount of dollars in existence per person is continually growing while the amount of gold in existence per person is not this following chart shows the growth of broad money supply per capita in the u s red line compared to gold prices blue line indexed to 100 in 1995 chart source st louis federal reserve when gold hit major bubbles in 1980 and 2011 its price growth had majorly outpaced the growth of money supply per capita investors at those times feared the possibility of a dollar crisis due to major inflation 1980 or money printing 2011 so the price of gold was bid up in preparation for a dollar crisis when that dollar crisis never fully came gold gradually fell back to normal levels over time to continue to track the growth of broad money supply per capita the only lengthy period where the price of gold trended below the growth of per capita money supply was in the late 1990s and early 2000s at that time the economy was booming money supply growth was stable and low and real interest rates were rather high meaning it was more attractive to hold cash in a bank or buy u s treasuries than to buy gold thus gold was very much out of favor this eventually proved to be among the best times to buy gold in modern history right now gold is fairly valued against the broad money supply per capita compared to how it was in 1995 or in the mid 1970s its current value has not dramatically outpaced money supply per capita like it did in 1980 and 2011 nor is it trending below the growth of money supply per capita like it did in the early 2000s it has greatly outpaced consumer price inflation and has even outpaced the price growth of the median house this chart is the same as the one above but also adds the median house price over time indexed to 100 in 1995 green line chart source st louis federal reserve as a second valuation check it s also of course important to pay attention to the supply demand balance of gold and the profitability of gold miners a supply reduction or a demand increase can cause spikes or troughs in the gold price i like to look at the aisc and free cash flows of the biggest miners in the gold stock etf gdx if they are insanely profitable that s a red flag that the price of gold may have gotten ahead of itself if they are closing down and going bankrupt then gold may be undervalued and that higher prices would be needed to keep production online if they are struggling somewhat but doing okay gold is most likely in the ballpark of being appropriately valued which is what i see when i look at a variety of gold miners today more specifically many of the gold majors i follow are profitable but have dwindling reserves since recent gold prices have been enough to keep good miners profitable but have not been enough to justify major spending on exploration and development as a result there has been an increase in m a activity within the industry as the companies try to consolidate their reserves that s a case for at least mild undervaluation in gold a note on silver and platinum silver slv on the other hand is trending well below average valuation the gold to silver ratio is historically quite high at over 80 which when combined with the idea that gold is approximately fairly valued or mildly undervalued implies that silver is significantly undervalued historically when gold price spikes higher the gold to silver ratio shrinks meaning there s a tendency for silver to spike even higher indeed the long term expected demand growth for silver from electric vehicles solar panels and electronics in general is bullish for silver prices but anything goes in the short term data by ycharts platinum in the past several years has also become deeply undervalued in respect to its historical relationship with gold the caveat with platinum and palladium is that their principal industrial use is in combustion vehicles which may face long term gradual demand destruction by electric vehicles which don t need catalytic converters in the meantime it is unusual for platinum to be priced so much below gold and palladium data by ycharts gold stocks additionally are trading at historically low valuations compared to gold based on the xau to gold ratio in other words gold miners are the second cheapest they ve ever been relative to the price of gold with the only cheaper period being a few years ago at the gold bottom in 2015 2016 it s important to be picky with gold stocks however because as a group they ve been historically bad managers of capital and have underperformed the metals they mine data by ycharts the role of gold in a portfolio rather than merely being an inflation hedge gold serves a variety of purposes in a portfolio gold is insurance against a currency crisis a nice hedge during recessions and a play on perpetually low interest rates and quantitative easing going forward unlike real estate gold tends to appreciate in price during recessions due to investor fear however on a fundamental basis it s not currently any cheaper than median residential real estate relative to the growth of the u s money supply silver is a deeper value play some people point out that precious metals don t keep up with stocks over the long term but it really depends on when you buy and how long you define long to be gold has outpaced the s p 500 spy and the nasdaq 100 qqq over the past 20 years due to how highly valued stocks were at that time and how undervalued gold was but if you measure from gold price peaks in 1980 or 2011 gold s returns have been bad gold historically gives good risk adjusted returns when bought at cheap or moderate prices during times when equities are highly valued moreover i view gold mostly as competing for a spot in a portfolio against cash and bonds rather than necessarily competing against stocks and on that front it has done quite well data by ycharts i sold my gold and silver coins that i collected as a youngster to a local shop in 2011 when they became overvalued went on to ignore the space for a few years and started buying back in the past two years up to a 5 7 allocation when gold fell back to its trend against the broad money supply per capita comparable to its 1995 valuation and as stocks became highly valued based on a number of metrics i believe gold is a healthy part of a diversified portfolio but i want to caution investors against the idea that it s the one magical asset class that can save them from economic calamity other hard assets like real estate outside of high priced cities and infrastructure assets are desirable as well good solid companies with in demand products and services that produce strong free cash flows and have fortress balance sheets are also solid choices to hold through market turmoil over the very long run i expect gold to continue to appreciate in price in terms of dollars at about the same rate as the growth of per capita money supply which has averaged over 5 per year with occasional spikes over it due to fear which are hard to predict in comparison vanguard recently reported that they expect about 5 annual returns from u s stocks over the next decade when real interest rates are low like they are now it would make sense for gold to err on the side of trending a bit above the growth of the money supply per capita since there is less opportunity cost for holding it compared to cash or sovereign bonds in contrast during periods of high real interest rates and stable economic growth it wouldn t be unusual to see the price of gold trend below the growth of the money supply per capita since the opportunity cost of holding it is significant historically gold price movements as a percent change per year red line are inversely correlated with real treasury yields blue line scaled by a factor of 10 for clarity during periods of inflation in the 1970s gold spiked higher when real treasury yields were negative then during the 1980s 1990s and early 2000s the u s enjoyed a sustained economic boom with consistently high real interest rates which kept the price of gold stable and low during the global financial crisis and its aftermath real interest rates became practically zero in response to this as well as global debt crises and quantitative easing gold spiked high once again before gradually falling back to its trend as things stabilized against resumed economic growth given that we seem to be perpetually in a low real interest rate environment for much of the developed world going forward the existing high debt levels can t support higher interest rates at this point and gold is at a balanced price relative to money supply per capita gold appears to be a reasonably good investment that should continue to appreciate in the long term even if it of course has various dips along the way i personally like to hold a little bit of physical gold and then a broad array of gold streaming and royalty companies like franco nevada fnv wheaton precious metals wpm royal gold rgld sandstorm sand and osisko gold royalties or as a group gold royalty and streaming companies have outperformed the price of gold and gold miners over the past decade because their diversified business model of financing gold mines is more stable than doing the dirty work of actually mining gold they have less explosive upside potential but are better at riding out the downturns which suits the purpose of my investment in them some of them became rather expensive years ago but have drifted down to better valuations in recent years data by ycharts in addition i am holding a select number of historically well managed gold silver miners currently i have small positions in the new barrick gold agnico eagle aem b2gold btg fortuna silver mines fsm and first majestic silver ag summary thoughts growth of the gold price logically and historically tracks the growth of per capita money supply over time which has averaged over 5 per year during the past several decades compared to estimated stock cash and bond returns over the next decade gold is a favorable risk reward asset class currently to include within a portfolio gold tends to deviate from the trend to the upside during times of currency uncertainty and low real interest rates inversely gold has more rarely deviated from the trend to the downside during periods of high real interest rates and strong economic growth shrinking in ground reserves among gold majors increased gold buying from central banks perpetually low real interest rates and the observation that we re likely relatively late in the u s business cycle are all bullish for gold there s a good case to hold some precious metals at this price point and they re best thought of as competing against a portion of cash and bonds when deciding whether they fit within a portfolio gold stocks can be thought of as competing against traditional equities but generally with just a small allocation at best i have a 5 7 allocation to precious metals royalty companies and select miners and will rebalance this segment back to its target as dips occur in particular there are 4 gold stocks i like for 2019

illustration by tang yau hoong there can be few more eye catching signs of the economic vibrancy of southeast asia than competition for ride hailing services on the streets of its biggest cities in jakarta the bustling capital of indonesia it is hard to miss the green helmeted motorbike taxi riders of go jek a homegrown company that has built a thriving ride hailing business in only eight years go jek which derives its name from ojek an indonesian word for motorbike taxi launched its first overseas foray in september 2018 by entering vietnam and tapping into the fast growing ride hailing scene in ho chi minh city hanoi and other cities next up are expansions into thailand the philippines and singapore those moves will pit go jek against the region s biggest ride hailing company singapore based grab and competitors such as ryde and mvl sparking a battle for the region s booming ride sharing market it is a tussle involving considerable sums of money from some big investors grab founded by a malaysian businessman and operating in eight markets in southeast asia raised us 2 billion in 2018 after a round of funding that attracted investment from toyota and valued the company at 11 billion go jek which already counts chinese e commerce giant tencent and singapore s state investment company temasek as investors reportedly is in discussions to raise 2 billion to bolster its regional expansion plans ride sharing companies are just one example of the rampant commercial activity in southeast asia the association of southeast asian nations asean a 10 nation bloc founded in 1967 stretches from myanmar in the west to the philippines on its eastern flank the other eight members are brunei cambodia indonesia laos malaysia singapore thailand and vietnam the grouping has a population of 630 million 30 percent larger than the combined population of the nafta countries and its nations had a combined gdp of 2 76 trillion in 2017 which is larger than the gdp of india and makes asean the fifth largest economy in the world its dynamism its growing middle class and the entrepreneurial flair of its businesses have made asean one of the consistently best performing regions in the world since the 2008 financial crisis so it s no surprise that a large number of investors and multinationals are turning their focus to asean s dynamic markets the bloc s economies are at vastly different stages of political and economic development singapore s gdp per capita of 57 713 dwarfs that of myanmar at 1 278 as of 2017 but they all share immense growth potential and aside from serving as a major global hub for manufacturing and trade the bloc offers one of the fastest growing consumer markets in the world the region s middle class is projected to rise to almost two thirds of the overall population by 2030 compared with only 29 percent in 2010 having grown at a 4 8 percent rate for the last five years asean is projected to grow by 5 2 percent on average over the next five years according to the oecd cambodia laos myanmar and vietnam are expected to record growth rates among the highest in the region ranging between 6 and 7 percent over the same period few regions of the world or individual countries can project such numbers at the 50th meeting of asean economic ministers in november 2018 in singapore which held the customary rotating chair of the bloc throughout that year the city state s prime minister lee hsien loong predicted that the grouping would be the world s fourth largest economy by 2030 behind only the u s china and the european union much of the region s strength can be attributed to a demographic dividend fully 60 percent of its vast population is under 35 years old and as these young workers have entered the workforce in huge numbers they have proved a valuable source of human capital and growing consumer power most of go jek s and grab s indonesian motorbike drivers are under 35 however as other countries in the region have found there is another side to the demographic story an aging population vietnam is a case in point the third most populous country in asean it is also one of the most rapidly aging countries in the world in 2017 one in every nine people or 11 percent of vietnam s population of 95 million was age 60 or older according to the government statistics office that proportion will rise to about 20 percent by 2038 the international monetary fund forecasts that neighboring thailand faces the likelihood that by 2050 its old age dependency ratio those 65 and older as a share of those between 15 and 64 will rise to more than 50 percent up from 15 percent today a development that will noticeably shrink the country s working age population this structural shift points to an emerging drag on asean s growth prospects because it spells a net decline in working age populations in some of its leading economies see the demographic challenge in the asia pacific region in short some countries have a limited demographic window available to maximize economic growth indeed the graying population provides but one argument for our contention that the era of passive growth for asean is over despite a growth story that has been largely unblemished since the asian financial crisis of the late 1990s a number of challenges have raised questions about the sustainability of the bloc s growth trajectory over the next half century these include external challenges such as a recent slowdown in short term economic growth and the impact of industry 4 0 as well as three major internal challenges weak productivity high external trade dependence and huge infrastructure gaps but demographic trends are not necessarily destiny and neither are the other structural challenges asean faces the region has a suite of advantages and resources it can deploy to power through the rising headwinds and we believe that by confronting and addressing its challenges head on by taking active measures the 10 members of asean can show the world that the timely interventions that so often have eluded governments and regional groupings in the past not only are possible but indeed can chart a new trajectory for sustainable prosperity asean s trajectory is also of high relevance to companies in the u s europe and other parts of asia such as japan because of the strategic importance of the bloc s markets shipping lanes supply chains and supply of industrial labor the narrow malacca strait is the busiest shipping lane between the indian ocean and the pacific ocean thailand is the region s hub for automotive production and is sometimes dubbed the detroit of the east thanks to its highly developed automotive manufacturing ecosystem involving big oems such as general motors and nissan as well as suppliers malaysia has a well developed electronics cluster centered on the port city of penang with shipping and air freight connections globally the philippines has a thriving business process outsourcing sector that is used by many multinational companies and singapore is the region s undisputed financial and commodities trading center it also boasts the world s largest bunkering fuel storage port collectively the nations of asean represent a vast market of mobile savvy consumers and e commerce digital payments and fintech generally are booming adapting is of particularly high relevance now thanks to tectonic shifts underway in geopolitics and the evolving nature of global trading relationships demographic changes and the spread of globalization have served as twin engines propelling the region s growth and as the aging population saps one source of propulsion uncertainties about the evolution of the global trading system could further weaken momentum there is a risk that asean s core value proposition of lower labor costs could fade away over the coming decades as protectionist sentiment rises and new technologies improve the economics of retaining or re shoring production within the borders of the developed parts of the world the political mood in many countries has shifted against free trade and in particular the recent trade tensions between the united states and china are worrying concerns singapore s prime minister lee told the asean summit at the end of 2018 asean countries will have to react to these major external trends internal challenges in an increasingly competitive global economy stagnating productivity is becoming more of a concern around the world and in asean labor productivity has doubled across the bloc since 1990 but industry data indicates a wide gap between asean and global markets at present that highlights an opportunity for the bloc to improve through interventions such as investments in human capital infrastructure development institutional improvements and digital technology adoption the international labour organization ilo found in 2017 that most countries in asean especially the emerging markets recorded much lower output per worker than their global counterparts see the labor productivity gap but singapore widely recognized for the economic miracle it has achieved since its creation as an independent city state in 1965 recorded a mere 0 2 percent growth in labor productivity in 2015 16 a fraction of the more than 2 percent annual growth over 2000 10 thailand and malaysia scored comparatively poorly as well these two maturing economies are also witnessing strong growth in wage levels while already having some of the highest minimum wages in asean although such wage growth bolsters consumer spending it also increases the need to improve worker productivity to counter growing labor costs in fact rising wage levels soon will dilute the low cost advantage enjoyed by many emerging asean markets over competitors in their hemisphere and around the world some asean countries are estimated to have recorded among the highest real wage increases worldwide in 2017 with vietnam 7 2 percent thailand 5 6 percent and indonesia 4 9 percent leading the trend these figures are much higher than the global average of 2 3 percent the misalignment of productivity and wage growth will gradually lead to diminishing economic competitiveness greater unemployment lower profit margins and diminished investor confidence coupled with an aging population the pincers of weak productivity and strong wage growth will put further pressure on these economies to strengthen their institutions and capabilities and thus strengthen their long term economic prospects but for more immediate help one place to look is digital technologies which can significantly affect productivity according to the most recent annual global connectivity index released by huawei technologies a single point improvement in a nation s digital connectivity score which runs on a scale from 20 to 85 could lead to more than a 2 percent increase in productivity and national competitiveness developed asean countries singapore brunei in particular having more advanced institutions and infrastructure and hence limited scope for improvement on this front as well as having aging populations should focus on increasing their adoption of technology to counter declining productivity growth asean markets will need to prioritize productivity improvement measures to boost economic growth or risk losing out to global competitors in addition to making regulatory interventions such as a reduction in non tariff trade barriers this will also require local governments and the private sector to invest in new digital technologies and infrastructure development the grouping also needs to figure out how to navigate technological disruption industry 4 0 which is bringing new technologies such as automation augmented reality cloud computing and the internet of things iot to bear on established processes and facilities could produce much needed benefits in the form of better jobs greater connectivity improved services such as healthcare and education and more business and investment however as with any revolution some people feel a negative impact in the short term asean could be such a potential victim of industry 4 0 take automation we see a scenario in which multinational corporations re shore some manufacturing to developed markets and adopt 4 0 technologies in those plants they keep in asean a scenario that would hit a less developed asean member such as cambodia or myanmar particularly hard in general the results could lead to increased unemployment a reduction in disposable incomes and potential social unrest and economic contraction in an increasingly competitive global economy stagnating productivity is becoming more of a concern around the world and in asean in addition technological disruption comes with its own set of challenges for example if robots become cheaper to employ than humans will expanding manufacturing capacity still lead to job creation in a 2016 report the ilo found that around 56 percent of all employment in five key emerging asean countries cambodia indonesia the philippines thailand and vietnam faced a high risk of automation in the subsequent 20 years together these five countries represent a vast majority about 80 percent of asean s workforce at present creating a vibrant and integrated innovation ecosystem to teach it and technology skills is another issue asean will have to deal with in order to minimize these potential job losses such an ecosystem will require closer collaboration among different stakeholders including large multinationals entrepreneurs government agencies and research institutions to foster skills in new areas relevant to a digitized world such as data sciences digital user experience human centered design and cybersecurity intra regional cooperation will need to be enhanced more advanced production hubs such as singapore and thailand will need to take the lead in testing new technologies and in developing best practices to improve adoption across the rest of the region and among less productive segments such as small and medium sized enterprises balancing trade external trade dependence the degree to which a region produces goods and services for countries outside the region has been a persistent feature of asean for many years in particular the bloc faces significant risks associated with its high level of dependence on the u s and on china which together accounted for 26 percent of trade in goods as of 2017 asean exports to china increased in value by an average of 10 percent annually over the past 10 years reaching 17 percent of all asean trade in goods in 2017 any deepening of the current slowdown in the chinese economy amid efforts to shift it to a more consumption driven model could impact trade the extent of these linkages can be judged by estimates released by oxford economics which suggest that a drop of one percentage point in china s gdp growth in the future could reduce asean exports by 0 3 to 0 6 percent moreover global trade growth is also slowing down with the wto downgrading its outlook for 2018 and 2019 citing significant downside risks to its growth projections at the same time intra asean trade i e commerce between member states although it has risen in value from 164 billion in 2005 to 311 billion in 2017 has remained stagnant over the past decade at around 25 percent of all exports by contrast intra european union e u trade represented 64 percent of overall e u exports in 2017 to a large degree production in asean consists of so called intermediate goods such as electronic components that are part of global supply chains and thus destined for end markets where the goods are either assembled or consumed get the strategy business newsletter delivered to your inbox sample email email address ominously protectionist sentiment is rising around the world this has been expressed most vividly in the region by the withdrawal of the u s from the trans pacific partnership tpp in 2017 and could further threaten asean s trade growth it is therefore important for the group to take active measures to increase intra regional trade flows to not only serve the fast growing domestic consumer base but also counterbalance these additional risks a key measure needed to help boost intraregional trade is the strengthening of regional cooperation especially through the reduction of non tariff trade barriers mahathir mohamad malaysia s 93 year old prime minister told policymakers and business leaders at the 2018 singapore summit that pushing the 25 percent share up to 30 percent might seem ambitious but was possible given the grouping s strength in numbers this is not the time to close our doors by invoking trade protectionism measures but instead we should be actively engaging in finding amicable solutions and resolving trade issues through multilateral dialogues such as between asean countries the prime minister said the good news is that 96 percent of tariff lines and 70 percent of intra asean trade flows are currently tariff free but customs and levies aren t the only factors that inhibit trade the elephant in the room in this context is the many non tariff barriers in the region the result of the steady implementation by asean member states of non tariff measures ntms there has been a consistent rise in the number of ntms which are often aimed at bolstering domestic companies and industries and which have stifled intraregional activity see erecting barriers this mix of import and export related policies has grown substantially from 1 634 measures in the year 2000 to a high of 5 975 measures in 2015 across asean in terms of the type of ntms 43 percent are import restrictions related to technical product requirements 33 percent take the form of sanitary measures related to public health and safety and 13 percent are export related restrictions as an example of an ntm in asean a company certified to sell halal food products in malaysia needs to undergo recertification to export to indonesia to adhere to the indonesian industry s halal standard which has significant time and cost implications for the exporter similarly the thai government imposes stringent licensing requirements for the import of raw materials petroleum industrial machinery textiles pharmaceuticals and agricultural items infrastructure gaps patchy infrastructure is a third significant challenge although the stage of development varies significantly from country to country it is clear that across asean people s daily experience is too often one of clogged roads inadequate bridges and regular power outages as in other developing parts of the world infrastructure limitations continue to slow the pace of growth significant gaps exist across a range of sectors for example utilities transportation and logistics and digital connectivity as of mid 2018 only 20 percent of roads in myanmar were paved and only 53 percent of cambodian households had access to grid quality electricity the indonesian national development planning agency estimates that a lack of adequate transportation infrastructure and the resultant traffic congestion accounts for more than 4 billion in annual losses to the city of jakarta in the form of fuel wastage productivity losses and health impact on its residents total infrastructure investment needs in asean from 2016 to 2030 are estimated by the asian development bank adb to be around 2 8 trillion indicating an annual investment requirement of 184 billion equivalent to 7 percent of the bloc s gross domestic product in 2017 in addition to reducing the productive capacity of the workforce these gaps increase the cost of doing business for companies hindering national competitiveness while limiting market access and social well being for example logistics costs in 2016 represented about 9 percent of gross domestic product in germany and 12 percent in brazil in vietnam the figure was 21 percent whereas in indonesia asean s largest economy and most populous nation it was as high as 26 percent yet enhancing the scale and quality of infrastructure could have a significant economic impact on these countries especially in helping to manage looming issues related to productivity and job creation for example estimates by the adb indicate that a 10 percent increase in paved road density could result in a 1 percent increase in trade and a 5 percent improvement in economic growth across asia finally a significant gap exists in terms of what we might call institutional maturity as is the case in most emerging economies the business environment in asean is still maturing and is marked by institutional gaps that weaken international investor confidence and the region s growth more so during periods of global uncertainty corruption in particular features as a major concern for businesses operating in the region in the asean business outlook survey 2017 conducted by the u s chamber of commerce 65 percent of respondents cited what they saw as unfair and inefficient law enforcement practices as a major challenge in the region with the exception of singapore and brunei those operating in the mekong region said they faced stronger pressures to pay bribes in order to obtain essential permits and government services besides corruption lack of regulatory clarity continues to impede growth a significant percentage of businesses 42 percent indicated that consultations between the government and the private sector were limited while new laws and regulations were being developed a path forward the scale of challenges asean faces is immense and seemingly daunting but the region has substantial resources at its disposal and we believe that three sets of active measures will allow the region to continue to make progress through the headwinds it faces the first involves renewed efforts by the asean secretariat which was set up in 1976 to coordinate the bloc s initiatives and provide governance and implementation help for policies a key priority for the jakarta based body should be facilitating internal trade in particular fostering the harmonization of multiple non trade barriers to create a more fluid internal economy within asean a boost to the secretariat s budget and staff would be helpful too the second set of measures would be for member countries to tackle head on their shared demographic challenges in productivity and aging populations given that countries are at different stages of development and face different degrees of demographic challenge these measures should include short term policy interventions such as addressing talent gaps through encouraging inward migration and long term reforms targeted at improving the labor force participation of women and older people for example in fast aging markets such as singapore and thailand only 60 percent of women participated in the workforce in 2017 compared with 77 percent of men specific interventions will also need to target a range of other levers including human capital trade technology and investments which will vary by market in asean see demographic and income trends in asean countries the third set of measures revolves around the private sector which will have a major role to play in making these interventions in asean and thus in strengthening the region s growth prospects over the coming years companies will need not only to provide new products and services to meet varying consumer preferences but also to work more closely with governments to develop the right conditions for businesses to prosper the principal measures the private sector should pursue are described below develop more localized business models conduct more research and development locally bringing about a transition to more localized sourcing production and sales through the development of regional hubs to serve asean consumers for example automakers looking to establish a bigger foothold in the region can increase localization more holistically in sourcing manufacturing sales and research and development doing so will allow them to offer greater competitiveness more localized products and greater differentiation this strategy could be adopted in phases as companies gain further appreciation of local markets shifting from a production model based on semi knocked down assembly in which factories receive partially assembled parts to one based on assembling completely knocked down kits in which factories receive unassembled parts and then finally to full scale production automakers can progress to the final stage of full scale production as they establish more reliable long term production volumes aiming to achieve local sourcing of 70 percent or more to fully leverage tax incentives in the region it will also be important to work with government and associations to ensure that the right level of skilled workers are coming into the market healthcare offers a particularly compelling opportunity for developing localized business models government and healthcare leaders are aware that this region is at a critical point with its aging population chronic diseases such as diabetes will need to be tackled with appropriate care at an affordable price medical device companies have an important job in asean to improve the access affordability and quality of healthcare but rather than simply import expensive devices from the u s and europe medical device companies might borrow a page from china s or india s playbook and seek to build customized and affordable devices for the market using local and regional business models to meet patients needs for example ge healthcare found that its premium priced ultrasound scanners were unaffordable for 90 percent of hospitals in china through local r d sales and marketing ge healthcare s china team developed a handheld ultrasound scanner at 15 percent of the original cost this product is now being used even in developed markets as a portable scanner in ambulances and operating rooms to further improve affordability companies can also offer financing alternatives to local hospitals such as leasing and contracting of medical equipment supplemented with a regular program of upgrading and maintaining the equipment embrace a holistic digital operating model the adoption of digital capabilities can improve the production and transportation of goods and services as well as communication with consumers and businesses with expectations of mass customization being brought about by industry 4 0 a unified asean market promises the formation of a truly massive consumer base that could push growth in local production to meet its requirements for more personalized products coupled with quicker order fulfillment in segments such as footwear accessories and consumer electronics companies have a significant opportunity to grow across asean by leveraging digital capabilities not only to connect directly with consumers to inform and influence purchasing habits but also to employ greater efficiencies throughout their supply chain using platforms such as iot or blockchain to track and trace assets products people equipment across the value chain or to improve access to trade finance for smaller enterprises furthermore warehouses which are currently labor and paper intensive are ripe for conversion to automated systems providing better visibility on inventory technological change brings exciting solutions to persistent problems yet is disrupting jobs and economic development pathways justin wood head of the regional agenda for asia pacific and member of the executive committee at the world economic forum points out the countries of asean have every chance of harnessing these disruptions for their benefit but success will require a new approach to policymaking and new commitment to regional cooperation use partnerships and integration models developing partnerships and alliances that cross sectors and involve industry disruptors will be crucial as companies try to stay relevant and competitive while meeting consumers expectations profitably new business models such as platform sharing for example for automotive production or vertical integration such as fuel refining with petrochemicals are other strategies relevant to addressing the increasing cost of production in asean platform sharing enables cost savings from the use of similar components and more efficient inventory management and allows automakers to redirect spending to other areas such as adapting models to regional consumers or improving product design similarly integrating refining units with petrochemical facilities could enhance operational efficiencies through greater synergy and flexibility in operations resulting in much stronger margins an integrated complex with crude processing capacity of around 200 000 barrels per stream day could generate gross margins of approximately 9 to 15 per barrel depending on market conditions and operational factors as compared with only 3 to 6 per barrel for a stand alone refinery governments in the region see these challenges through a domestic lens which is understandable given the developing economic maturity of most of its member nations yet we think they should recognize the value of regional integration and cooperation and take action to strengthen the position of asean on a number of fronts so that it can maintain its reputation as the world s most compelling growth story annual gdp growth in leading asean economies both emerging and developed has been on a downward trajectory since peaking in 2010 as global uncertainties result in somewhat stagnant growth projections in the short term the good news is that much of what needs to be done is already underway take for example the strategies and the growth of burgeoning ride sharing companies such as go jek and grab both have pioneered localized business models because they are homegrown and tailored to local workers and customers they have been able to establish a strong market presence both are embracing holistic digital operating models relying on apps and connectivity to deliver a new type of service and to function as a platform for other types of businesses including payments both are in effect facilitating intra asean connectivity and taking a broader view of their horizons by operating in multiple countries within asean the need in the coming years will be for more companies organizations governments and leaders to be equally proactive and innovative in developing and executing strategies that will fulfill the potential of asean it s time to act author profiles david wijeratne is a partner with pwc singapore he leads pwc s growth markets centre a global team of experts

albert einstein is widely credited with saying the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results the south african federation of trade unions saftu said in a statement on monday ahead of this week s budget saftu s statement reads minister of finance tito mboweni s 2019 budget speech on 20 february 2019 will be delivered in the midst of south africa s biggest crisis since 1994 but saftu has no expectation that he will deliver any solution to this crisis he will deliver more of his predecessors catastrophic neoliberal business as usual policies which caused today s crisis in the first place policies dictated by the credit ratings agencies on behalf of multinational big business for nearly 25 years now the anc government has implemented an inappropriate macroeconomic policy framework that has led to economic stagnation worsened unemployment deepened poverty and made south africa the worst country in the world in terms of inequality these gear growth employment and distribution macroeconomic and fiscal policies included massive corporate tax cuts at a time when the world expected that we would introduce wealth and solidarity taxes to close the gap between the white and black inequalities we inherited from apartheid the anc government introduced monetary policies that led to the cutting of exchange controls resulting in billions leaving our shores money we so desperately needed to build new industries government allowed our big companies to shift their listing to london and new york again robbing our economy of resources we need the anc introduced inflation target policies of between 3 and 6 as if this is not enough of a sabotage of the development agenda the anc did nothing to stop illicit cash and trade outflows and mispricing that cost the economy billions these have been the anc government s policies since the imposition of the gear strategy in 1996 which ensured that economic power would remain in the hands of the same mainly white capitalist class and that financial policies would be dictated by their interests workers and the poor will now yet again have to pay the price though tax increases and cuts in spending on key public services which will lead to even more job losses in both the public and private sectors one of gear s biggest champions was former finance minister trevor manuel who boasted in 2008 that he had achieved a budget surplus for the first time since 1958 he achieved this through austerity budgets for the poor with tax cuts for the rich his budgets robbed us of the resources the country required to meet the basic needs of the poor black majority who remain trapped in the apartheid racial fault lines these neoliberal policies together with inaction to stop illicit cash flows foreign listing of companies the removal of exchange controls and reduction tariffs have all contributed to the current economic catastrophe in which economic growth last year was below 1 and the world bank estimates it will be no more than 1 3 this year which will not keep pace with the expected 1 6 increase in the population unemployment at 37 0 is the one of the sixth highest in the world still more job losses loom with threatened retrenchments in eskom the mines the public service and possibly the sabc saa and edcon 55 of the population live in abject poverty and six million children live below the food poverty line inequality is the world s highest executives salaries have risen from 50 times bigger than workers wages to 500 times bigger the share of wages in gdp has plummeted from 57 in 1991 to below 50 inequality has also grown by cuts in the social wage spending on public services by years of austerity budgets the two tier level of service delivery remains and is widening education remains starkly divided between well endowed private schools for a wealthy mainly white minority while most public schools for the majority are under staffed ill equipped and often structurally derelict public hospitals and clinics struggle with over worked staff lack of drugs and long queues for treatment while the rich can pay for quality private service 14 of south africans still live in shacks and backyard dwellings all these problems have been made far worse by the wave of corruption theft and fraud by public officials soe executives political leaders and their cronies in the private sector which has lost the country an estimated r27 billion a year workers and the poor will now yet again have to pay the price for all these problems through tax increases and cuts in spending on key public services which will lead to even more job losses in both the public and private sectors at the top of mboweni s agenda will be measures to reduce the debt gdp ratio level which stands at almost 60 and eskom s massive r420 billion debt which amounts to 15 of all national debt eskom s debt crisis has now coincided with the latest round of load shedding the failure of generators including the two new ones at medupi and kusile and the attempt to impose massive tariff increases this has already wreaked havoc for both domestic users and manufacturing and commercial businesses if not rectified this crisis will lead to an economic implosion of the entire economy for which electricity is its life blood thousands more jobs will be at risk and living standards will plummet what mboweni will not admit however is that the root cause of this crisis was a decision of by his predecessor trevor manuel who in 2009 while boasting about his budget surplus refused a request from the eskom board for a r1000 billion recapitalisation programme this was so as to weaken eskom and eventually hand it over to the private sector a process continuing with the plan to introduce ipps to compete with eskom so that eskom will subsidise the private sector and continuing with the plan to eskom into three components generation distribution and transmission saftu views this as concealed privatisation and is therefore a declaration of war eskom s disaster has been compounded by a decade of corruption incompetence mismanagement and sabotage involving board members private suppliers including gupta owned companies and the anc s investment arm chancellor house which all robbed the public of billions of rands this also led to the massive structural problems and faults at the new power stations which numsa members pointed out years ago but which were ignored in order to cover up the corruption involved in the contracts with the company which built them mboweni knows that eskom is too big to fail and that his budget will have to include a bail out which will once more be paid for by the public with more tax increases and even bigger cuts in public spending on everything in the public sector saftu demands that it is those responsible for the disaster not the workers and consumers who must pay back all the stolen money members of eskom s past and present boards its corrupt suppliers in particular coal suppliers and those in government who oiled the wheels of the hijacking of this public utility those guilty of crimes must be brought to justice and punished mboweni will also not admit that the underlying problem at eskom and in the economy as a whole is that they are owned or in eskom s case managed by a capitalist class who are only interested in making as much money as possible as quickly as possible and without any regard for the dire consequences of this for the workers consumers and the whole country eskom must remain in public ownership but not run as if it had already been privatised it has to be taken out of the hands of corrupt business representatives and run democratically by elected representatives of the workers consumers and the state who must be subject to recall and punished if they repeat the crimes of the former bosses saftu insists that energy including renewables water education healthcare public transport information dissemination public transport including access to roads and security of citizens amongst others should be in the hands of the people as a whole and are too critical to be used for for making profit saftu demands a people s budget which will increase taxes on the rich recover their unpaid taxes and illicitly exported funds stop the laundering of money into tax havens a programme to reverse the deep social expenditure cuts and to increase spending on vital public services and job creating initiatives saftu

conference over to your host to begin please go ahead sir claudio descalzi thank you good afternoon and welcome to the 2018 full year results presentation the transformation undertaken by eni in the last year has allowed us in 2018 to further improve our results both from operational and financial point of view we have been able to accelerate the implementation of our strategy achieving remarkable milestones in terms of geographical diversification and in the rebalancing of our businesses in terms of our priorities in 2018 in safety we ve stated a total recordable injury rate of 0 35 confirming that we are in the lower range of the industry average for the environment we are strongly committed to reduce the carbon footprint of our activities upstream ghg intensity decreased by 6 versus 2016 2017 in 2018 we improved our main kpis from the upstream to the downstream sector increasing our financial and technological efficiencies and with an extensive integration of all our businesses the main highlights for upstream are the new record of production with 1 851 000 barrels per day an increase of 2 5 excluding price effect an exploration of more than barrels of added resources at the unit exploration cost of 1 50 per barrel which confirms our focus on exploration to guarantee organic growth contributing to low breakeven cost moreover also in 2018 we reached a very high level of all sources reserve replacement ratio of 124 which was fostered by new fids taken in the period and finally we increased the value of each produced barrel faster than expected in mid downstream gas power performance was strong with an ebit of â 544 million more than twice that of 2017 this growth has been led by gas portfolio improvement lng and power and remarkable retained contribution of â 201 million downstream performance was slowed down by the high cost of the feedstock the exchange rate effect and market conditions in the refining marketing we reached an ebit of â 390 million for the full year these results represent a 25 reduction versus 2017 in line with the reduction in the refining margin in chemicals downturn was more severe however despite the extreme negative scenario we reached breakeven thus confirming the resilience of our chemical sector from a financial point of view we had one of our best performances of the last decade cash flow from operation of â 13 9 billion is 39 higher than last year including the contribution of â 400 million from the zohr deferred cash in this result driven by our valuable and diversified portfolio has exceeded our original 2019 guidance of â 13 5 billion the efficiency of our investment allow us to lower our full cash neutrality that in 2018 reached 52 per barrel as a result we generate inorganic free cash flow of â 6 5 billion the highest since 2009 with a net debt of â 8 3 billion leverage has dropped to 16 the minimum in the last 12 years and one of the lowest amongst peers and now some color on our recent activities in the middle east the exceptional rate of growth of eni in this region over the last years represent the strategic achievement one which was a major target internal geographical diversification and more balanced portfolio starting from a limited presence in the area we signed 11 contracts from the exploration to the downstream according to our model to be all along the value chain we entered already producing asset that had a high potential growth rate discovered giant field to be developed areas to be explored and one of the largest refineries in the world starting from 2018 production of 40 000 barrels per day from the lower zakum and umm shaif we have added the development of ghasha the largest gas field in abu dhabi offshore based on this from the second half of the next decade we realize our equity production to more than 180 000 barrels per day we acquired 70 000 square kilometer of highly promising low risk equity in oman abu dhabi sharjah and bahrain this is the largest acreage held by an ioc in the region with the risk of trading and potential of around 3 billion barrels of oil and gas in place these areas will be a primary target of our exploration activity in the coming years this potential will be developed leveraging the existing infrastructures we then accelerate into market at low cost overall in the gulf we target a long term equity production of around 100 000 barrels per day in the refining we reached another strategic result with the acquisition of a 20 stake in ruwais which increases our overall refining capacity by 35 without taking into account any further improvement resulting from the already designed expansion plan ruwais is one of best refineries in the world a unique opportunity to rebalance our business structure and improve the average profitability of our refining sector this deal has 2 components first we entered a large flexible producing asset with an important upside potential and second we are establishing a trading jv with our partners to better capture the market potential in europe middle east and far east and africa this is a significant step up in our processing capacity that will further enhance the resilience of our refining system through these acquisitions we will improve our average breakeven margin from about 3 per barrel to around 2 7 per barrel from 2020 and to 1 5 per barrel at the completion of the upgrade projects which will increase the complex refining capacity to 1 1 million barrel per day by 2023 the new development will be entirely self financed by the revenues of the refineries these assets will be equity accounted and will contribute to our cash flow thanks to an attractive dividend distribution policy the key drivers that have characterized this impressive expansion in the region has been the planned deployment of our technology and our operational model from exploration to the refining phase in 2018 we set a new production record with the production of 1 851 000 barrels we grew by 2 5 excluding price effect versus last year mainly thanks to the ramp ups of zohr and nooros in egypt of jangkrik in indonesia and kashagan in kazakhstan and the start ups from octp gas project in ghana wafa compression and bahr essalam phase 2 in namibia and ochigufu and vandumbu in angola lower gas demand due to geopolitical issues in namibia and venezuela and to commercial reasons in ghana has reduced our existing potential growth by about 27 000 barrels per day the last quarter of the year was also impacted by some downtime in u s norway and nigeria during the year we are we more than replaced our sales days organically through the reserves of the year and we re at selling 7 2 billion barrels of which 51 is gas major organics reserve were recorded in egypt with progress in the developments of zohr and fid in mexico area 1 merakes in indonesia and angola including the positive contribution of portfolio we recorded in all sources reserve replacement ratio of 124 and around 11 years of life index in the past five years we have been able to organically replace 130 of our sales let s now move to the upstream economic results 2018 s ebit was â 10 9 billion more than doubling last year s result with an oil price growth in euro of just 25 better performance in terms of production mix and volumes contributed more than â 1 billion to the ebit growth of â 5 7 billion upstream operating cash flow was â 12 9 billion 55 higher than in 17 our generation per barrel thanks to an improved production mix was 22 50 per barrel and a rate that we have expected to reach at the end of the planned period thanks to the efficiency of our investment which allow us to keep capex flat we generated a cash flow after capex of â 6 3 billion this excess cash fully cover more than twice our district distribution rate mid downstream contributed more than â 900 million of ebit and around â 1 billion of cash flow from operations gas power with â 544 million had its best performance since 2010 proving the competitiveness of midstream in capturing high value from lng where we increased our contracted volumes by 70 in particular retail gas contributed to these results with â 201 million thanks to greater operating efficiency the continuous growth of the customer base which now numbers 9 2 million clients 6 more than last year and thanks to an improved offer of new products refining marketing had a good performance notwithstanding the reduction by 23 of the refining margin ebit was driven by an excellent marketing performance with a result close to â 500 million while the refining system was impacted by the appreciation of sour crude due to the u s sanctions on here and the recent opec cut in versalis where we re very close to breakeven it was a difficult year due to the growth of cost of virgin naphtha by 25 the weaker euro dollar exchange rates and an excess of supply in the polyethylene market due to strong growth in middle east and u s export in 2018 eni improved its financial performance reaching its best result in the last 12 years eni s organic cash neutrality covered all cost of capex and full cash dividend of 52 per barrel an improvement of last year s results of 57 per barrel and on our target 55 per barrel even if we exclude the deferred cash in from zohr disposal our cash neutrality remained below 55 per barrel if we do take into account the net cash flow from portfolio activity we generated a free cash flow after portfolio and dividend of â 3 8 billion the highest since 2006 this has allowed us to lower our net debt to â 8 3 billion and to reduce the leverage to 16 and the gearing to 14 finally i would like to highlight the exceptional results we have reached in the years of industry downturn we have been able to reshape our business quickly so that today eni is more flexible faster more efficient and more valuable thanks to the large contribution from exploration success and the fast track development of our discovered resources 70 of the projects we sanctioned in the last 3 years came from the discovery of the last 5 years by leveraging the quality of our portfolio and the low cost development we have increased our production by 15 while reducing overall capex by around 35 the result of this is an improvement in organic cash generation and reduction in net debt the organic free cash flow now has reached â 6 5 billion more than double of what we had in 2014 with a brent price that was 30 higher and the net debt had dropped by 40 thank you and now together with our top management we are ready to answer your questions question and answer session operator the first question is from mr henry tarr from berenberg henry tarr could you potentially talk about the auctions on the exploration blocks one in the uae and the middle east when are you hoping to start drilling activities and perhaps if you could talk about the potential fiscal terms agreed for the blocks and how happy you are with the arrangements there and then secondly following the investment into the refinery in the uae are you now happy with the balance of the portfolio or do you think there s potentially more rebalancing to do as you look across the group claudio descalzi okay thank you luca can you answer for the exploration in middle east luca bertelli yes our plan is to start exploring in abu dhabi offshore next year so we had a plan for start drilling in second quarter 2020 and we ll follow up with a stream of exploration wells claudio descalzi so i think that you asked also if we are happy with the commercial contracts that we signed here we are happier the way we didn t sign it and it s clearly considering that it s not diluting our package of exploration initiatives it s not diluting our in the future our package of development so it s good conditions and clearly we have to be good also in exploring and finding resources for r m so i think that now we are really focused on this big initiative and big acquisition we made you know that we had plan on development already defined so we by 2022 we are going to increase our capacity from 900 million 900 000 barrels to 1 1 million barrels per day we are also improvement also in italy because we restart in est so our refinery in the north of italy we start also gela now so i think that it s going to be a good period for refinery if you ask if we are happy and now we think to we are in a good balance between upstream and downstream i think that now we improved our position clearly we don t have any other prone to losses we need something that we are going to see in an opportunistic way but considering that we are in the biggest refinery that has a lot of possible future development i think that we are happy with what we have now operator the next question is from mr rafal gutaj of bank of america merrill lynch rafal gutaj i ve got a few please first one just coming back to the adnoc downstream acquisition so when that transaction closes in the third quarter this year your leverage will likely go up by around 5 or so can you just illustrate what that might mean for the timing and level of additional shareholder returns over and above your current dividend strategy second question just in upstream you had a 100 million barrel write off could just give us a little bit of color around where that is and what are the assumptions underlining that reserve impairment and then finally jumping back to downstream just a bit of housekeeping on the milazzo refinery in the first quarter can you give us how long that refinery was out due to weather issues in the first quarter claudio descalzi about adnoc investment in the refinery i think the closing is expected by the third quarter so first of all it s not impacting in our capital allocation with respect to the our dividend policy or our return to investors so they are not incomplete because also we do acquisition now our leverage will be well below the 20 so from that point of view there is no problem massimo if you want to answer for the massimo mondazzi yes so the net write down that we made in the asset amounts substantially to â 470 million net of taxes more or less half of this value is due to the write down we are performing on junin 5 our heavy oil asset in venezuela because we have written down all the proved untapped resources reserve sorry due to the current situation in country so we have written down also the value so the issues relate to the difficulty to operate such asset in country right now so you remember we made the write down of cardã³n iv so the perla field in 2017 because of as we said uncertainties in country so the difficulties to inject additional money in venezuela today we are performing this write down because of the technical issue in country so the current production is going ahead while the development of the undeveloped reserves is difficult and that s the reason why we re doing so and the rest of the write downs relate to other assets and may relate to technical issues and a slight reduction in the scenario we re projecting looking forward claudio descalzi massimo mondazzi about milazzo really the long period of bad weather could do some problem in our south refineries not only milazzo but also in taranto because the bad weather was very long this was a rebalance that with the repositioning of our product coming from other depot and refinery and in milazzo especially in milazzo for a couple of weeks we had to slow down some plant but without any shutdown operator the next question is from mr alessandro pozzi of mediobanca alessandro pozzi i have two the first one is on adnoc and the refining unit it looks like it s going to have a meaningful contribution to your r m division just wondering if you could potentially quantify for us the impact on either earnings or cash flow the second question on the upstream gas realizations in the upstream have again been very strong just wondering if you can give us a bit more color there i was also wondering maybe if there is a lag between the oil price and gas realizations in the upstream claudio descalzi massimo you can answer it massimo mondazzi okay so as far as the return expected from adnoc refineries definitely we don t we can t be deterministic on this but some numbers have been spent even by the operator and the other partners in the initiative in the range of 10 at 10 yield from this investment and broadly speaking we can confirm definitely the cash flow expected from this investment would be a growing one as we said as claudio said we expect growth in our capacity in the refinery capacity up to 1 1 million so the return would be in line with this growth with an average that would be in the range of 10 to even slightly higher than 10 and the second question unidentified company representative realization of gas massimo mondazzi the realization of gas the realization of gas has been growing in 2018 taking into consideration the increase in the gas realization prices in europe when we sell the italian production and part of the libyan production so and the mix the change of the mix in our portfolio in terms of gas is contributing to this among the new project the gas project there in the production i would like to remember zohr and jangkrik definitely are increasing significantly the overall realization gas price in our portfolio alessandro pozzi so i believe the sensitivity of cash flow to the oil price has come down a little bit i guess that s a function of the new projects coming online massimo mondazzi yes exactly but you are right operator our next question is from mr alastair syme of citigroup alastair syme can i just ask what you think will be the sort of key final investment decisions you take in 2019 in the upstream and my follow up was just really on reserves eni has shown itself to be very different to the rest of the industry in terms of reserve replacement in recent years at the same time some of your peers say reserve life and reserve replacement doesn t really matter that much anymore i ll be interested in your perspective on how the strong reserve position gives you visibility on the future what you think of that comment claudio descalzi so clearly our position on the reserves replacement ratio is quite i don t know what they think of the other but it s really one of the main priorities because we our strategy is to grow organically so our strategy is to grow organically through exploration and be fast in developing our field so we reduced our inactive capital we have exploration so we start from our exploration that is around 1 per barrel unit cost so that is the only way to be able to keep and to travel over so exploration development that is the key and a key is to replace our reserves and our production now if you don t replace our production by organically you have to buy and if you have to buy you have to spend much more and that means that you reduce your cash flow your profit and that is not our business to reduce our profit our business is to increase so clearly the reserve replacement ratio is a key point is a clearly key point of our strategy for that reason we are investing in technology for that reason we are also so selective in finding good exploration prospects close to existing facilities in an area that we have already some operation or existing facilities also if not our facility to be able to go fast and the average now the average time to market that is 2 7 years that is 1 3 of the energy industry show that our focus is at the maximum so for the fid the fid that we think to put in production is a number then we would be more clear during our strategy presentation because if we talk about 2019 now we don t have anything to say in 1 month but we are going to deliver about between 7 and 9 new fids that with the aim really to replace more than replace our reserves alastair syme so claudio can i ask where you think the commercial resource base of the company is as distinct from sec reserves were you claudio descalzi can you repeat because francesco wants to talk was talking to me so i didn t follow you sorry alastair syme my question was where you think the size of the company s commercial resource base is as distinct from sec proven reserves claudio descalzi it s about â 14 billion i think yes yes that should be no it is a little bit more but okay we can say around between â 14 billion and â 15 billion if we can put the 2 periods there and clearly just to conclude what i was saying before the organic growth and the replacement of reserves is a matter of to be low cost and that is one of the reasons why we can keep our capex light that is the reason why also for the future they only said that they were the only disclosure i can do about the future is that really we can keep our capital flat because we are all our assets we are growing organically we can phase out and phase in new projects and that is really one of the reasons why we have been able to reduce our debt and to increase our free cash flow alastair syme and sorry just to follow up a clarification the â 14 billion to â 15 billion would be consistent with your scenario planning so you re based on sort of 70 oil something like that claudio descalzi yes exactly operator the next question is from mr jon rigby of ubs jonathon rigby sorry to labor the point on abu dhabi but can you just go through the how we should think this going forward and particularly in the context of the calculation of the indication you gave on profitability because i m a little puzzled because you talked about accounting for this in the associate line item so do you as we go forward unpack the associate structure to look at a sort of fully consolidated refining marketing business to calculate the breakeven or is that breakeven calculated on the basis of the dividend inflow that you re getting just to clarify please and then secondly i take your point slightly about not wanting to reveal everything about march 15 but just to think about the context in which you will speak on march 15 you ve talked about the 55 cash neutrality figure 52 achieved in 2018 there s a lot of moving parts with the disposals additions et cetera now obviously you ve increased the perimeter of the business with the abu dhabi acquisition so the way to think about it going into march would it be to think about whatever the moving parts end up is something in that 50 to 55 range is kind of where we should expect sort of eni s net performance to be claudio descalzi okay massimo answer the first question and the second massimo mondazzi hey jon technically you are right so the presentation will be accounted based on the equity method so you will see the results the 10 the 20 that we acquired and in the cash flow you will see the dividend so the number i mentioned before in the range of 10 in terms of yield reflected the dividend that is still part of the negotiation we put in place so how to structure the dividend policy of the company but let me say that this investment is a bit more than just an equity investment because we negotiated with adnoc for more than 1 year about the technical assessment of the refinery and the way forward about how to increase the capacity how to increase flexibility and the efficiency of this refinery so we definitely from a company point of view it is what it is but from a business point of view we really believe that our contribution would be much much higher and will be part of the decision taken in adnoc refinery and definitely we will give you every quarter significant information about the contribution of this investment to our full result so bridging from this answer to the following one relating to the cash neutrality definitely based on this respect we expect that the cash neutrality will take some advantage from this investment because definitely we are talking about the significant rebalancing in our refinery capacity we said 35 increase or more than this so definitely the key of this refinery is much much lower than the average that we have in italy basically in italy considering the historical asset base that we have but then this we have started positive contribution definitely we have moving parts as you said in our cash neutrality 55 in 2018 does not include any disposal contribution and we do not believe that even considering no contribution from disposal definitely we do not believe that our cash neutrality would be higher than 60 looking forward we believe that our cash neutrality will remain definitely below this number operator the next question is from mr michele della vigna of goldman sachs michele della vigna claudio one question when you took over as ceo in 2014 you had a strategic imperative to improve the business and geographical balance of eni and since then you ve materially grown the lng business refining biofuels you ve created as you highlight today a major business in the middle east you ve entered indonesia and mexico in scale is there any other part of your business that you think still needs to grow to provide a better balance and where you see attractive opportunities at the moment i m thinking particularly in areas like asia or north america claudio descalzi so we have to do i think that we did a lot and we did a lot very quickly and rapidly also because we have we had to fight the downturn and also because we had a good opportunity and as i said during the presentation we d be able to enter most of these new country thanks to the technology and the know how that we ve put in place middle east in middle east the gulf is not clearly not finished we just started so i think that we have to develop to continue to work and there are huge important opportunities to grow and rebalance further our portfolio and that area is quite important and it s important then from a contractual point of view from a good asset point of view from facility and maturity we are growing in asia so the gas in asia is another target we have indonesia we have australia that is growing and we have you have to remember that we have myanmar still and the exploration in vietnam so there are areas that in exploration especially on the gas side we grow and we have also we are drilling an important one in pakistan in north in the u s we are growing in alaska and that is an area where we are that s where we re increasing production and that is an additional target a known target for us and so it s not finished yet between that 3 we have to do much more to be able to be more resilient more balanced clearly all these effort is also based on our target to grow but looking at our carbon footprint so clearly we are working and from a technological point of view also to be able to grow but reducing our carbon footprint and clearly i think for the scope 1 to become carbon neutral that is another important important target so there are many things that are helping also to be more efficient more effective and also to have a better package to sell to the new country that we want to enter operator the next question is from miss irene himona of societe generale irene himona i have three questions please firstly in july you merged eni norge with point resources can you tell us the impact in 2018 on your cash flows and cash balances of that deal and perhaps remind us of the benefits you expect from this merger going forwards secondly could you talk a little bit about cost inflation pressures i mean i noticed from your disclosures the full year operating expense increased about 7 are you recruiting more people or is there wage inflation it would be helpful if you can clarify and then finally your full year capital expenditure was â 9 4 billion your net capex â 7 9 billion if you just remind us of the bridge or the components between those 2 numbers claudio descalzi okay hi irene so as far as your first question about the effect of vã r energi in 2018 i would say along the year or during the year in terms of cash flow economic terms the effect has been 0 because we deconsolidated eni norge and created from an accounting point of view vã r energi starting from the 31st of december so the only effect that we recorded are balance sheet effects and the balance sheet effect is being the deconsolidation of â 1 9 billion in terms of net capital invested and looking forward we expect definitely a positive contribution but in line with what we announced so a contribution to our cash neutrality decrease in the range of 2 per barrel the integration activities are going ahead as expected or even better than expected even from an industrial point of view and new discoveries has been announced the progress in that project will be the next fid are going ahead in line with expectations so far technically so good the capex split francesco s saying that page 15 in our press release you can see all the so capital expenditure there including investment â 9 3 million â 9 4 million net capex amounted to â 7 94 million and excluding the following items so the entry bonus paid in connection with the entry in the new concession in the emirates amounting to â 869 million and other non strategic acquisition in mid downstream businesses for approximately â 100 million so this is the reconciliation between the â 9 3 million and â 7 9 million okay and can answer about the inflection rate unidentified company representative okay in terms of inflection and cost environment for the upstream what we reckon through our market analysis is that offshore drilling rigs we see some signals of recovery of the price especially for the caps rigs around 5 while for the quarter activity the prices the rate the daily rate are still steady for the rest of the supplies like umbilical line pipeline and production system we reckon substantially steady prices and the same really also for turbo machinery in this moment there is still a substantial market oversupply while services for drilling we reckon a 3 cost increase so all in all there is no big i would say big changes in terms of cost inflation for the upstream costs q irene himona and in terms of your group operating expenses moving up during the year 7 is that linked to something specific is it wage inflation claudio descalzi no it is related to increased activity operator the next question is from mr peter low of redburn peter low the first is on refining marketing your green so your green throughput rebounded in the quarter which coincided with the stronger than expected result can you give any indication of the financial confirmation of those green refineries and perhaps how you see that developing moving forward second was just another quick one on venezuela obviously the situation is pretty fluid at the moment but can you give us an update on the operations there and the extent to which you may actually think you can recover any outstanding receivables claudio descalzi massimo massimo mondazzi if i understood well the question is the contribution of the green business okay in the last quarter we have a good margin of green product and the venice refinery increased the ebit and across the year with a good contribution of venice even if the capacity of the refinery is not so high in the next weeks we will start also with the gela refinery that more than double the capacity of green and the contribution will increase significantly claudio descalzi yes just if i can complete the answer about the green refinery so they are positive they are giving a positive contribution clearly we are still that we re using we start using through our technology second generation also third generation so something that is not palm oil so palm oil is something that has cost because there is the logistics so we have to imports so with the upgrade the we are doing looking for our green refinery we re using and that is our final target in second generation so cooking oil or waste material organic waste material that is going to reduce all the logistic cost and clearly there is no compete with food and it s going to increase drastically the already good performance of the green refinery antonio vella yes on venezuela the average production during 2018 was 48 the majority of the equity is coming from perla and then we have coral and junin the gas demand is lower than the capacity of our plant and we expect to have it lower also during 2019 however claudio descalzi the same range massimo mondazzi the same range yes however the availability of the plant is there in case of additional requirements we are ready to deliver more gas claudio descalzi okay so in terms of outstanding the outstanding at the end of the year was in the range of 700 million so more or less 100 million more than what we recorded at the end of 2017 so during the year we ve been paid in the range of 35 40 of total revenues that s definitely something more than expected at the end of 2018 we expect that the way we are recovering partially the revenues will continue in the future and what is much more important that the way we are recovering in euros outside united states is something that is not affected by the even the new us sanctions operator the next question is from biraj borkhataria of rbc biraj borkhataria i had a few on egypt could you just comment on where you are in the restart of the lng plant because it looks like this oil continues to surprise on the upside and then also just related to that can you walk us through the key deliverables in 2019 for the phase 2 of the project and then finally for massimo just a reminder can you guide us through a cash tax rate for 2019 claudio descalzi i m going to answer about the lng antonio is going to answer about the progress of the project and massimo the rest on the lng plant in egypt we have full participation in gas joint venture that we have ended at the present buys the lng and you know that of course that there is an ongoing there was an ongoing and there is still an ongoing litigation with the egyptian government the situation in the past months changed in particular for all the discoveries which were made and we are now and we have been in this past period in a framework where it is in the interest of all parties to have the plant restarted as soon as possible and the parties are discussing on that basis they have been discussing they re still discussing and once there is the interest of everybody you would expect that an agreement is found but of course the commercial discussion is ongoing antonio vella okay concerning the performance of our project at zohr we are producing currently as you know the 2 1 billion scf per day as a gross production and our equity is 672 million scf and the major achievement that we are working for 19 is train 5 6 and 7 completion so the first step of next grow is going to be 2 7 billion scf in july 6 months ahead of our schedule and then we re going to complete in september the lay down of the 30 inch subsea line to increase our additional production to 3 2 billion scf meaning that 980 million scf of equity so the gross production that we expect in 2019 is going to be 450 million barrels oil equivalent and in end of 2019 we re going to reach 580 million which is going to be in september so we are quite okay on our schedule and ahead of 6 months for all the projects in addition to that we have completed more or less the line that s connecting you remember el gamil for nooros production with abu madi and this is going to give us debottlenecking on pressure which we expect to grow up again on production of gas which will give us additional 200 million scf from the previous 1 billion so these are the plan for the 2019 in egypt moreover we are concluding our extension of concession on western desert in egypt and we expect to launch a large campaign of drilling on the oil discovery in south west meleiha and this will allow also to launch additional production on the western desert conclusion of now our negotiation is going to be more or less in couple of months and then we ll kick off all the activity there massimo mondazzi okay and as far as 2019 we expect cap cash tax rate in the range of 30 operator our next question is from massimo bonisoli of equita massimo mondazzi two quick questions left one on the very positive marketing result in r m division fourth quarter is usually a low season period could you give us some more details on this result and the second on versalis at the start of today the scenario forecast was for an operating profit of about â 300 million clearly this scenario was much different are there any operating issues also or it s only scenario related unidentified company representative okay about the marketing really in the last quarter of 2018 we had an exceptional performance even if this winter quarter is not really the best for the marketing result and this is due to the very good performance of the retailers especially the national retailer in italy but also in the retailer in other european countries germany austria and france especially and these in addition the result has been supported also to the increase in the rest of the world sale maintaining a good margin even if in the quarter the consumption are slightly decreasing claudio descalzi and massimo for the chemical side you there was a lot of good win in the first half of the year so unfortunately this didn t happen in the second half we are still very exposed in terms of polyethylene in terms of the cracker margins which in the second half of the year particularly with the spiking of naphtha returned to the level of being very uncompetitive in europe compared to middle east and u s particularly so we didn t have really any issues on the operating side in fact the fact that we are less maintenance and good operational facilities helped us in mitigating some of the second half but unfortunately with the portfolio that we have today and continue to try and to diversify and develop we are still in the situation where the scenario had a big effect in the second half operator mr descalzi that was the final question i will turn the conference back to you sir for any additional comments claudio descalzi okay thank you very much and good afternoon operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining the conference is now over and you may disconnect your telephones

the us shales continued to grow in 2018 following the previous year s strong recovery while drilling activity in canada was affected at the end of the year by the drop in oil prices for 2019 following the recent reset of oil prices us drilling activity is expected to be stable while in canada drilling activity is expected to be well below the level of last year in latin america a recovery in drilling activity in mexico is expected as the new government makes more funds available for pemex and private operators begin implementing their energy reform commitments in the rest of the regions drilling activity is expected to be relatively stable with shale drilling activity in argentina likely to switch from gas to oil in the eastern hemisphere drilling activity is expected to continue a gradual recovery with a focus on gas developments after our strong performance in 2018 we expect to consolidate our sales and margins through the year with sales and margins in line with those of the second half of 2018 we should benefit from growing sales of premium connection products for offshore projects around the world and the inclusion of consolidated revenues from our new operation in saudi arabia but we will not repeat the exceptional level of offshore line pipe shipments to the eastern mediterranean and will have lower sales in canada with a stable level of sales and limited

states canada and mexico in south america sales increased due to higher sales of octg products in the andean region and higher sales of line pipe in argentina in europe sales remained stable across the region and for the different products in the middle east and africa sales increased significantly as we completed deliveries of zohr s offshore line pipe in the east mediterranean in asia pacific we had stable sales operating income from tubular products and services amounted to 154 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 233 million in the previous quarter and 150 million in the

quarter and 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the loss during the quarter corresponds mainly to the effect of an 8 6 appreciation of the argentine peso on net fiscal trade and financial

the residual useful life of maverick s tubes segment customer relationships on the other hand we recorded a charge of 19 million due to the effect on the tax base used to calculate deferred taxes of

selling prices sales increased mainly due to a strong increase in demand in the united states and canada and higher sales of line pipe for complex projects including shipments for the second zohr offshore welded pipeline in egypt in north america sales increased mainly due to higher demand of octg and line pipe and the consolidation of our market position throughout the region in south america

the us shales continued to grow in 2018 following the previous year s strong recovery while drilling activity in canada was affected at the end of the year by the drop in oil prices for 2019 following the recent reset of oil prices us drilling activity is expected to be stable while in canada drilling activity is expected to be well below the level of last year in latin america a recovery in drilling activity in mexico is expected as the new government makes more funds available for pemex and private operators begin implementing their energy reform commitments in the rest of the regions drilling activity is expected to be relatively stable with shale drilling activity in argentina likely to switch from gas to oil in the eastern hemisphere drilling activity is expected to continue a gradual recovery with a focus on gas developments after our strong performance in 2018 we expect to consolidate our sales and margins through the year with sales and margins in line with those of the second half of 2018 we should benefit from growing sales of premium connection products for offshore projects around the world and the inclusion of consolidated revenues from our new operation in saudi arabia but we will not repeat the exceptional level of offshore line pipe shipments to the eastern mediterranean and will have lower sales in canada with a stable level of sales and limited

we had stable sales operating income from tubular products and services amounted to 154 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 233 million in the previous quarter and 150 million in the

bullard gordin grouse kane berman majozi rw johnson straight talk singapore revisited wsm politics this budget will not transform economy cosatu federation says there is no clear strategy to help stimulate growth and regenerate our economy cosatu statement on government s 2019 20 budget speech 20 february 2019 cosatu has noted the 2019 20 budget as presented by the minister of finance tito mboweni this budget comes at a time when many households continue to struggle to absorb the escalating living costs since the last year s vat hike last year s vat hike found many low income households already in a very severe economic crisis over the past five years unemployment has been getting worse out of the 9 2 million south africans that are unemployed about 8 3 million of them are black the expanded unemployment rate for black south africans is 41 about 12 1 million black south african workers support 45 7 million persons who live in 13 5 million households according to stats sa 13 8 million people live below the food poverty line and 30 4 million live below the upper bound poverty line for black south africans around 29 million live below the upper bound poverty line this budget has no plan to extricate many of these people from the jaws of poverty it is also obvious that there is no plan to wean people off social grants because this budget will not transform the economy and the low baseline wage regime that has kept many people dependent on government there is nothing in the budget that will provide the possibility to change the outcomes of our economic development trajectory there is no clear strategy to help stimulate growth and regenerate our economy this will leave more people isolated from the mainstream economy and still dependent on the government for their survival the survivalist informal economy that feeds and clothes many families has again been abandoned in this underwhelming budget in short cosatu believes that government did not rise to the occasion this was a missed opportunity to stabilise the state save the soes grow the economy and create jobs growing the economy protecting and creating jobs it is obvious that the overreliance on foreign direct investment continues the minister barely touched on how the government will ensure that the investment and job summits targets will be met he did not even mention how many jobs have been created or will be created less than 6 departments have tabled job creation targets in the 2019 budget and most of these are in fact epwp programmes this is despite thousands of jobs being lost since the summits were held cosatu acknowledges the partial successes of the jobs fund and industrial business incentives however we had hoped to hear from the minister what the government would do to take the economy from 1 to 3 economic growth we had hoped to hear from the minister that he would ensure the reserve bank emphasises both protecting and creating jobs and growing the economy in addition to protecting workers from inflation in its work revenue cosatu appreciates that the state cannot tax its way out of the crisis however we believe this budget misses several key interventions that could address the revenue and expenditure crises we believe that there is still a space to increase company tax from 28 to 30 without spooking investors equally there is space to increase personal income tax for those earning above r1 5 million per annum there is also a need to increase inheritance and estate duty taxes for the wealthy we had hoped to hear from the minister measures to close tax loopholes for the rich it is not helpful for the government to continue squeezing workers meagre salaries by not adjusting tax brackets for inflation this is merely an income tax hike on workers through the back door in short workers small increases will go to inflation and sars the government should focus on dealing with tax evasion by the rich and business cosatu urges the government to rapidly introduce the levy on the exporting of scrap metal this is critical to growing local industry cosatu is disappointed that the government is happy to announce the carbon tax and an increase in the sugar beverages tax but has abandoned its just transition commitments to protect vulnerable workers jobs in those sectors we are pleased to see sars beginning to be restored to its stable position we welcome the re establishment of the illicit trade enforcement unit it must tackle both the explosion of illicit tobacco and the flood of illegal imports in particular clothing and cars vat cosatu welcomes the exemption from vat of flour and sanitary pads but given the escalating tax and tariff hikes and inflation decimating the salaries of workers and the poor we had hoped the minister would table something meaningful cosatu is calling upon the government to urgently increase the allocation of free water and electricity to indigent households this will help protect the poor from the brunt of the vat and other anti poor hikes fuel levy cosatu is deeply concerned by the lack of urgency in government to deal with the ballooning of the raf s deficit from r241 billion in 2019 to a projected r400 billion in 2021 increasing the fuel levy to deal with this will only make transport and consumer goods more expensive and further squeeze the economy the solution is in passing the raf and road accident benefit scheme bills by parliament these will help ensure raf money goes to road accident victims and not lawyers and that there is a more equitable distribution of benefits we welcome treasury s commitment to now support these bills expenditure cosatu acknowledges the need for government expenditure to be sustainable we are worried that government debt levels are rising at dangerous rates and lack credibility the federation does not believe that expenditure and debt management need to be achieved through austerity the auditor general estimates that up to 10 or r150 billion is lost every year to corruption wasteful expenditure and rollovers billions are allocated for catering even in the 2019 budget the government needs to learn to manage workers hard earned taxes better it does not make sense to spend r13 billion on four departmental head offices tshwane council head office and the south african consulate in new york yet on the one be blaming nurses and teachers for wanting to be paid enough to buy their children food we had hoped to hear a clear plan from the minister on how the government will reduce corruption and wasteful expenditure and recover stolen funds cosatu applauds the projected r526 billion in infrastructure we need to hear more from the government on measures to prevent it from falling into the hands of looters more needs to be done by the chief procurement officer to save costs through central and transparent procurement processes the public procurement bill must be fast tracked and prioritised at all costs so that we can use local procurement as a way of growing the economy the government needs to end outsourcing in particular at correctional services where everything has become a looting frenzy and also has been shown to be more expensive than insourcing public sector wage bill cosatu welcomes the freezing of cabinet members salaries and below inflation increases for senior management they are after all the ones who have mismanaged the state however these do not go far enough national and provincial cabinets and mayoral committees can easily be cut by 50 they should equally accept 25 salary cuts the salaries and benefits of soe executives must be capped to the levels of the public service it cannot be acceptable to pay soe managers salaries of r8 million while making many doctors work 48 hour shifts due to frozen posts we urge the government to release the soe shareholder management bill and to place all public sector entities and companies under the public service collective bargaining council this will help stabilise public spending reduce the growing wage gap protect low paid soe workers and reduce exorbitant management salaries cosatu is pleased that according to the budget tabled the public sector wage bill is in fact stable appropriate and in line with international norms at 35 this is in spite of the minister s inflammatory and misleading rhetoric about it threatening the state s survival however the government does not assist anyone by negotiating in parliament instead of using the appropriate platforms if it wants stable labour relations then it must engage workers about their conditions it cannot announce unilateral changes to performance and overtime pay matters that are governed by law and not engage workers at the pscbc this will push workers to strike to protect their rights government is obliged to pay overtime and provide time off when workers work overtime yet they are now providing neither to traffic police and yet they are forcing them to work overtime this will only further exacerbate our high levels of corruption road lawlessness and deaths whilst government is boasting about the declining numbers of public servants it fails to mention how this is resulting in long queues at hospitals and home affairs rising teacher learner ratios in classes declining policing levels etc the government needs to reduce the bloated cabinet and executive structures and not reduce and overwork service delivery workers equally government and municipalities need to stop outsourcing permanent functions to epwp programmes it cannot be justified to employ firefighters and pay them epwp rates of r80 per day cosatu s welcomes the government s commitment to fill healthcare posts the public service vacancy levels are approximately 140 000 currently and critical service delivery posts in health education police need to be filled urgently state owned enterprises soes cosatu welcomes the additional funding allocation of r23 billion per annum over the mtef to help stabilise eskom workers and the economy cannot afford for eskom to collapse the government needs to assure workers that eskom and the soes will not be privatised and that workers will not be retrenched if head counts are too high in one workplace then those workers must be retrained and redeployed to other soes or government departments where there is a shortage of workers no worker must be retrenched and new industries must be developed to ensure no workers are left unemployed solar panel and water conservation factories must be created in mpumalanga and limpopo as the economy transitions from the carbon economy eskom and the other soes can and must be saved comprehensive forensic audits must be instituted the bleeding stopped stolen funds recovered incompetent managers fired and new funding and operational plans put in place these must be discussed with the affected workers eskom must be saved from the unaffordable ipp contracts where it is obliged to buy electricity from ipps at a higher rate than it sells them eskom must be allowed to produce renewable energy itself the department of energy needs to resuscitate its solar panel rollout the programme to indigent households to help make electricity affordable to them and to ensure those panels are locally made eskom tariffs must be made affordable to workers and industry as well as neighbouring states dti must work with the auto manufacturing sector to produce electric vehicles like these will help secure and increase electricity demand cosatu is not convinced unbundling will address ballooning management costs in fact we fear it will make things worse we welcome the government s plans to ensure tighter oversight over the soes we worry that there is still no plan to stabilise and reduce eskom s crisis debt levels cosatu equally worries that there is no clear plan to stabilise and save sabc prasa denel and petrosa the government needs to explain what state assets it wants to sell because cosatu won t support the privatisation of soes the government needs to explain what it means by allowing equity partners on board departments law enforcement cosatu is disappointed by the lack of an anti corruption plan in the budget we are pleased though with saps commitment to recruiting 3000 new officers per annum however more needs to be done to shift saps officers from desk duty to visible and other forms of policing it is immoral that the government allocates more to bodyguards for politicians r3 billion than it does for land reform we had hoped to hear from the government on its plans to reduce the labour and other court backlogs cosatu welcomes the increased funding for legal aid for the poor the government needs to explain its plans to clean up the intelligence services and the mass looting that is alleged to have happened there health care and social development we welcome the filling of medical positions and the increased allocations towards the nhi more needs to be done to arrest the collapse of public healthcare in particular its infrastructure without the provincial management of public hospitals nhi will never happen transport cosatu is shocked that no plan was tabled to stem the collapse of metro rail in fact there is an intention by prasa to decrease infrastructure expenditure public transport is critical to economic growth yet the government has no public transport plan it is amazing that ministers mboweni and nzimande are sticking to e tolls despite its rejection and collapse we applaud the termination of the cps looting of sassa this has confirmed cosatu s stance that outsourcing is unaffordable and is looting with a high school certificate water sanitation and housing the department of water and sanitation has effectively collapsed south africa is in a water crisis the giyani project has ballooned from r40 million to r4 billion yet the budget offers no plan and minister mokonyane remains a cabinet member cosatu welcomes the allocations for upgrading informal settlements and support for the missing middle to acquire homes education cosatu applauds the government s increased funding for free tertiary education we welcome the allocations to address the school infrastructure and sanitation crises clear dates and targets are needed for the government to be believable public works needs to be woken from its deep slumber to ensure learner and workers are safe in schools and public buildings local government the ag estimates 90 of municipalities are in severe financial distress yet the budget offers no plan to arrest this all those workers have seen is their jobs outsourced to epwp labour cosatu welcomes the increased funding for the ccma to help ensure workers rights are protected including not to be paid less than the national minimum wage more funding is needed to hire labour inspectors to ensure employers abide by all labour health and safety laws public investment corporation amendment bill cosatu has long championed the pic bill as a key anti corruption tool to tackle corruption in the pic to ensure accountability and transparency provide for worker representation on its board and to set progressive investment guidelines minister mboweni continues to resist this we had hoped he would have seen the light and announce he will now support this anti corruption and pro workers bill and supported its passage by parliament before the 2019 elections issued by sizwe pamla national spokesperson cosatu 20 february 2019

2018 were 1 111 0 million up 16 1 million from 2017 the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume at essakane 13 1 million and a higher realized gold price 7 8 million partially offset by lower sales volume at rosebel 2 2 million and westwood 1 2 million revenues for the fourth quarter 2018 were 274 3 million down 16 8 million or 6 from the same prior year period the decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume at westwood 12 1 million and essakane 12 1 million and a lower realized gold price 9 7 million partially offset by higher sales volume at rosebel 17 4 million cost of sales for 2018 was 974 1 million up 32 1 million from 2017 the increase was due to higher operating costs 29 9 million and higher royalties 2 2 million operating costs were higher primarily due to higher energy costs increased maintenance costs at essakane and rosebel increased contractor costs resulting from higher mine production at essakane and a weaker u s dollar relative to the euro partially offset by higher capitalized stripping at essakane cost of sales for the fourth quarter 2018 was 250 3 million consistent with the same prior year period higher operating costs 4 2 million and higher royalties 0 1 million were offset by lower depreciation expense 4 0 million operating costs were higher primarily due to higher energy costs increased preventative maintenance at essakane and rosebel and increased contractor costs resulting from higher mine production at essakane partially offset by a stronger u s dollar relative to the euro and the canadian dollar depreciation expense for 2018 was 265 4 million unchanged from the prior year as the impact of reserve increases at essakane and rosebel was offset by higher depreciation of capitalized stripping at rosebel depreciation expense for the fourth quarter 2018 was 64 2 million down 4 0 million or 6 from the same prior year period the decrease was primarily due to an increase in reserves at essakane and rosebel income tax expense for 2018 was 38 0 million down 59 6 million 2017 income tax expense for 2018 comprised current income tax expense of 45 1 million 2017 59 7 million and deferred income tax recovery of 7 1 million 2017 expense of 37 9 million the decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to changes to deferred income tax assets and liabilities differences in the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange and differences in the level of taxable income in our operating jurisdictions from one period to the next net loss attributable to equity holders for 2018 was 28 2 million or 0 06 per share compared to net earnings of 501 6 million or 1 08 per share in the prior year the decrease was primarily due to reversals of impairment charges related to the côté gold project and the rosebel mine in

same prior year period net cash from operating activities for 2018 was 191 1 million down 104 2 million from the prior year the decrease was primarily due to changes in movements in non cash working capital items and non current ore stockpiles 98 6 million and lower earnings after non cash adjustments 26 3 million partially offset by lower income taxes paid 11 1 million and higher net settlement of derivatives 9 5 million the change in movements in non cash working capital items and non current ore stockpiles 98 6 million was primarily due to higher mine supplies 45 5 million build up of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the prior year 22 0 million higher stockpiling of low grade ore 17 6 million and increased value added tax recoverable at essakane 9 5 million the increase in mine supplies resulted from initiatives to optimize inventory levels increase equipment availability and lower maintenance costs including a strategic decision to re manufacture parts in house as opposed to outsourcing the benefit of these mine supplies initiatives are at the early stages of being realised ore stockpiles were higher as a result of planned increases in ore production at rosebel and essakane and a build of heap leach ore stockpiles at essakane net cash from operating activities for the fourth quarter 2018 was 23 1 million down 42 1 million from the same prior year period net

offset by cash generated from operating activities 191 1 million and proceeds received from sumitomo metal mining co ltd pursuant to the sale of a 30 interest in the côté gold project in the second quarter 2017 95 0 million working capital as of december 31 2018 was 859 7 million down 70 2 million compared to december 31 2017 the decrease was due to lower current assets 74 1 million partially

production from essakane 16 000 ounces and the continued development at westwood 4 000 ounces were offset by lower production at rosebel 15 000 ounces and the joint ventures 5 000 ounces attributable gold production inclusive of joint venture operations was 231 000 ounces for the fourth quarter 2018 up 3 000 ounces from the same prior year period the increase was primarily due to higher head

attributable gold production of 103 000 ounces in the fourth quarter and 405 000 ounces for the year ended 2018 were higher by 1 and 4 respectively compared to the same prior year periods as ore feed was sourced from higher grade zones the impact of higher grades was partially offset by lower throughput realized due to coarser mill feed and lower mill availability due to maintenance on the crushing and grinding circuit mine production for the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 was higher compared to the same prior year periods due to increased equipment availability combined with the utilization of contractors to meet production targets essakane has implemented a new in house equipment maintenance program with the goal of increasing equipment availability increasing mining volumes and lowering maintenance costs essakane has also purchased additional mining equipment to further increase mine production and reduce reliance on mining contractors thereby reducing operating costs ore mined for the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 was higher compared to the same prior year periods as the mine continued through ore zones and stockpiled lower grade heap leach ore cost of sales per ounce sold was 763 for the fourth quarter 2018 and 762 for the full year lower by 4 and 3 respectively compared to the same prior year periods largely as a result of higher capitalized waste stripping in the fourth quarter 2018 essakane continued to face cost pressures with rising energy costs which were partially mitigated by the supply of energy from the solar plant and our hedging program operating costs were higher due to the utilization of contractors and higher planned maintenance reliance on contractors is expected to decline in future periods as essakane will receive new mining equipment in 2019 similarly maintenance costs are expected to decline over time as essakane transitions its maintenance in house to increase equipment availability despite these cost pressures year over year cost of sales per ounce sold for 2018 was lower primarily due to higher capitalized stripping and higher sales volume in addition a weaker u s dollar relative to the euro contributed to higher costs for the year total cash costs per ounce produced were 723 for the fourth quarter 2018 and 718 for the full year higher by 1 and lower by 3 respectively compared to the same prior year periods in the fourth quarter 2018 iamgold faced cost pressures such as rising energy costs higher contractor costs and higher maintenance costs but benefited from higher gold production and higher capitalized waste stripping year over year total cash costs were lower primarily due to higher capitalized waste stripping and higher production volume these benefits were partially offset by the increasing cost pressures noted above along with a weaker u s dollar relative to the euro included in total cash costs for the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 was the impact of realized derivative gains from hedging programs of 9 and 17 per ounce produced respectively 2017 12 and 5 all in sustaining costs per ounce sold were 1 114 for the fourth quarter and 1 002 for the full year higher by 13 and 5 respectively compared to the same prior year periods the increases were primarily due to higher sustaining capital expenditures partially offset by lower cost of sales per ounce included in total cash costs and all in sustaining costs for the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 was the impact of realized derivative gains from hedging programs of 10 and 19 per ounce sold respectively 2017 14 and 6 outlook iamgold expects attributable production at essakane in 2019 to be in the range of 375 000 to 390 000 ounces essakane will continue to optimize production lower unit costs and increase mine and mill efficiencies at higher proportions of hard rock through multiple optimization initiatives essakane is targeting higher fleet availability through a planned maintenance initiative designed to support an increase in mining volumes coupled with lower overall maintenance costs essakane is pursuing a mill upgrade plan with a series of improvements designed to expand mill capacity by increasing crusher throughput and optimizing liner configurations supported by the commissioning of the oxygen plant essakane is expected to improve recoveries through enhanced gold extraction with lower cyanide consumption while also reducing the negative impacts experienced when processing graphitic ore these initiatives are designed to deliver on the 2019 production and cost targets and position essakane to realize upside potential by expanding production and pursuing additional resources at satellite deposits with the potential to add to the mine life a feasibility study is expected to be completed in the second quarter 2019 outlining opportunities to further optimize the carbon in leach circuit in addition to the future potential of heap leaching at essakane for 2019 we have allocated capital to a mill de bottlenecking project to increase cil plant throughput to 13 5 million tonnes per annum at 100 hard rock which is significantly higher than the current capacity of 12 million tonnes per annum at 100 hard rock the original nameplate capacity of the plant was 10 8 million tonnes per annum at 100 hard rock in 2019 regional exploration is expected to continue on prospective targets with the objective of increasing soft rock resources in close proximity to enhance mill feed rosebel mine suriname iamgold interest 95 attributable gold production of 85 000 ounces in the fourth quarter 2018 and 287 000 ounces for the full year were 8 higher and 5 lower compared to the same prior year periods for the quarter the difference was primarily due to higher head grades and recoveries partially offset by lower throughput grades for the quarter increased compared to earlier in the year as the mine sequenced into higher grade zones as part of the mine plan throughput was lower as the ore feed increased to 85 hard and transition rock compared to 64 in the prior year period throughput was also marginally impacted by a two day unlawful work stoppage year over year attributable gold production was lower primarily due to lower throughput due to higher planned maintenance cost of sales per ounce sold was 856 for the fourth quarter and 857 for the year ended 2018 higher by 12 and 14 respectively compared to the same prior year periods rosebel faced rising energy costs and increased preventative maintenance costs combined with local labour cost increases following the finalization of the collective labour agreement in the third quarter 2018 in addition rosebel had lower capitalized waste stripping the fourth quarter 2018 benefited from higher sales volume total cash costs per ounce produced were 774 for the fourth quarter and 831 for the year ended 2018 higher by 11 and 16 respectively compared to the same prior year periods due to the cost pressures noted above included in total cash costs for the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 was the impact of realized derivative gains from hedging programs of 4 and 8 per ounce produced respectively 2017 nil and nil all in sustaining costs per ounce sold were 981 for the fourth quarter and 1 006 for the year ended 2018 for the quarter costs were 4 lower compared to the same prior year period primarily due to lower sustaining capital expenditures partially offset by higher cost of sales per ounce year over year costs were 8 higher primarily due to higher cost of sales per ounce and higher sustaining capital expenditures included in all in sustaining costs for the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 was the impact of realized derivative gains from hedging programs of 4 and 8 per ounce sold respectively 2017 nil and nil outlook we expect attributable production at rosebel in 2019 to be in the range of 315 000 to 330 000 ounces rosebel will continue to undertake strategic pit pushbacks on the rosebel concession unlocking higher grade ore zones while pursuing mill improvements to increase recoveries including the addition of a carbon in column plant at the tailings management facility and revisions to the sag mill liner while mill throughput in 2019 is expected to be at levels consistent with 2018 head grades are expected to improve benefiting from the commencement of ore deliveries from the saramacca deposit in the second half of the year construction will continue on the 18 kilometre haul road linking the saramacca deposit to the rosebel mill with targeted completion by mid 2019 infrastructure construction is expected to commence in the second quarter 2019 rosebel is also conducting a scoping study to evaluate the underground mining potential of saramacca which could substantially lower waste volumes thereby reducing costs saprolite mining in the initial years is expected to continue as planned with future potential for underground mining once hard rock is reached in 2019 rosebel is conducting a study on enhancing the mill design by running an open circuit sag mill combined with a secondary pebble crusher to enhance hard rock throughput and increase gold production westwood mine canada iamgold interest 100 gold production was 28 000 ounces for the fourth quarter 2018 3 lower than the same prior year period primarily due to lower head grades gold production for 2018 was 129 000 ounces or 3 higher than the prior year primarily due to higher throughput partially offset by lower head grades the lower grades reflected mining activity that sequenced through lower grade stopes as part of the mine plan head grade excluding marginal ore for the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 was 6 78 g t au and 7 16 g t au respectively 2017 8 01 g t au and 7 80 g t au the mine continues its strategy of utilizing excess mill capacity by custom milling ore batches from neighbouring mine sites underground development for the year ended 2018 was 10 600 metres averaging 29 metres per day and comprised 10 100 metres of lateral development and 500 metres of vertical development underground development continued in the fourth quarter 2018 to open up access to new mining areas with lateral development of approximately 2 500 metres averaging 27 metres per day during the quarter development continued to focus on the ramp breakthrough on level 132 while respecting safety protocols in place for mining in areas where seismicity is present in line with this protocol three units of bolting equipment which are designed to manage seismic exposure were received during the quarter infrastructure development continued in future development blocks at lower levels cost of sales per ounce sold of 1 086 and total cash costs per ounce produced of 1 102 for the fourth quarter 2018 were both higher by 19 compared to the same prior year period primarily due to lower sales and production volumes higher mine production and labour cost increases following the finalization of the collective labour agreement in the third quarter 2018 partially offset by a stronger u s dollar relative to the canadian dollar cost of sales per ounce sold of 886 and total cash costs per ounce produced of 884 for 2018 were higher compared to the prior year by 5 and 7 respectively primarily due to higher mine production and labour cost increases following the finalization of the collective labour agreement in the third quarter 2018 included in total cash costs for the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 was the impact of realized derivative gains from currency hedging programs of nil and 4 per ounce produced respectively 2017 12 and 7 all in sustaining costs per ounce sold of 1 334 for the fourth quarter and 1 073 for the year ended 2018 were higher compared to the same prior year periods by 31 and 10 respectively primarily due to higher cost of sales per ounce and higher sustaining capital expenditures included in all in sustaining costs for the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 was the impact of realized derivative gains and losses from currency hedging programs of 1 loss and 5 gain per ounce sold respectively 2017 17 gain and 12 gain outlook we expect production at westwood in 2019 to be in the range of 100 000 to 120 000 ounces as mining and development activities continue to progress in maintaining safety protocols westwood is expecting to commission additional equipment in 2019 capable of operating remotely in areas with challenging ground conditions production is expected primarily from two of the six planned mining blocks with production expected to commence midyear from block three which is deeper in the mine with a strategic focus to progress development activities in the production and expansion blocks we expect to deliver on our 2019 production and cost targets while providing achievable guidance for progression to full production sadiola mine mali iamgold interest 41 attributable gold production of 14 000 ounces for the fourth quarter and 59 000 ounces for year ended 2018 was lower by 22 and 6 respectively compared to the same prior year periods primarily due to lower head grades as a result of greater drawdowns of marginal ore stockpiles total cash costs per ounce produced of 866 for the fourth quarter 2018 were lower compared to the same prior year period as a result of lower mining costs and greater utilization of marginal stockpiles due to the cessation of mining activity in the second quarter 2018 total cash costs per ounce produced of 925 for the year ended 2018 were higher compared to the prior year as a result of lower gold production all in sustaining costs per ounce sold of 871 for the fourth quarter and 930 for year ended 2018 were lower compared to the same prior

index held near a four month high on suggestions from u s president donald trump that he could extend the march 1 deadline to raise tariffs on chinese imports in canada tsx futures were lower as crude prices pulled back from recent highs on concerns about rising u s shale oil output if we move into next week without a deal or some form of extension then investors will start to get nervous but for now the optimistic case appears to hold sway chris beauchamp chief market analyst at ig said the signs of trade war damage are there to see exemplified by japan s dire export figures and this should help focus minds in the bid to get a deal done a new report showed japan s exports fell 13 per cent in january and that country s trade deficit high the highest in 13 years with a quiet day on tap in terms of economic news he added indexes could struggle for direction although the most recent minutes from the u s federal reserve set to be released wednesday afternoon could offer some clues whether discussions at the last meeting align with the fed s more dovish tone seen since late last year on u s china trade high level talks resumed this week in washington on tuesday mr trump said the march 1

from supply cuts led by opec oanda analyst dean popplewell said crude bears expect opec member and top crude exporter saudi arabia to reduce shipments of light crude oil to asia next month as part of the effort to tighten markets because of the cuts crude bulls expect brent to average 73 per barrel and wti to average 66 by year end however he added that the opec supply cut is coming up against higher u s crude output which surged by more than 2 million barrels a day in 2018 to a record 11 9 million as a result of booming shale oil production he also noted that in a report released tuesday

at walker crips investment management said british supermarket chain sainsbury s and swedish lender swedbank marred the positive picture overall sainsbury s shares sank 18 5 per cent after britain s

orders for machinery goods fell sharply the japanese market largely shrugged off the weak trade data which showed that exports fell 8 4 per cent from a year earlier focusing instead on improved prospects of a us china trade deal that could boost equity markets there are concerns about japan s falling exports but to investors who haven t caught up with the recent rally in japanese stocks there is a risk that they will fall behind the market s further rise if the trade talks go well said hiroyuki ueno a senior strategist at sumitomo mitsui trust asset management toyota motor rose 1 4

meeting minutes link federal reserve officials widely favoured ending the runoff of the central bank s balance sheet this year while expressing uncertainty over whether they would raise interest rates again in 2019 minutes of their january meeting showed many participants suggested that it was not yet clear what adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate later this year according to the official record of the fed s most recent policy meeting several of these participants argued that rate increases might prove necessary only if inflation outcomes were higher than in their baseline outlook the us central bank caught markets off guard last month by suspending a three year campaign to raise interest rates saying it would be patient about making any adjustments to its target range for short term interest rates now at between 2 25 per cent and 2 5 per cent it also signalled it may slow or end reductions to its us4 trillion balance sheet a process it had previously characterised as being on automatic pilot baml on the australian rates there are some tentative reasons for the reserve bank of australia rba to feel a little more comfortable with

information and are available free of charge by calling toll free at 1 800 621 1675 or visiting www ftportfolios com a prospectus should be read carefully before investing past performance is no assurance of future results investment return and market value of an investment in a fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost principal risk factors a fund s shares will change in value and you could lose money by investing in a fund an investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency there can be no assurance that a fund s investment objectives will be achieved an investment in a fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges the risks of investing in each fund are spelled out in its prospectus shareholder report and other regulatory filings an index etf seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield of an index you should anticipate that the value of an index fund s shares will decline more or less in correlation with any decline in the value of the index an index fund s return may not match the return of the index unlike a fund the indices do not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore do not incur the expenses incurred by a fund investors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share s net asset value shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account however unlike mutual funds shares may only be redeemed directly from the fund by authorized participants in very large creation redemption units if the fund s authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem fund shares may trade at a discount to the fund s net asset value and possibly face delisting one of the principal risks of investing in a fund is market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a fund fund shares or securities in general may fall in value an actively managed etf is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio in managing such a fund s investment portfolio the portfolio managers management teams advisor or sub advisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result a fund that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks including limited diversification an investment in a fund concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically certain funds may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger more established companies an investment in a fund containing securities of non u s issuers is subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations political risks withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting non u s issuers these risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in or with significant operations in emerging market countries a fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market investments in sovereign bonds involve special risks because the governmental authority that controls the repayment of the debt may be unwilling or unable to repay the principal and or interest when due in times of economic uncertainty the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligations preferred securities high yield securities corporate bonds government bonds municipal bonds and senior loans are subject to credit risk call risk income risk interest rate risk inflation risk and prepayment risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest and or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result credit risk is heightened for floating rate loans and high yield securities call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher yielding debt instruments held by a fund performance could be adversely impacted income risk is the risk that income from a fund s fixed income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed income securities in a fund will decline because of rising market interest rates inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected this may result in a decline in a fund s income senior floating rate loans are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated as a result the risks associated with these loans are similar to the risks of high yield fixed income instruments high yield securities or junk bonds are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings and therefore may be highly speculative these securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history narrowly focused operations and or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity the market for high yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities income from municipal bonds held by a fund could be declared taxable because of among other things unfavorable changes in tax laws adverse interpretations by the internal revenue service or state tax authorities or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer convertible securities have characteristics of both equity and debt securities and as a result are exposed to certain additional risks the values of certain synthetic convertible securities will respond differently to market fluctuations than a traditional convertible security because such synthetic convertibles are composed of two or more separate securities or instruments each with its own market value a fund is subject to the credit risk associated with the counterparty creating the synthetic convertible instrument synthetic convertible securities may also be subject to the risks associated with derivatives exchange traded notes etns are senior unsecured unsubordinated debt securities whose returns are linked to the performance of a particular market benchmark or strategy minus applicable fees the value of an etn may be influenced by various factors real estate investment trusts reits and real estate operating companies reocs are subject to certain risks including changes in the real estate market vacancy rates and competition volatile interest rates and economic recession master limited partnerships mlps are subject to certain risks including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics energy conservation taxes price controls and other regulatory policies of various governments in addition there is the risk that a mlp could be taxed as a corporation resulting in decreased returns from such mlp the use of futures options and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset index or rate which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives these risks are heightened when a fund s portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance a fund s return or as a substitute for a position or security rather than solely to hedge or offset the risk of a position or security held by a fund a fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash rather than in kind securities as a result an investment in a fund may be less tax efficient than an investment in an exchange traded fund that effects its creations and redemptions for in kind securities a fund s investment in repurchase agreements may be subject to market and credit risk with respect to the collateral securing the repurchase agreements alternative investments may employ complex strategies have unique investment and risk characteristics and may not be suitable for all investors certain funds may invest in other investment companies including closed end funds cefs etfs and affiliated etfs which involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds in addition a fund s investment performance and risks may be related to the investment and performance of the underlying funds a fund may invest in u s government obligations u s treasury obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government securities issued or guaranteed by federal agencies and u s government sponsored instrumentalities may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government income from the first trust managed municipal etf fmb the first trust california municipal high income etf fcal the first trust municipal high income etf fmhi the first trust short duration managed municipal etf fsmb and the first trust

interest rates rise and fall fcal invests principally in municipal debt securities from issuers located in california such concentration exposes the fund to political fiscal and economic conditions affecting california municipal issuers and may affect the value of the fund s investments short selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns in times of unusual or adverse market economic regulatory or political conditions a fund may not be able fully or partially to implement its short selling strategy certain funds may invest in distressed securities and many distressed securities are illiquid or trade in low volumes and thus may be more difficult to value illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by the fund or at prices approximately the value at which the fund is carrying the securities on its books certain funds are classified as non diversified and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers as a result the fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers

europeans identify the euro as one of the main symbols of the eu but for many european businesses the dollar remains the main currency of choice real economy looks at how the euro can challenge the dollar s dominance as an international currency and how switching to euros could be good for european business europeans identify the euro as one of the main symbols of the european union but for many european businesses the dollar remains the main currency of choice in his 2018 state of the union address european commission president jean claude juncker called on the eu to promote the euro as a global currency to rival the us dollar dominant dollar more than half of all non eu imports were invoiced in us dollars in 2016 at the same time just a third of the goods brought into the eu were priced in euros the three sectors the us dollar dominates are energy raw materials and transport when it comes to energy more than 80 of europe s imports are priced and paid for in us dollars despite supplies coming mainly from russia the middle east and africa that amounts to 240 billion over the last five years the situation is similar when it comes to raw materials and the food commodity markets in the transport sector nearly all invoicing for aircraft manufacturing is done in us dollars the picture is reversed for exports almost half of goods that left eu28 were invoiced in euros while a third were invoiced in us dollars a european commission study published in 2016 found that large firms invoice less in euros belgium case study a more international euro would definitely mean more growth for our company chocolate is one belgium s most famous exports and the belgian chocolate group produces more than 8 000 tons of the stuff to be sold in almost 100 countries david vermeire asian market director at the belgian chocolate group said a more international euro would definitely mean more growth for our company and for other european companies because that would make us more competitive than us companies and it would also make the sales process much easier a fifth of the company s production is exported to asia when trading with asia we always use euros that s actually a company policy of ours because it makes it easier for us administration wise vermeire adds in the european union around half of exports are denominated in the euro while a third are denominated in the us dollar in the us on the other hand most exports are priced in the local currency francesco papadia senior resident fellow at the bruegel institute explains there are some benefits in having a currency that is used internationally for a long time there s been talk about the exorbitant privilege that would accrue to the united states and this was seen essentially in financial terms what do the united states get out of the global use of the dollar trade would be a very important area in this respect invoice trading in your own currency of course would help with importers and exporters and would help small and medium firms in particular first it would eliminate foreign exchange risk secondly it would help them financially because trade credit and all sorts of funding in your national currency is more convenient the euro is already a successful currency and a strong world currency the international role of the euro is not just measured by trade businesses and foreign governments also use the currency for issuing debt by the end of 2017 more than 20 of debt issuance on international markets was denominated in euros then there are international reserves of foreign central banks where the euro represents around 20 according to the international monetary fund the us dollar s share of currency reserves is going down while the euro s share is up real economy s sasha vakulina spoke to the man in charge of the euro european commission vice president valdis dombrovskis sasha vakulina euronews business editor what is behind the data on the latest report by the international monetary fund valdis dombrovskis there are a number of factors in play in any case i think it is an indication that despite its young age and the euro is only 20 years old it is already a successful currency and a strong world currency and another factor is also that we had seen lots of unilateral actions from the us side in recent years as regards trade as regards dollar based transactions and that may also facilitate the shift toward the euro sasha vakulina in the latest communication the european commission states that completing the economic and monetary union and the banking union would help reinforce the international role of the euro valdis dombrovskis this is one of the factors we see it more as a basis for then more targeted action because it is clear that for the euro to be strong internationally first and foremost it needs to be strong domestically and that is indeed where we have an agenda on completing the banking union completing the capital markets union also proposals on how to strengthen the resilience of the eurozone and the euro area economies sasha vakulina the commission launched several targeted consultations to explore how to increase the international role of the euro in specific sectors would it make sense to introduce regulations and in some sense force businesses to use the euro valdis dombrovskis first of all if we want to strengthen the international role of the euro i don t think we can force businesses outside europe to choose the euro it is for businesses to make decisions and outside europe they can also choose dollars of local currencies basically it is their choice our approach here is not so much to change things through regulation but through creating the right incentives for market participants and also for businesses to see that they can rely on the euro and they may be protected from a unilateral action as the us is currently in a sense weaponising dollar transactions as a tool of influence

permission from the company i would now like to turn the call over to mr richard blickman richard blickman thank you thank you all for joining us today we will begin by making a few comments in connection with the press release we issued earlier today and then take your questions i would like to remind you that some of the comments made during this call and some of the answers in response to your questions by management may contain forward looking statements such statements may involve uncertainties and risks as described in the earnings release and other reports filed with the afm for today s call we d like to review the key highlights for our fourth quarter the year ended december 31 and also update you on the market our strategy and the outlook first some overall thoughts on the year and q4 results for the fourth quarter revenue of â 92 5 million and a net income of â 22 7 million compared favorably to expectations higher than anticipated gross margin of 56 4 and a decrease in sequential operating expenses helped us exceed operating profit guidance despite a 20 7 revenue decrease versus the third quarter in addition net cash continued to build and ended the year at â 199 4 million there were a couple of items to note in the fourth quarter results the 11 sequential operating expense decreased first to third quarter last year was aided by a number of favorable onetime year end recordings such recordings included reductions in the warranty provision due to favorable experience in recent years the pension curtailments benefit related to headcount reductions and some favorable r d grants received as such baseline operating expenses which include all onetime items variable compensation restructuring and forex effect declined by 2 3 to â 25 7 million in q4 versus q3 2018 in addition we had a net tax benefit in q4 due mainly to â 4 8 million in tax credits associated with the innovation books program of the dutch government for the period 2015 to 2018 this program is ongoing and related to r d activities performed in besi s 2018 results reflected solid performance and strategic execution in the assembly equipment market significantly more challenging than 2017 revenue in total of â 525 3 million and a net income of â 136 3 million declined by 11 4 and 21 3 respectively versus 2017 our 2018 revenue development was primarily affected by a second quarter slowdown in high end mobile demand followed by broad weakness in memory and other end user markets starting in the third quarter of the year revenue development was also adversely affected by forex headwinds from a 4 5 average decrease in the value of the u s dollar versus the euro in retrospect it appears that besi s second quarter or the weakness was an early indication of an industry downturn both in extended upward trajectory which began in the second half of 2016 in the current downturn we rapidly aligned productions supply chain and personnel in response to adverse market conditions as a result besi was able to maintain peer leading metrics of profitability such as gross margin and net margin of 56 8 and 25 9 and a return on equity of 33 8 in fact gross margins exceeded 56 in each quarter of 2018 despite a revenue decline of 42 6 between the second and fourth quarter of the year further we successfully reduced costs in the face of decreased customer demand due to the ongoing execution of strategic initiatives continued reductions of european fixed overhead and the realignment of temporary asian production personnel to a changing market environment also wanted to inform you of a minor change to our supplemental information presented we are opting to present only orders from now instead of backlog going forward as the preferred means of viewing besi s prospects in future periods backlog is now much less meaningful as an indicator than previously given the significant shortening of cycle times to customers which most often are less than three months periodic review for activity is nothing new to our industry in fact periods of less robust growth let us further own our strategy and financial potential to capitalize on the next major industry upturn as you can see in this next chart we took action in q2 2018 to scale back supply chain activities and temporary protection personnel once we saw that market conditions were weakening we realized our objective to reduce total headcount by approximately 16 by year end in addition besi continues to reduce european overhead as reduced fixed headcount in certain asian locations post the large production ramp in 2017 in this way we aim to keep net margins and cash generation well above prior trough levels from a longer term perspective we re on track to further reduce annualized structural cost and reach our savings target of 15 million to 20 million per year euros by 2021 our liquidity position improved significantly this quarter with net cash increasing by â 39 3 million or 24 5 due to continued healthy profit generation and reduced working capital needs in the current downturn we ended the quarter with cash and deposits of â 475 5 million or â 5 68 per share equal to almost 31 of besi stock price of â 18 48 at year end in this next slide you can see how besi s cash generation has improved over the past five years cash flow from operations has steadily improved from 19 of revenue in 2014 to 35 in 2018 even considering both industry upturns and downturns it also underlines the enhanced flexibility and scalability of the business model in recent years strong cash generation continues to support as a shareholder friendly capital allocation program for all of 2018 we return to shareholders â 209 5 million in the form of dividends and share repurchases we will have returned to investors a total of â 608 4 million or â 6 57 per share from 2011 to 2018 during the proposed dividends and share repurchases to date during 2018 we also upped our quarterly share repurchases from approximately â 6 million to â 12 million per quarter for the full year â 35 5 million in share repurchase were made an increase of 51 versus 2017 share repurchases are continuing in 2019 given continued strong cash flow generation and our solid liquidity position we proposed to pay cash dividend over the fiscal 2018 of â 1 67 per share for approval at our agm april 2019 this represents a payout ratio of approximately 91 or approximately 9 dividend yield relative to our year end stock price next i d like to speak a little bit about the current market environment here is our research now estimates that the assembly equipment market was approximately 4 6 billion u s dollars in 2018 and approximately flat with 2017 they also forecast that the market will decline by 12 4 in 2019 primarily related to slowing global economic growth trade frictions cautious customer ordering patterns and excess memory and smartphone capacity given the large build out in the 2016 and 2017 vlsi expects a rebound in 2020 of almost 10 if capacity utilization rates increase and new products are introduced despite challenging market conditions currently there are many reasons for optimism about the direction of the assembly equipment market and besi s prospects we have a leading position in the advanced packaging space whose outlook is bright as an important enabler of the digital society and the new applications which will be generated along with it the advent of the 5g capabilities artificial intelligence and the ever increasing amount of advanced logic memory capacity necessary for the built out of cloud infrastructure should be strong drivers of innovation and growth in the next customer investment route the significant customer focus currently is in the development of die bonding and packaging solutions for average smaller highly complex and feature backed 5g compatible smartphones 5g connectivity could accelerate advanced packaging adoption over the next five years in the mobile internet and computing markets and in applications such as artificial intelligence automotive electronics and the internet of things industry experts estimate that initial 5g subscriptions will be available by 2020 and that by 2024 55 of north american and 43 of northeast asian subscriptions including china and japan have migrated to 5g now a few words about guidance at present the 2019 outlook for this assembly equipment market is hard to predict there are many factors which could influence the outlook and timing of any anticipated rebound this year such a slowing global growth and trade frictions between the u s and china looking specifically to the first quarter we estimate that revenue will decline by approximately 15 versus the fourth quarter last year as difficult market conditions continue in what is traditionally our weakest quarter of the year however we expect that gross margins will remain in the 55 to 57 range as we further adjust over at levels to customer demand further we anticipated opex will increase by 25 to 30 versus the fourth quarter given approximately 3 5 million of incremental variable compensation expense and the absence of favorable onetime recordings from the fourth quarter in contrast we estimate first quarter 19 on opex will increase by only 5 to 10 versus the fourth quarter primarily due to increased r d spending and finally we estimate that our effective tax rate will range between 10 and 15 for 2019 and that capex will be approximately â 4 million that ends my prepared remarks i would like to open the call now for some questions operator question and answer session operator thank you our first question is from mr peter olofsen kepler cheuvreux go ahead sir your line is open peter olofsen good afternoon gentlemen quite a few questions but i will limit myself to some questions on the adoption of new technology and potential demand drivers so maybe starting on the mobile side of the business and specifically fan out what are you seeing in terms of the adoption of fan out wafer level packaging do you see that broadening beyond the big oem that drove the investments a few years ago and what are you seeing in terms of traction with the new 8800s series of fan out that you announced last year richard blickman well the answer is very simple at this moment we don t see any accelerated investments in fan out as we mentioned in previous calls and certain infrastructure has been installed and that is apparently at this moment sufficient to support the demand peter olofsen okay and in terms of panel level packaging any traction there or is that more for future years richard blickman that s more for future but there are some very interesting development programs where we are involved in our platform already installed in the route is widely recognized as the most advanced in the industry so for the future we can expect very positive interest peter olofsen okay and then maybe on the memory market where historically you were a little bit less exposed it seems there is an emerging trend towards flip chip do you see that happening in a meaningful way this year and is your positioning in a flip chip for memory as strong as in some other flip chip segments richard blickman i would argue even stronger now we have launched where it is yes we have launched a new version flip chip machine which is currently being qualified by several of the memory manufacturers and that machine is much faster than any other system on the market today however it s still in memory it is a very big cost battle so any way to avoid flip chip will be used by the memory manufacturers but at some point they will be forced whether that is this year or next year more likely next generation in my view but besi is in an excellent position peter olofsen okay that s helpful and then maybe finally on the computing side with your large u s idm customer looking to ramp up 10 nanometer production this year is that potentially going to drive investments in die attach and die sorting equipment this year richard blickman yes answer is yes on the previous call we mentioned that transition is now you could say finally underway and we are very well involved in that so if you could also argue if that would not be the case our numbers would look worse peter olofsen so does that mean there was already some contribution in q4 and also in q1 richard blickman yes peter olofsen okay that s fair thank you operator the next question is from nigel van putten kempen co go ahead please sir nigel van putten hi good afternoon i have a question on the gross margin guidance so it s quite remarkable that you re guiding for a similar gross margin despite having revenue year on year so i understand that you don t guide beyond the current quarter but would it make sense to say that the gross margin already see a bottom in the first quarter 2019 and improve from then on it sounds kind of where that 56 will be a low point but you ve consistently delivered on margins north of 56 for the last eight quarters and with revenue at least seasonally improving i m just asking that yes you see that as a likelihood or a possibility richard blickman well the factors influencing gross margin are in the first place product related so it depends very much on the product mix going forward and we have said in several calls that there s a difference between gross margins in the smartphone space computer space and automotive space and also there s a margin delta in the higher end versus the medium end so you have to define a certain scenario and at the same time there s ongoing cost reduction we are improving our supply chain we are improving our cost structure in operations so anticipating certain ongoing developments yes it s very encouraging that we guided sometime ago that the low end of the gross margin would be around the low 50s and it appears to be somewhat higher even taking into account headwind from a u s dollar and still a major part of our business over 50 over 60 is u s dollar based so also the dollar has an impact on that gross margin so will the dollar s slide out due to trade wars et cetera that will have a negative impact so all these variations nigel it s hard simply to say well if this is the bottom it s also the bottom of the gross margin but yes you can say it looks very very positive nigel van putten yes that s encouraging and then maybe a follow up on advanced packaging activity at the subcontractors so i think the largest that has hinted that they might enter a period of what they call disruptive investment and then they point to various new introductions like that but also system and package and my question is do you see any sort of renewed because it s not in your order book but do you see renewed early activity already maybe building in the year from that side richard blickman i think it s more confirming a longer term trend at this moment order activity across the board is as it is and it has to do as we said in the comments the overall situation uncertainty and once that uncertainty becomes less uncertain you may see investments in directions as you are indicating whether it will be really disruptive is always to be seen sometimes there s some wishful thinking but experience tells us this industry is not so fast in development whether it s going from 14 to 10 nano or euv or name many examples so in our view these new technology introductions will always go slowly but the key is that that you have to be involved and in strong positions so if it comes it certainly will help us nigel van putten very good thank you operator the next question is from mr rob sanders deutsche bank go ahead your line is open rob sanders yes hi good afternoon my first question is just if you could give an update on the tariff situation in china and how that is affecting your business clearly we heard some stories about companies moving out of china into the philippines and into thailand but i also heard that some customers are actually even taking the tools and putting ferrying them out of china so i d love to get a sort of sense of where we are on that and i ve got a couple of follow ups thanks richard blickman well we can only confirm with what you have heard and not only from semiconductor but i was sitting next to the person in an airplane from chengdu to taipei and they were moving production of lawnmowers china back to taiwan for the u s market by airway so yes that s happening also our customers clearly are developing more plans for future production expanding but those are new products outside of china there is also clear evidence that the investments of china in the semiconductor is slowing down you would expect it to increase but it s slowing down so the part of the negative sentiment is due to debt uncertainty will that ignite a lot of capex outside of china that depends enormously on gdp but sooner or later you will have a different landscape and we are excellently positioned for what s happening in both areas rob sanders but and when you think about that vlsi i know you don t tend to guide but i mean we think about this year 2019 even if just at a high level i mean clearly in the previous years when you ve outgrown vlsi growth its being driven usually by smartphone cycles and in years where there hasn t been a major smartphone upgrade you ve tended to undergrow vlsi so given that they re now putting a number out there do you think this is a year more of a kind of transition year in 2020 as the big year for you guys how are you thinking about it just at a high level richard blickman well at a high level if you follow the let s say information out of the high end smartphone universe it s pointing towards 2020 next generation and that s not unrealistic because if you look back in history there s always a two three year lapse and that would fit can you still hear me rob rob sanders i can hear you but i m assuming that the moderator won t be able to record you richard blickman so is 19 a transition year it s always hard to tell this industry is extremely let s say sensitive to gdp et cetera my biggest clearly guidance is more what s happening in the world vlsi is always behind the fact they record their observations which is fine but we re prepared whether we have an recovery soon it would be excellent and we have been able to ramp 60 even 80 quarter on quarter if it stays somewhat softer the quarter longer we have seen our gross margins you ve seen our net margins you ve seen the guidance of the opex that s also fine rob sanders got it and then just last one on the opex it looks like i wasn t forecasting that correctly so you re guiding the headline opex up 25 to 30 but that includes the 3 5 million one off richard blickman correct rob sanders so beyond that it should go back to whatever you are guiding minus 3 5 correct richard blickman correct yes rob sanders okay just want to check that thanks richard blickman and the increase is due to some higher r d spending compared to q4 operator we have a question now from mr marc hesselink ing go ahead please sir marc hesselink yes thank you for taking the question and my first question would be on the application of driving demand for 5g which you mentioned also in the press release i can imagine that there is more of the 2020 story you talked before in the call could you explain how it s going to drive demand for you is it purely that is return replacement toward smartphone or is it also that that change the chipset in 5g is driving that demand for you richard blickman the answer is not only smartphone and probably the sequence will be other devices first as smartphones thereafter so you first need a network and that s now being rolled out in many countries cities to start with and first you have the networks 5g and then you have the applications and these modules where we re involved already since four years in the development we ve installed at several customers already equipment to build those modules and there will be a whole envelope of these modules because but not a switch from one quarter to the next marc hesselink so basically so it s building up over time the period richard blickman the transition period as we said you can expect in the next five years in the next three years a rollout and that s how it typically happens marc hesselink great the earlier comment you made on the increase in r d spend something particular that you have to sustain or set some request from the clients was it just you surely want to open up the new opportunities going forward richard blickman well all of our r d programs are directly customer linked so the number of programs and the size of the programs vary in the last three four quarters it has been relatively stable and it s not because we are increasing for a certain application but it also has to do with let s say the program execution and for some of the three of the programs they will become in a more critical phase to be launched and then the cost simply increase that is very natural and it could decrease again when certain programs come to an end marc hesselink so you can see your designs in at this stage richard blickman yes but there s no structure so my comment is a good question it s not that our r d is structurally increasing it is increasing in first quarter versus the fourth quarter but just because of the stages several programs are in if it would increase structurally i would certainly inform you that we will have a higher spend in the next quarters going forward to adjust your model but your model should not change marc hesselink great thanks then on the new guidance of 15 sequential decline you kept the order intake i guess that most of the weakness is still down in the smartphone offset by some strong in cloud applications is it fair to say that automotive is then somewhere in between those two richard blickman yes but also there s a seasonal aspect the first quarter as we mentioned is always slower and key is to see what happens in april and may and that will determine yes very much what will happen in q2 but that s too early to tell and the biggest factor to repeat that again is how will this u s china negotiations settle marc hesselink okay thanks and then final question on i just want to ask a bit about the m a i know in previous calls you said that were not right yet or you cannot acknowledge that you cannot achieve anything like or anything but just in general what are you seeing on the side of potential seller richard blickman well i could answer maybe as follows that we are still as always very much interested to expand our product offering to the leaders in this industry so if an opportunity along those lines occur then we are able to act and that will determine then whether something will happen or not it s not just because prices are interesting and as you said of course it s something will occur we will be able to timely share that but what often happens in downturns certainly customers realign their strategies also the suppliers like us look at their strengths and weaknesses but also the others so in those downturns sometimes opportunities arise but again customer driven because it has to in the end improve our product position vis ã vis our main customers and at the same time due to 100 integration like klm and air france that should reduce our cost marc hesselink okay the acquisition shinkawa did was that something that could have been interesting for you or because it s in the japanese supply chain was not really something for you anyway richard blickman first of all you have to ask the question would that improve our position with our current customers and offer better positions with other customers well the answer to that question is negative but then if you look at the entire transaction where shinkawa and yamaha have joined i think for japan itself it is a very good development but for us it s very far away marc hesselink it s clear thank you very much operator we have another question for mr peter olofsen kepler cheuvreux go ahead please sir peter olofsen yes thank you i had a few follow ups maybe first for cor following the tax credit in q4 does this affect the effective tax rate going forward cor te hennepe yes there will be a slight effect usually we guide between 12 and 15 now we can say for the rest of the year between 10 and 15 fluctuations are simply because of profits in jurisdictions and certain facilitations or arrangements but it s between 10 and 15 so there will be some effect of this credit peter olofsen okay and then there may be a follow up on one of the earlier questions on china at the annual analyst meeting in june you set out some ambitious targets to grow the revenue share of china can you disclose what proportion of revenues in 2018 did come from china richard blickman well you first there are three different sets of customers in china one is the china china customers at chinese companies number two is joint ventures with outside china companies and 3 is outside customers having factories in china like an sd like in intel and if you look at that landscape clearly chinese semiconductor industry will continue and over time we will gain certain market shares the question is of course with the outside companies that situation has i would say changed in anticipation of whatever outcome so that part will be affected on the other hand for us there is no difference whether these machines are installed in china or in philippines or in thailand or in vietnam we re happy to install anywhere so as a percentage china will change but there s a total probably not peter olofsen okay and then maybe another question on your revenue exposure in the past you have disclosed your exposure to mobile computing automotive et cetera is it already something you can disclose or are you still compiling those data richard blickman we re still compiling the data by the way to your earlier question china what is very interesting our revenue with some exceptions but on average in china has been about 20 25 of revenue our main competitor appears for over 50 so bottom line it can also have a very positive effect on us peter olofsen also it s a big opportunity for you richard blickman yes peter olofsen yes okay so but on the ad market disclosure that is something that will follow at a later stage then richard blickman my guess would be that smartphones high end smartphone communication which was 35 maybe is now around 30 computing is definitely 25 and auto may have gone up from 17 to 20 that s the difference mix spare parts has gone up and so scrap has gone to 15 but we will confirm that data once it is fully settled and in the end we will report peter olofsen okay thank you richard blickman next operator our next question is from mr edwin de jong nibc go ahead please sir edwin de jong good afternoon gentlemen a few questions left on 3d sensing has there been any developments in the last quarter your what s your end client is saying that and or there is also adopting this technology and does that require equipment from your side or can you tell a little bit about that richard blickman well there s an ongoing development on the next generation in the 3d sensing where we are certainly evolved and that is likely to be part of the next generation for 2020 so you will have some further testing in early 19 or late 19 models or model and then a full rollout for a next generation in 2020 that s what we hear but we re involved in many of the development programs edwin de jong okay and then maybe also for on working capital you had quite a large inflow in q4 31 million and of course that s for a large part due to the decreasing revenue is there also a seasonal effect in it and if so maybe can you maybe give a little bit feeling how much that would be cor te hennepe usually there is a seasonal effect you see we always look at and those numbers you can t go to that and if you look at the dsos net inventory turn in rapid declining market as we ve seen it now inventory turn usually worsens a bit before it goes up then all you need to do is work out dso usually stays flat or increases a bit when a business is down customers tend to sit on their money somewhat longer so there s a seasonal effect when revenue goes down your working capital will be less but if you look at the metrics they will go up a bit before it will be back to normal once specifically looking at the inventory once the inventories are back on a normal level but we are organized in a way that that is no risk for obsolete it s not a big topic but we do see some relatively some higher revenue as compared to earlier days but that would be back to normal in the course of 2019 so if you look at development of besi s net cash we always see three quarters of growth then you pay out a dividend of course then the net cash is back to where the levels where we would like it to be net goes up so there s nothing specific about it edwin de jong okay thank you and then maybe on tax benefit and that went for a couple of years i think you said in the answer cor te hennepe that s a technicality once you start to apply for an innovation box you have to do that when your tax loss carry forwards are reducing when you do the application you can go back to the years that haven t been assessed finally that those years are always lagging behind reality lagging behind the current filings so we could go back to 15 because that was still not finally assessed but that s normal that s normal to term edwin de jong okay that s also something that you can expect going forward cor te hennepe yes but this is of course as you can see for 15 16 17 18 but going forward it will have as we mentioned earlier an effect on the etr so that s why we now said the range that you can expect is a bit wider but it s it used to be between 12 and 15 so there is some effect yes edwin de jong okay and then finally one last we talk regularly about the developments in solar is there anything news there richard blickman no there s continued evaluation of our technology at those major solar companies there are some programs in a well advanced stage and it could be that they will materialize this year so there s no at first evolved it s only it s market acceptance it is cost it is life cycle and life time guarantee and that is the testing that that takes very long but the interest is still very positive edwin de jong that could be an issue for later this year maybe richard blickman yes edwin de jong okay thank you operator and we have a question from mr rob sanders deutsche bank go ahead please sir rob sanders yes thanks for taking my follow up it s just a few housekeeping ones one is on the dividend payout ratio you re averaging i think 96 over the last four years on your dividend payout ratio so should i start modeling this going forward because i think you ve said historically it s a 40 to 100 range so just from a modeling purposes that would be good and the other question is just on if you can give me an update on your activities in silicon photonics are you doing anything there i mean your competitors moving forward so i d love to get initial view on that thank you richard blickman well dividend is very much depending upon our continued performance so if we continue to perform as we are doing also in relative terms there is no reason to change our allocation policy so it may go up and down our profitability but the policy is as it stands on the second question i already answered that we re very much involved in photonics also different photonics related to the 5g modules in a very good position so the major installed base already so yes that s a really interesting segment of the market rob sanders okay great thank you operator gentlemen we have no further questions please continue richard blickman well then i think everyone taking the time to listen to this call and your questions if any further questions don t hesitate to contact us bye bye operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes this event call thank you for attending you may disconnect your lines

calling toll free at 1 800 621 1675 or visiting www ftportfolios com a prospectus should be read carefully before investing past performance is no assurance of future results investment return and market value of an investment in a fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost principal risk factors a fund s shares will change in value and you could lose money by investing in a fund an investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency there can be no assurance that a fund s investment objectives will be achieved an investment in a fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges the risks of investing in each fund are spelled out in its prospectus shareholder report and other regulatory filings an index etf seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield of an index you should anticipate that the value of an index fund s shares will decline more or less in correlation with any decline in the value of the index an index fund s return may not match the return of the index unlike a fund the indices do not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore do not incur the expenses incurred by a fund investors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share s net asset value shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account however unlike mutual funds shares may only be redeemed directly from the fund by authorized participants in very large creation redemption units if the fund s authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem fund shares may trade at a discount to the fund s net asset value and possibly face delisting one of the principal risks of investing in a fund is market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a fund fund shares or securities in general may fall in value an actively managed etf is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio in managing such a fund s investment portfolio the portfolio managers management teams advisor or sub advisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result a fund that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks including limited diversification an investment in a fund concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically certain funds may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger more established companies an investment in a fund containing securities of non u s issuers is subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations political risks withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting non u s issuers these risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in or with significant operations in emerging market countries a fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market investments in sovereign bonds involve special risks because the governmental authority that controls the repayment of the debt may be unwilling or unable to repay the principal and or interest when due in times of economic uncertainty the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligations preferred securities high yield securities corporate bonds government bonds municipal bonds and senior loans are subject to credit risk call risk income risk interest rate risk inflation risk and prepayment risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest and or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result credit risk is heightened for floating rate loans and high yield securities call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher yielding debt instruments held by a fund performance could be adversely impacted income risk is the risk that income from a fund s fixed income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed income securities in a fund will decline because of rising market interest rates inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected this may result in a decline in a fund s income senior floating rate loans are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated as a result the risks associated with these loans are similar to the risks of high yield fixed income instruments high yield securities or junk bonds are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings and therefore may be highly speculative these securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history narrowly focused operations and or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity the market for high yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities income from municipal bonds held by a fund could be declared taxable because of among other things unfavorable changes in tax laws adverse interpretations by the internal revenue service or state tax authorities or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer convertible securities have characteristics of both equity and debt securities and as a result are exposed to certain additional risks the values of certain synthetic convertible securities will respond differently to market fluctuations than a traditional convertible security because such synthetic convertibles are composed of two or more separate securities or instruments each with its own market value a fund is subject to the credit risk associated with the counterparty creating the synthetic convertible instrument synthetic convertible securities may also be subject to the risks associated with derivatives exchange traded notes etns are senior unsecured unsubordinated debt securities whose returns are linked to the performance of a particular market benchmark or strategy minus applicable fees the value of an etn may be influenced by various factors real estate investment trusts reits and real estate operating companies reocs are subject to certain risks including changes in the real estate market vacancy rates and competition volatile interest rates and economic recession master limited partnerships mlps are subject to certain risks including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics energy conservation taxes price controls and other regulatory policies of various governments in addition there is the risk that a mlp could be taxed as a corporation resulting in decreased returns from such mlp the use of futures options and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset index or rate which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives these risks are heightened when a fund s portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance a fund s return or as a substitute for a position or security rather than solely to hedge or offset the risk of a position or security held by a fund a fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash rather than in kind securities as a result an investment in a fund may be less tax efficient than an investment in an exchange traded fund that effects its creations and redemptions for in kind securities a fund s investment in repurchase agreements may be subject to market and credit risk with respect to the collateral securing the repurchase agreements alternative investments may employ complex strategies have unique investment and risk characteristics and may not be suitable for all investors certain funds may invest in other investment companies including closed end funds cefs etfs and affiliated etfs which involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds in addition a fund s investment performance and risks may be related to the investment and performance of the underlying funds a fund may invest in u s government obligations u s treasury obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government securities issued or

thank you for joining nexa s fourth quarter earnings call on slide three right after this disclaimer page you ll see the agenda for today s call today we are going through the following topics fourth quarter main events after that the brief overview of zinc market and then we discuss our operational performance consolidated results and guidance closing the first part of the call i will talk about nexa s main initiatives for 2019 and then we ll open it for a q a session please go to slide four let s start with some recent highlights 2018 was a very dynamic year for nexa and we are proud to have delivered what we promised to the market in the first full year following our ipo among our most recent achievements we met our production guidance for all metals after very strong fourth quarter performance we will be paying the installation license for our greenfield project aripuana and we are excited to have started the construction of the project at the end of 2018 as we published on january 15th our 2019 guidance for zinc contained in concentrate is higher 3 than 2018 when consider the mid range of the guidance we are confident that during 2019 we will be able to reap the benefits from the mine development initiatives carried out during 2018 mostly in cerro lindo mine in addition to production increase we are also forecasting a higher capex given the already mentioned aripuana project later we will give you more details on our guidance on the financial front we have renegotiated part of our debt to extend maturities at the lower cost we have returned capital to our shareholders by distributing 80 million in share premium and recently we announced 30 million share buyback program that is already under execution as a result of the reduced cash generation in 2018 we are announcing now a dividend payment of 70 million on march 28 2019 with the record date on march 14 we have recently announced that our board of directors has approved the appointment of rodrigo menck to succeed mario bertoncini as nexa s as cfo from march 1st menck will be replacing mario menck is an executive with more than 20 years of experience in finance treasury structured finance and capital markets he worked for more than 10 years in banks such as bankboston westlb citi and bnp paribas he was also structured finance manager and shared services director for braskem a brazilian company he joined nexa in 2016 as head of treasury and investor relations where he led our team in the restructuring of our debt long term and short term and he carried out other different initiatives menck was also directly involved in the company s ipo and his current position at nexa s is the head of m a finally i would like to remind you that we maintain our focus on financial discipline sound capital structure and low leverage we believe it will be essential to support the current and future growth of our company most important nexa is continuously embracing best practice in terms of environment emissions water consumption dams and safety standards we also believe in working together with our local communities in order to promote its economic and social development please now move to slide five here we will be addressing market conditions on average zinc went down 19 in the fourth quarter of 2018 when compared to the same quarter of 2017 and the average price was 2 631 per ton when comparing the full year of 2018 with full year of 2017 the average price was only 1 higher however the market dynamic was completely different in 2017 the price had an upward trend throughout the year as the fundamentals were growing stronger in 2018 there was a downward trend although the fundamentals were also strong and metal stocks decreased to all time lows the continuous trade war between china and the us negatively impacted market confidence and sentiment as a consequence of this price went down for 2019 we highlight three key topics first environmental protection in china there s still the main question mark for the zinc price how much this will affect the balance of supply and demand the smelters are struggling to restart or keep production under the new regulation we believe it can result in another year of market debts ph and therefore pushing the price even lower second concentrate balance it is expected to be at the surplus as the smelter consumption remains low and new mine operations are expected to ramp up during the year there s a positive trend for treatment charge that are already increased in the spot market this is positive for nexa as we are still new buyers of concentrates it s important to say that we do not believe as some experts mining production in china will grow in 2019 because of the same environmental restrictions we mentioned before third the behavior of zinc price will be directly related to the development of the us china trade talks and in the fed s indications of a slower increase in interest rates about copper and led price they had similar behaviors as zinc price along the fourth quarter of 2018 volatility was mainly caused by the uncertainties related to the trading war now i m going to pass to mario bertoncini who will discuss our results mario please mario antonio bertoncini senior vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you tito ph turning on to page six we discuss our mining performance in the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 as usual let me remind you that we convert our production by metal to a zinc equivalent basis using full year 2018 lme prices in order to present comparable figures as we had anticipated at the beginning of last year our mining production in 2018 would increase throughout the quarters given our plans on mining development particularly in cerro lindo mine the zinc equivalent production in nexa s mining operations totaled 150 000 tons in fourth quarter of 18 10 higher compared to the previous quarter as mentioned in cerro lindo the mine development program supported higher production in the last quarter of 18 with higher treated ore and zinc concentrate when comparing our mining production throughout this year we have consistently increased our zinc equivalent production since first quarter of this year having reached a new level of production that s prepared us to achieve our guidance for this year that will be discussed later production on a zinc equivalent basis totaled 556 000 tons during 2018 as a whole down 2 6 compared to 571 000 tons recorded in 2017 at the bottom right part of this page we have our mining cash cost after by product credits that increased by 0 15 ph to 0 31 per pound in the fourth quarter of 18 taking a more careful look on this 0 15 ph of delta we will note that 0 17 is due to lower credit of by products given the decrease on lme prices during this period and 0 03 per pound from higher operating costs mainly in peru primarily driven by higher development cost out of these two factors our cost performance was as planned and efficient please let s move on to the slide seven where we present our smelting performance our smelters performed very well in 2018 having growing production on the second half of the year compared to the first half stabilizing production at full capacity in practical terms the sales of metallic zinc and zinc oxide in 2018 were 4 higher than the previous year totaling 617 000 tons driven by this stable production during the year cajamarquilla that was impacted in 2017 by that unusual rains and floods in peru sold 88 000 tons in the strong fourth quarter of last year with sales 4 up from the last quarter of 17 and also the third quarter of 18 in the full year cajamarquilla sold 333 000 tons of metallic zinc 6 higher than the previous year 17 tres marias and juiz de fora maintained that performance close to full capacity cash cost net of by product credits decreased by 18 to 1 10 per pound a delta of 0 24 in the fourth quarter of 18 compared to the same period of the previous year this delta in cost is mainly due to lower raw material costs driven by lower zinc prices and the brazilian currency devaluation that in this case impacted positively our smelters in brazil moving on to slide eight here on the slide eight we present our revenues and ebitda per segment as usual please note that these segmented sales only sales not ebitda includes intersegment revenues or some overlap that will be offset on a consolidated sales presented on the following page revenues for the mining segment was down 24 in the fourth quarter of 18 versus the same quarter in the previous year mainly due to lower metal prices and reduced volumes in cerro lindo these impacted our adjusted mining ebitda which fell 52 year over year reaching 88 million in the fourth quarter of 18 in addition to lower revenues we incurred higher costs driven by development costs as already mentioned bringing ebitda margin for mining to 31 in mining when comparing full year of 18 against 17 adjusted ebitda fell 18 to 430 million reaching a 37 ebitda margin for the smelting division despite the 17 drop in revenues in the fourth quarter of 18 compared to the same quarter in the previous year our adjusted ebitda increased 31 driven by higher sales volumes lower operating costs and tax credits recorded in brazil in the fourth quarter the adjusted ebitda margin for smelting was up 300 basis points to 9 year over year smelting revenues for the full year of 18 increased 4 while adjusted ebitda was up 14 compared to 2017 in 2018 mining accounted for 71 of our ebitda and smelting for the remaining 29 let s move on to page nine where we talk about our financial results our consolidated revenues totaled 2 5 billion in the full year of 18 up 2 compared to previous year in last quarter of 18 sales went down 17 compared to the same quarter of previous year impacted by lower base metals prices only partially offset by higher metal sales as already presented during the full year of 18 adjusted ebitda was down 9 as a result of higher costs as explained before resulting on a consolidated ebitda margin of 24 compared to 27 of the previous year on the last quarter our consolidated ebitda went down 41 particularly given the impact on net revenues of that quarter on the upper right part of this slide we present our capex breakdown we spent 137 million in the capex in the last quarter of last year totaling 300 million in the full year of 18 all the details on the capex will be explained in our guidance section on the bottom right part of this page is our sound operational free cash flow before debt principal and distribution resulting in 13 of cash conversion before expansion capex as we announced it last month we are in a smooth transition where i m transferring my responsibilities as nexa cfo to rodrigo menck by the end of this month menck is fully engaged in our process priorities and agenda and i m sure nexa financial team is in very good hands i ask menck now to present our considerations on capital structure and guidance and would like to thank you all for the trust opportunity to interact and work together wish you the best for menck nexa and all of you thank you rodrigo nazareth menck incoming senior vicepresident of finance and chief financial officer thank you mario regarding our debt profile and cash position we continue to report a healthy balance sheet with extended debt profile and low leverage the average maturity of our total debt was 6 1 years with an average cost of 4 8 per annum in us dollar terms we have continued to implement initiatives in 2018 in order to reduce debt cost and extend maturities on the pie chart you can see the debt breakdown both in terms of modality and currency almost three fourths come from debt and capital markets being the remaining amount compounded by banks ecas and bndes in terms of currency 91 of our total debt is denominated in us dollars and 9 in reais we have reported a net debt balance of 303 million as a result of a cash balance of 1 1 billion versus a total debt of 1 4 billion resulting in a net leverage of 0 5 times net debt to ebitda a comfortable position to move ahead with our higher capex plan guided for 2019 on the next slides we will discuss guidance for production and capex in more details please move to slide 11 i would like to start reiterating that we met our 2018 mining production guidance for all metals driven by a production recovery in the fourth quarter 18 as planned and our smelting segment had a strong performance throughout the year reaching the top of the range of our sales volume guidance for 2019 as tito mentioned before we expect zinc mining production to expand approximately 3 versus 2018 considering the mid range of the guidance presented herein nexa s main assumptions for such increase are first higher treated ore volumes compensating lower grades already forecasted by technical reports second stabilized production throughout 2019 at levels achieved in the fourth quarter of 18 in the cerro lindo operation which operates now close to its 21 000 ton per day processing capacity as a benefit from mining development initiatives carried out during 2018 third stabilization of cerro pasco mines production after changes in processes and additional safety procedures that were implemented along 2018 and finally productivity gains in brazil mainly with the implementation of an additional shift in vazante increasing operating hours in the mine on the smelter side we expect relatively stable sales volumes year over year considering the mid range of our guidance with a 1 increase in production available for sale key points for 2019 are first a potential slowdown of the cajamarquilla plant during the implementation of the jarosite process conversion during the third quarter of 19 despite this potential short term production slowdown we expect a 3 gain in recovery rates once the process is fully implemented and second productivity gains in tres marias from increased use of silicate mix as well as in juiz de fora with higher participation of secondary feed materials please move to page 12 where we talk about capex and opex here on slide 12 we present our guidance for capex and expenses on mineral exploration and project development 2018 capex reached 300 million in 2018 as already mentioned including 137 million invested in the fourth quarter of 18 capex was overall 40 million above our 2018 guidance of 260 million as we decided to expedite some investments in the end of the year being approximately 8 million related to magistral and 7 million related to vazante in addition to 14 million of operating expenses related to the atacocha and el porvenir integration which were reclassified as capex as well as higher sustaining capex in cerro lindo due to mine development initiatives in 2019 we are increasing our capex guidance to 420 million this includes initial investments in the aripuana project in the amount of 140 million we estimate spending approximately 35 of the total 392 million of the projects this year excluding aripuana our planned investments amounts approximately 280 million similar to last year therefore nearly half of the 420 million will be directed to expansion continuously focusing on brownfield life of mine extension and our greenfield projects pipeline aside from aripuana just mentioned main projects in 2019 are vazante mine deepening with 24 million and the jarosite conversion process at the cajamarquilla smelter with 24 million as well both projects have been extensively discussed in the past years in mineral exploration we continue our efforts to increase reserves and resources aiming an average life of mine of 12 years for our current operations our minerals exploration expense guidance of 75 million considers 36 million to brownfield and 33 million to greenfield exploration our project development expense guidance of 53 million includes projects in fel1 and fel2 stages of which 23 million is related to greenfields although impacting ebitda this type of expense is key to develop projects that will support nexa s growth in the coming years finally tito will address our main initiatives for the year tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer thank you menck please move to slide 13 where we highlight some key initiatives for 2019 our operations are always working on improving its efficiency productivity and lower costs this allows us to operate in different market scenarios with the conclusion of vazante s dry stacking project along the year nexa s major mines cerro lindo and vazante which represent 70 of our total production we will be adopting the dry stacking method a process that is much safer and environmental friendly we ll keep working on our greenfield pipeline primarily with the advance of the construction of aripuana s mine and plant which includes contracting main equipment and servicing among others in addition to aripuana we intend to conclude in 2019 fel2 for the magistral and pukaqaqa projects along the year we intend to deliver an updated mineral reserves and resource simulations for vazante atacocha el porvenir morro agudo and shalipayco at our mine segments the main objective is to maintain cerro lindo production stable at full capacity in other words 21 000 tons of run of mine per day vazante also should some improvement in production along the year as it was mentioned before we estimate to reach 97 of zinc recovery rate in cajamarquilla by the end of the year as well as increased usage of secondary raw material in juiz de fora production and increase silicate concentrates in tres marias resulting in a higher productivity in our smelters before we go to the q a session i would like to say a few words about mario bertoncini mario is leaving us for a new professional challenge and i m sure he will be very successful without mario s contribution and work we would not be at the point we are today he had an important role in our ipo as well as in the structuring of our company and i m sure we would not be where we are today without his efforts and contribution thank you mario i wish you good luck and i welcome menck in his new position let s move to the questions questions and answers operator thank you sir we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question today will come from carlos de alba with morgan stanley please go ahead with your question carlos de alba morgan stanley co llc analyst good morning everyone and good afternoon for you guys mario first of all all the best in the new challenges and thank you very much for these few years of working together it was a very good experience so all the best in the future if i may ask about 2019 tito or the rest of the team is there any special sequence in terms of output and i guess cost performance your last year obviously as you just pointed out the second half of the year particularly the fourth quarter was really strong so in order to avoid any surprises are there any comments on the sequence for this year that you may point out and then on brazil given the tragic accident on the tailing dam there do you expect any potential impact in nexa s operations or production clearly vazante moving to dry stacking is a major initiative and i guess the company anticipates to where the industry may be moving forward but are there any comments or considerations that we need to be aware given what happened in brazil tragically thank you tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer thank you carlos i m going to leave to mario to answer the first part of the question about the costs and then i ll answer your question about how we see the future of operations in brazil i mean short term in brazil after the accident of brumadinho mario please mario antonio bertoncini senior vice president finance and chief financial officer carlos thanks for your message regarding production and costs a different from last year what we are planning for this year is a more flat production throughout the quarters we don t see that pattern that we had in these two previous years we are prepared with cerro lindo at full capacity and although that mine is in very good shape we re prepared now to have a more flat production throughout the quarter regarding costs will keep investing in mine development we should expect pattern costs kind of pattern that we saw last year for a while i think a fair assumption is to consider that cost structure since we ll keep investing in mining development particularly in cerro lindo atacocha well and el porvenir tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer i would add to that if we have if everything goes as we expect we should have some gains in productivity as well right so comparing this year with the previous one probable performance will be a little bit better mostly also because we are increasing production in our mines and we should have a slight growth also in our smelters answering the second question about brazil how we see our production being affected or not in 2019 i don t see anything actually directly impacting us you have to remember that our dams in brazil are all of them the operating dams all of them are downstream dams so we do not have any issue about the new regulation that was released at the beginning of this week actually about the upstream dams not being allowed to stay in operations about the dry stacking at vazante we re expecting to have this being ready to be used on the second half which is very positive for us it s positive for our not only for our operations but also for our reputation i would say it s good to be perceived as a company that is actually moving on with a different approach in terms of disposal of inaudible cadence thank you carlos de alba morgan stanley co llc analyst thank you operator and our next question will come from caio ribeiro of credit suisse please go ahead mr ribeiro your line may be muted your line is open sir caio ribeiro credit suisse brasil sa ctvm analyst yes hi good morning everyone and thank you for the opportunity my first question is regarding your expansion projects other than aripuana i just wanted to ask if the timing has changed at all in regards to those other projects and after aripuana what would you envision today to be the project that would be the next priority and whether you would consider carrying out investments in two projects at the same time or wait until aripuana starts up before kicking off investments in another project and then my second question in regards to dividends the latest announcement that nexa made in regards to the 70 million dividend payout for march it comes well above the 2 minimum dividend yield policy that the company has in place right now so i just wanted to see if you would consider revising this dividend policy upwards given the low leverage that the company has right now those are my two questions and also mario i just wanted to wish you the best of luck in your new challenge thanks tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer thank you for the questions about expansions what happened is aripuana is going well we started up at the end of last year we are on track on our contractors with the contractors equipment has already been ordered so we re confident we should finish the construction by the end of 2020 and starting up 2021 what happened about other projects is the following we until a few months ago we were expecting to finish fel3 for shalipayco assuming that we will use the ore mined in shalipayco in the facility in el porvenir so we work most of the time with the concept that we had only to open up the mine and not building the plant the beneficiation plant what happened is when we conclude the fel1 we came to the conclusion that it was much better actually to increase the capacity of the mine in shalipayco and actually work with the possibility to build a new plant there so we are moving on with the fel 2 of shalipayco looking at two possibilities the first one is ok we re going to have an independent project a larger plant a larger mine with a larger plant and it s dependent on el porvenir and there is an variation of those studies where we look at the possibility that before we start production in the shalipayco site we trucked some ore to be used in atacocha it implied a reschedule of shalipayco for at least 10 months which means that we were planning to have the fel3 of shalipayco by sometime 2020 and we are moving to the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021 which means that when we finish the studies of shalipayco we will be finishing magistral studies at the same time if you ask me today what i think about that since we do not want to stockpile the projects we have been saying that for as far as i remember we should actually have to choose in between the development of the shalipayco as a full project i mean mine and plant or magistral as a full project my guess today is that probably magistral will be the preferred one for two reasons the numbers in magistral have been showing much more traction than the shalipayco as an independent project and secondly we ve been saying all the time that we want to have more production of copper so we have to wait and see i think this is going to be a good problem for us to have to choose between the two projects sometimes in the second half of 2020 or the beginning of 2021 in terms of the dividends mario you want to mention something mario antonio bertoncini senior vice president finance and chief financial officer regarding dividends i think first we have paid more than we had announced as a policy but at the same time keeping consistency i think is quite important what we did in this dividend is not that much different from what we did last year when we paid in 2018 right from now on we should keep more or less the same consistency i would say respecting not only the market cap and dividend yield but also the capacity of cash generation the ebitda and the obligations ahead i would say quite well that at this point keeping the track record and building this consistent with the market is even more important than the policy per se tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer and as i like to say all the time we are sticking with our concept of paying 2 what is wrong with the market cap thank you caio ribeiro credit suisse brasil sa ctvm analyst perfect that s very clear if i might just have one quick follow up tito i imagine that these developments with shalipayco they might impact the returns of the project as a whole but when you run the analysis do you still view the implied irr of this project above the minimum return that you would establish for a new project and above your cost of capital tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer yes yes all the projects will be analyzed based on the minimum hurdle rate of 15 mario antonio bertoncini senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer yeah we have not changed anything and actually when you talk about shalipayco we re saying that we re seeing a different project because it s going to be larger than the one we were talking before thank you caio ribeiro credit suisse brasil sa ctvm analyst perfect understood thank you operator our next question will come from orest wowkodaw of scotiabank please go ahead orest wowkodaw scotia capital inc analyst hi good morning everybody two questions for me first of all can you provide any cost guidance for 2019 obviously costs were very good on a per pound basis in 2018 i m just wondering whether you anticipate those unit costs to move up in 2019 and then secondly just wondering if there was any impact from the recent truck drivers strike in peru and whether that had any impact on your operations thanks tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer hi orest thanks for your questions starting from the second one no no impact at all on the drivers strike in peru we haven t had any impact and we don t see any impact for us orest wowkodaw scotia capital inc analyst great tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer regarding the cost to guidance we haven t provided the cost guidance for nexa but what i can tell you is first if we divide cost in three main fronts let s assume first the operating costs per se right referring particular on mining here we should expect a flat operating costs for the company on a per unit basis some productivity gains we should expect as we grow in production technical difficulty as we produce more we should technical difficulty total costs or kind of half of that total cost the second aspect is that costs that are not operational per se and related particularly on the development cost mining development and we are budgeting and expecting to spend in mine development pretty much the same amounts we spent last year we ll keep developing the mining fronts of particularly cerro lindo and pasco and also vazante orest wowkodaw scotia capital inc analyst okay tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer and the third aspect in costs that we have to pay attention is exogenous one ph is the impact on foreign exchange rate on our costs this is a low impact in peru since we are much more exposed to us dollars as you know there we pay in salaries only salaries on wages the workforce accounted for 17 18 of our total costs but in brazil it s different in brazil 80 83 of our costs are in brl brazilian reais and based on how we evolve fx can have impact on our cost side orest wowkodaw scotia capital inc analyst okay thank you very much mario and good luck operator the next question will come from thiago lofiego of bradesco bbi please go ahead with your question thiago lofiego bradesco sa ctvm analyst hi thank you first of all mario best of luck in this new career phase wish you all the best i have two questions the first one on capital allocation what s the rationale behind the canceling of the atacocha delisting especially considering your low level of debt does it mean that we should not expect this delisting to happen let s say in the next year or so or even new projects eventually delisting should we not wait expect that to happen the second question about the zinc market what s your view on concentrate prices from here and also we ve seen tcs pressured by some logistics difficulties at townsville port so what s your outlook for treatment charges from here as well thank you tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer thank you for your questions about the capital location on why we gave up the delisting of atacocha has much more to do with the volatility we were seeing at the end of the year at the beginning of this year meaning that we should we would come back as soon as we feel comfortable about that it s a priority for us but it s not a primary item in the first item in our list so we have been very conservative in terms of allocation of capital our main priority has to do with the development of our capex our projects and seemed to us to that when we announced that we ll start a process of this was a good opportunity but given this volatility we ve decided to stop it which doesn t mean that depending how the market behaves the next few months we will come back to that ok it s just a tactical decision let s put this way in terms of the zinc market we haven t seen many differences in between what we would say three to four months ago and what we are seeing today even when you mention that we may see china is slowing down a little bit in terms of the general market demand for zinc is still there and supply is not there at all metal stocks were dropping along the last three months and actually recovered a little bit the last two weeks two to three weeks which has to do with the holidays in china so we need to wait and see what s going to happen in the next two to three weeks what is reflecting in the market right now is the fact that the tcs has to do with the lack of supply of concentrate in the chinese market which is making actually the tcs moving up i ll tell you what we ve seen deals done in between 200 and 220 in peru in the last three weeks some people mentioned that there were deals done around 250 but it seems to us that the tcs the benchmark should be remain around in between 210 220 which is really good when you compare with last year s which was around 140 per ton one thing that s important to observe the zinc price being where they are today in between 2 600 and 2 700 is still a very strong price showing that what we ve been saying along the year the two years is there it is still there we have to regret the fact that the potential trade war and the commercial the trade factors the perception about the global economy being affected trade war affected mostly the prices along the last year but if we see this situation changing based on the negotiations that are being carried out by the us and china we may actually see price coming back again as we saw in the first quarter of last year we have to just wait and see but we re still very confident about that thank you thiago lofiego bradesco sa ctvm analyst thank you operator the next question will come from alex hacking of citi please go ahead alexander hacking citigroup global markets inc analyst hi yes good morning i just wanted to follow up on the tc rcs i got a little confused on the answer are you saying that the tc rcs you expect to move up this year or to stay relatively stable and then i guess second question any change to the terms of the tc rcs in terms of payables and escalators and things like that and then thirdly just again related to the smelting business has there been any change to the regional premiums that you see locally in latin america in terms of the zinc price thank you tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer thank you for your questions let me clarify the tcs we were seeing the reference price for the last year was around 140 per ton spot market was around it as well in the last month or so spot price went up to 200 220 and we are seeing the possibility for the benchmark be around 220 as well without any changes in the free zinc and any changes in the escalation so we would not see anything different from that alexander hacking citigroup global markets inc analyst okay thanks for that clarification tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer thank you alexander hacking citigroup global markets inc analyst and then on the regional any changes on the regional premiums tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer no no actually premiums have been very flat i mean if you see it up and down around 10 to 15 which is not relevant at all alexander hacking citigroup global markets inc analyst okay thank you tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer they re stable they have been stable for i would say the last nine months until then they were going up so they ve been stable for the last nine months yes thank you alexander hacking citigroup global markets inc analyst thank you operator operator instructions our next question today will come from oscar cabrera with cibc please go ahead oscar cabrera cibc world markets inc analyst thank you operator and good morning everyone i d also like to echo my thanks to mario for all his help during our initiation of coverage mario thank you very much and all the best in the new challenge and then also like to welcome rodrigo into the team we look forward to working with you and so in terms of the questions your mineral exploration budget of 75 million i know you want to increase your reservoir s life but how many more years do you think we have to be at these levels to achieve that and then along the same line on your project development capex of 53 million how should we think about this number as we move to 2020 2021 do you need to keep it at those levels to maintain the cost on the operations tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer oscar thank you for your questions very good ones i would say about the exploration expenses i would say the following what happened is we have spent a lot of money and we know that mostly in trying to extend the life of our mines and the results have been very positive ones so we ve set a target for us we want to reach a minimum 12 years reserves for each of our mines which implies that we should be spending enough capital until we reach this point but we are not too far from that if you look at our track record along the last three years you will see that it s possible to be achievable in the couple of years so we are confident we will do it so part of the value we are spending right now the 17 million has to do with that i should say probably almost half of it of course we want to keep investing in greenfield exploration and some of brownfield as well has not directed to do with life of mine this has much more to do with the areas that surrounds our current operations so my guess is in the short and medium term we should see this number coming down a little bit not too much but should come down and the same applies to the development projects why is that we have a pipeline of seven projects and all of them actually now six because aripuana is under development all of now were pretty much almost at the same stage so as i said before today when we reach the point that we have to choose in between for example magistral and shalipayco the amount that we will be spending for the products that will be in our shelf will be dramatically reduced so i would say that we re in a transition time for the next two years or three years of at most we will be spending more with the projects but the trends are that we would be able to start to refine the use of capital in new projects so it s just a transition time and let s be able and we assume that we should be able to enjoy it as long as our cash generation is positive one some of the analysts were saying you are showing a negative free cash flow for the next year it s true but you have to consider that first we are still underleveraged and secondly we are investing in growth i think the important thing here has to do we re talking about projects and exploration expense that you bring to us a future growth in the next five years that s where we want to be we have a very conservative approach about those expenses but at the same time we have a very not say aggressive but consistent brand to grow thank you oscar cabrera cibc world markets inc analyst thank you very much if i may a second question in your presentation on the slide 10 you say that you wanted to continue to analyze opportunities to keep reducing debt cost and extend the average maturity the maturities that i see here that you disclose are not that great but can you elaborate a little bit more on this what are you looking to do with this rodrigo nazareth menck incoming senior vicepresident of finance and chief financial officer hello oscar this is menck speaking here given that our debt is pretty much coming from debt capital markets the only short tenure debt we have is the nexa peru bond that matures in 2023 at this point in time we don t see economic advantage in having a liability management transaction on it but this is always a possibility should the market price covers allow us aside from that only in case we have some project related financing along the years which come with the larger tenures and then will push this a bit more forward right but other than that the bank market is not lending lines for that longer terms and we also don t have that much for bank lines only 200 million out of the 1 4 billion i don t know if i covered what you wanted oscar cabrera cibc world markets inc analyst no that s it thank you very much rodrigo nazareth menck incoming senior vicepresident of finance and chief financial officer you are welcome operator operator instructions having no further questions this will conclude our question and answer session at this time i d like to turn the conference back over to mr tito martins for any closing remarks tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer thank you very much i would like to thank everybody for being with us here today and once more i ll say that nexa is moving in the right direction i hope the market perceives this and once more mario i would really like to say good luck to you i m going to repeat it and good luck to menck who is joining us have a good day thank you bye bye operator the conference is now concluded we thank you all for attending today s presentation you may now disconnect your lines duration 55 minutes call participants tito botelho martins junior president and chief

5 william phillips please do your thing the matter of sluggish wage growth within developed economies is one of the great modern subjects of debate in economics the famous phillips curve which suggests inflation should rise as unemployment falls has proven a less than reliable model to understand and predict labour wage and inflation dynamics in the past decade an alternative but well known explanation for what is keeping wage and price growth subdued is this the globalising of markets has attracted an influx of cheap labour creating an over supply in the global economy capital in a search to maximize profit has been directed when possible to places where labour is abundant and cheapest when cheap labour can t be utilized mostly due to business models that depend on local or more sophisticated labour automation takes place in order to sustain profitability instead 6 unemployment data on tap today the arrangement leads to a set of circumstances whereby although nominally full employment is achieved labour is underutilized wages don t grow consequently dragging on other areas such as consumption investment and savings there is still hope from policy boffins that the described phenomenon will prove transient and that the outlook for wage growth and all the areas it impacts will progressively improve of course it won t be remedied today but employment numbers released this morning will contribute to the evolving narrative the australian economy is expected to have added 15k jobs last month enough to keep the unemployment rate to around 5 per cent with traders pricing that the next move from the rba will be a cut a pull back in the aud or further falls in acg bond yields may be what to watch for today 7 if fomc is dovish then markets can stay bullish as far as the australian dollar goes it ll be more determined by us dollar activity and speculation regarding the us china trade war beyond all else in the short term case in point the aud has pulled back slightly this morning after the us dollar rallied following the release of january s fomc meeting minutes as far as the minutes go they have been well received in markets so far in essence nothing too surprising has been communicated by the fed in their minutes they confirm ultimately the cautiously optimistic but explicitly dovish stance the central bank adopted at the january meeting though the seemingly inexorably downgrades to forward earnings will inhibit sentiment on wall street for now an accommodative fed is giving traders the permission to take risk and search for yield 8 market watch market highlights spi futures up 4 points at about 6 30am aedt aud flat at 71 63 us cents on wall st at 2 36pm dow 0 2 s p 500 0 2 nasdaq flat in europe stoxx 50 0 6 ftse 0 7 cac 0 7 dax 08 spot gold 0 2 to us1343 83 an ounce at 1 47pm new york time brent crude 1 to us67 13 a barrel us oil 1 8 to us57 10 a barrel iron ore 1 4 to us88 00 a tonne dalian iron ore 0 4 to 624 yuan lme aluminium 0 7 to us1868 a tonne lme copper 1 4 to us6405 a tonne 2 year yield us 2 50 australia 1 70 5 year yield us 2 47 australia 1 72 10 year yield us 2 65 australia 2 10 germany 0 10 us australia 10 year yield gap at 6 38am aedt 55 basis points this column was produced in commercial partnership between the sydney morning herald the age and ig

have delivered what we promised to the market in the first full year following our ipo among our most recent achievements we met our production guidance for all metals after very strong fourth quarter performance we will be paying the installation license for our greenfield project aripuana and we are excited to have started the construction of the project at the end of 2018 as we published on january 15th our 2019 guidance for zinc contained in concentrate is higher 3 than 2018 when consider the mid range of the guidance we are confident that during 2019 we will be able to reap the benefits from the mine development initiatives carried out during 2018 mostly in cerro lindo mine in addition to production increase we are also forecasting a higher capex given the already mentioned aripuana project later we will give you more details on our guidance on the financial front we have renegotiated part of our debt to extend maturities at the lower cost we have returned capital to our shareholders by distributing 80 million in share premium and recently we announced 30 million share buyback program that is already under execution as a result of the reduced cash generation in 2018 we are announcing now a dividend payment of 70 million on march 28 2019 with the record date on march 14 we have recently announced that our board of directors has approved the appointment of rodrigo menck to succeed mario bertoncini as nexa s as cfo from march 1st menck will be replacing mario menck is an executive with more than 20 years of experience in finance treasury structured finance and capital markets he worked for more than 10 years in banks such as bankboston westlb citi and bnp paribas he was also structured finance manager and shared services director for braskem a brazilian company he joined nexa in 2016 as head of treasury and investor relations where he led our team in the restructuring of our debt long term and short term and he carried out other different initiatives menck was also directly involved in the company s ipo and his current position at nexa s is the head of m a advertisement advertisement finally i would like to remind you that we maintain our focus on financial discipline sound capital structure and low leverage we believe it will be essential to support the current and future growth of our company most important nexa is continuously embracing best practice in terms of environment emissions water consumption dams and safety standards we also believe in working together with our local communities in order to promote its economic and social development please now move to slide five here we will be addressing market conditions on average zinc went down 19 in the fourth quarter of 2018 when compared to the same quarter of 2017 and the average price was 2 631 per ton when comparing the full year of 2018 with full year of 2017 the average price was only 1 higher however the market dynamic was completely different in 2017 the price had an upward trend throughout the year as the fundamentals were growing stronger in 2018 there was a downward trend although the fundamentals were also strong and metal stocks decreased to all time lows the continuous trade war between china and the us negatively impacted market confidence and sentiment as a consequence of this price went down for 2019 we highlight three key topics first environmental protection in china there s still the main question mark for the zinc price how much this will affect the balance of supply and demand the smelters are struggling to restart or keep production under the new regulation we believe it can result in another year of market debts ph and therefore pushing the price even lower second concentrate balance it is expected to be at the surplus as the smelter consumption remains low and new mine operations are expected to ramp up during the year there s a positive trend for treatment charge that are already increased in the spot market this is positive for nexa as we are still new buyers of concentrates it s important to say that we do not believe as some experts mining production in china will grow in 2019 because of the same environmental restrictions we mentioned before advertisement advertisement third the behavior of zinc price will be directly related to the development of the us china trade talks and in the fed s indications of a slower increase in interest rates about copper and led price they had similar behaviors as zinc price along the fourth quarter of 2018 volatility was mainly caused by the uncertainties related to the trading war now i m going to pass to mario bertoncini who will discuss our results mario please mario antonio bertoncini senior vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you tito ph turning on to page six we discuss our mining performance in the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 as usual let me remind you that we convert our production by metal to a zinc equivalent basis using full year 2018 lme prices in order to present comparable figures as we had anticipated at the beginning of last year our mining production in 2018 would increase throughout the quarters given our plans on mining development particularly in cerro lindo mine the zinc equivalent production in nexa s mining operations totaled 150 000 tons in fourth quarter of 18 10 higher compared to the previous quarter as mentioned in cerro lindo the mine development program supported higher production in the last quarter of 18 with higher treated ore and zinc concentrate advertisement advertisement when comparing our mining production throughout this year we have consistently increased our zinc equivalent production since first quarter of this year having reached a new level of production that s prepared us to achieve our guidance for this year that will be discussed later production on a zinc equivalent basis totaled 556 000 tons during 2018 as a whole down 2 6 compared to 571 000 tons recorded in 2017 at the bottom right part of this page we have our mining cash cost after by product credits that increased by 0 15 ph to 0 31 per pound in the fourth quarter of 18 taking a more careful look on this 0 15 ph of delta we will note that 0 17 is due to lower credit of by products given the decrease on lme prices during this period and 0 03 per pound from higher operating costs mainly in peru primarily driven by higher development cost out of these two factors our cost performance was as planned and efficient please let s move on to the slide seven where we present our smelting performance our smelters performed very well in 2018 having growing production on the second half of the year compared to the first half stabilizing production at full capacity in practical terms the sales of metallic zinc and zinc oxide in 2018 were 4 higher than the previous year totaling 617 000 tons driven by this stable production during the year cajamarquilla that was impacted in 2017 by that unusual rains and floods in peru sold 88 000 tons in the strong fourth quarter of last year with sales 4 up from the last quarter of 17 and also the third quarter of 18 in the full year cajamarquilla sold 333 000 tons of metallic zinc 6 higher than the previous year 17 tres marias and juiz de fora maintained that performance close to full capacity cash cost net of by product credits decreased by 18 to 1 10 per pound a delta of 0 24 in the fourth quarter of 18 compared to the same period of the previous year this delta in cost is mainly due to lower raw material costs driven by lower zinc prices and the brazilian currency devaluation that in this case impacted positively our smelters in brazil moving on to slide eight here on the slide eight we present our revenues and ebitda per segment as usual please note that these segmented sales only sales not ebitda includes intersegment revenues or some overlap that will be offset on a consolidated sales presented on the following page revenues for the mining segment was down 24 in the fourth quarter of 18 versus the same quarter in the previous year mainly due to lower metal prices and reduced volumes in cerro lindo these impacted our adjusted mining ebitda which fell 52 year over year reaching 88 million in the fourth quarter of 18 in addition to lower revenues we incurred higher costs driven by development costs as already mentioned bringing ebitda margin for mining to 31 advertisement advertisement in mining when comparing full year of 18 against 17 adjusted ebitda fell 18 to 430 million reaching a 37 ebitda margin for the smelting division despite the 17 drop in revenues in the fourth quarter of 18 compared to the same quarter in the previous year our adjusted ebitda increased 31 driven by higher sales volumes lower operating costs and tax credits recorded in brazil in the fourth quarter the adjusted ebitda margin for smelting was up 300 basis points to 9 year over year smelting revenues for the full year of 18 increased 4 while adjusted ebitda was up 14 compared to 2017 in 2018 mining accounted for 71 of our ebitda and smelting for the remaining 29 let s move on to page nine where we talk about our financial results our consolidated revenues totaled 2 5 billion in the full year of 18 up 2 compared to previous year in last quarter of 18 sales went down 17 compared to the same quarter of previous year impacted by lower base metals prices only partially offset by higher metal sales as already presented during the full year of 18 adjusted ebitda was down 9 as a result of higher costs as explained before resulting on a consolidated ebitda margin of 24 compared to 27 of the previous year on the last quarter our consolidated ebitda went down 41 particularly given the impact on net revenues of that quarter on the upper right part of this slide we present our capex breakdown we spent 137 million in the capex in the last quarter of last year totaling 300 million in the full year of 18 all the details on the capex will be explained in our guidance section on the bottom right part of this page is our sound operational free cash flow before debt principal and distribution resulting in 13 of cash conversion before expansion capex as we announced it last month we are in a smooth transition where i m transferring my responsibilities as nexa cfo to rodrigo menck by the end of this month menck is fully engaged in our process priorities and agenda and i m sure nexa financial team is in very good hands i ask menck now to present our considerations on capital structure and guidance and would like to thank you all for the trust opportunity to interact and work together wish you the best for menck nexa and all of you thank you rodrigo nazareth menck incoming senior vicepresident of finance and chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thank you mario regarding our debt profile and cash position we continue to report a healthy balance sheet with extended debt profile and low leverage the average maturity of our total debt was 6 1 years with an average cost of 4 8 per annum in us dollar terms we have continued to implement initiatives in 2018 in order to reduce debt cost and extend maturities on the pie chart you can see the debt breakdown both in terms of modality and currency almost three fourths come from debt and capital markets being the remaining amount compounded by banks ecas and bndes in terms of currency 91 of our total debt is denominated in us dollars and 9 in reais we have reported a net debt balance of 303 million as a result of a cash balance of 1 1 billion versus a total debt of 1 4 billion resulting in a net leverage of 0 5 times net debt to ebitda a comfortable position to move ahead with our higher capex plan guided for 2019 on the next slides we will discuss guidance for production and capex in more details please move to slide 11 i would like to start reiterating that we met our 2018 mining production guidance for all metals driven by a production recovery in the fourth quarter 18 as planned and our smelting segment had a strong performance throughout the year reaching the top of the range of our sales volume guidance for 2019 as tito mentioned before we expect zinc mining production to expand approximately 3 versus 2018 considering the mid range of the guidance presented herein nexa s main assumptions for such increase are first higher treated ore volumes compensating lower grades already forecasted by technical reports second stabilized production throughout 2019 at levels achieved in the fourth quarter of 18 in the cerro lindo operation which operates now close to its 21 000 ton per day processing capacity as a benefit from mining development initiatives carried out during 2018 third stabilization of cerro pasco mines production after changes in processes and additional safety procedures that were implemented along 2018 and finally productivity gains in brazil mainly with the implementation of an additional shift in vazante increasing operating hours in the mine advertisement advertisement on the smelter side we expect relatively stable sales volumes year over year considering the mid range of our guidance with a 1 increase in production available for sale key points for 2019 are first a potential slowdown of the cajamarquilla plant during the implementation of the jarosite process conversion during the third quarter of 19 despite this potential short term production slowdown we expect a 3 gain in recovery rates once the process is fully implemented and second productivity gains in tres marias from increased use of silicate mix as well as in juiz de fora with higher participation of secondary feed materials please move to page 12 where we talk about capex and opex here on slide 12 we present our guidance for capex and expenses on mineral exploration and project development 2018 capex reached 300 million in 2018 as already mentioned including 137 million invested in the fourth quarter of 18 capex was overall 40 million above our 2018 guidance of 260 million as we decided to expedite some investments in the end of the year being approximately 8 million related to magistral and 7 million related to vazante in addition to 14 million of operating expenses related to the atacocha and el porvenir integration which were reclassified as capex as well as higher sustaining capex in cerro lindo due to mine development initiatives in 2019 we are increasing our capex guidance to 420 million this includes initial investments in the aripuana project in the amount of 140 million we estimate spending approximately 35 of the total 392 million of the projects this year excluding aripuana our planned investments amounts approximately 280 million similar to last year therefore nearly half of the 420 million will be directed to expansion continuously focusing on brownfield life of mine extension and our greenfield projects pipeline advertisement advertisement aside from aripuana just mentioned main projects in 2019 are vazante mine deepening with 24 million and the jarosite conversion process at the cajamarquilla smelter with 24 million as well both projects have been extensively discussed in the past years in mineral exploration we continue our efforts to increase reserves and resources aiming an average life of mine of 12 years for our current operations our minerals exploration expense guidance of 75 million considers 36 million to brownfield and 33 million to greenfield exploration our project development expense guidance of 53 million includes projects in fel1 and fel2 stages of which 23 million is related to greenfields although impacting ebitda this type of expense is key to develop projects that will support nexa s growth in the coming years finally tito will address our main initiatives for the year tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer thank you menck please move to slide 13 where we highlight some key initiatives for 2019 our operations are always working on improving its efficiency productivity and lower costs this allows us to operate in different market scenarios with the conclusion of vazante s dry stacking project along the year nexa s major mines cerro lindo and vazante which represent 70 of our total production we will be adopting the dry stacking method a process that is much safer and environmental friendly we ll keep working on our greenfield pipeline primarily with the advance of the construction of aripuana s mine and plant which includes contracting main equipment and servicing among others in addition to aripuana we intend to conclude in 2019 fel2 for the magistral and pukaqaqa projects along the year we intend to deliver an updated mineral reserves and resource simulations for vazante atacocha el porvenir morro agudo and shalipayco at our mine segments the main objective is to maintain cerro lindo production stable at full capacity in other words 21 000 tons of run of mine per day vazante also should some improvement in production along the year as it was mentioned before we estimate to reach 97 of zinc recovery rate in cajamarquilla by the end of the year as well as increased usage of secondary raw material in juiz de fora production and increase silicate concentrates in tres marias resulting in a higher productivity in our smelters before we go to the q a session i would like to say a few words about mario bertoncini mario is leaving us for a new professional challenge and i m sure he will be very successful without mario s contribution and work we would not be at the point we are today he had an important role in our ipo as well as in the structuring of our company and i m sure we would not be where we are today without his efforts and contribution thank you mario i wish you good luck and i welcome menck in his new position let s move to the questions questions and answers operator thank you sir we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question today will come from carlos de alba with morgan stanley please go ahead with your question carlos de alba morgan stanley co llc analyst good morning everyone and good afternoon for you guys mario first of all all the best in the new challenges and thank you very much for these few years of working together it was a very good experience so all the best in the future if i may ask about 2019 tito or the rest of the team is there any special sequence in terms of output and i guess cost performance your last year obviously as you just pointed out the second half of the year particularly the fourth quarter was really strong so in order to avoid any surprises are there any comments on the sequence for this year that you may point out and then on brazil given the tragic accident on the tailing dam there do you expect any potential impact in nexa s operations or production clearly vazante moving to dry stacking is a major initiative and i guess the company anticipates to where the industry may be moving forward but are there any comments or considerations that we need to be aware given what happened in brazil tragically thank you tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer thank you carlos i m going to leave to mario to answer the first part of the question about the costs and then i ll answer your question about how we see the future of operations in brazil i mean short term in brazil after the accident of brumadinho mario please mario antonio bertoncini senior vice president finance and chief financial officer carlos thanks for your message regarding production and costs a different from last year what we are planning for this year is a more flat production throughout the quarters we don t see that pattern that we had in these two previous years we are prepared with cerro lindo at full capacity and although that mine is in very good shape we re prepared now to have a more flat production throughout the quarter regarding costs will keep investing in mine development we should expect pattern costs kind of pattern that we saw last year for a while i think a fair assumption is to consider that cost structure since we ll keep investing in mining development particularly in cerro lindo atacocha well and el porvenir tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer i would add to that if we have if everything goes as we expect we should have some gains in productivity as well right so comparing this year with the previous one probable performance will be a little bit better mostly also because we are increasing production in our mines and we should have a slight growth also in our smelters answering the second question about brazil how we see our production being affected or not in 2019 i don t see anything actually directly impacting us you have to remember that our dams in brazil are all of them the operating dams all of them are downstream dams so we do not have any issue about the new regulation that was released at the beginning of this week actually about the upstream dams not being allowed to stay in operations about the dry stacking at vazante we re expecting to have this being ready to be used on the second half which is very positive for us it s positive for our not only for our operations but also for our reputation i would say it s good to be perceived as a company that is actually moving on with a different approach in terms of disposal of inaudible cadence thank you carlos de alba morgan stanley co llc analyst thank you operator and our next question will come from caio ribeiro of credit suisse please go ahead mr ribeiro your line may be muted your line is open sir caio ribeiro credit suisse brasil sa ctvm analyst yes hi good morning everyone and thank you for the opportunity my first question is regarding your expansion projects other than aripuana i just wanted to ask if the timing has changed at all in regards to those other projects and after aripuana what would you envision today to be the project that would be the next priority and whether you would consider carrying out investments in two projects at the same time or wait until aripuana starts up before kicking off investments in another project and then my second question in regards to dividends the latest announcement that nexa made in regards to the 70 million dividend payout for march it comes well above the 2 minimum dividend yield policy that the company has in place right now so i just wanted to see if you would consider revising this dividend policy upwards given the low leverage that the company has right now those are my two questions and also mario i just wanted to wish you the best of luck in your new challenge thanks tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer thank you for the questions about expansions what happened is aripuana is going well we started up at the end of last year we are on track on our contractors with the contractors equipment has already been ordered so we re confident we should finish the construction by the end of 2020 and starting up 2021 what happened about other projects is the following we until a few months ago we were expecting to finish fel3 for shalipayco assuming that we will use the ore mined in shalipayco in the facility in el porvenir so we work most of the time with the concept that we had only to open up the mine and not building the plant the beneficiation plant what happened is when we conclude the fel1 we came to the conclusion that it was much better actually to increase the capacity of the mine in shalipayco and actually work with the possibility to build a new plant there so we are moving on with the fel 2 of shalipayco looking at two possibilities the first one is ok we re going to have an independent project a larger plant a larger mine with a larger plant and it s dependent on el porvenir and there is an variation of those studies where we look at the possibility that before we start production in the shalipayco site we trucked some ore to be used in atacocha it implied a reschedule of shalipayco for at least 10 months which means that we were planning to have the fel3 of shalipayco by sometime 2020 and we are moving to the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021 which means that when we finish the studies of shalipayco we will be finishing magistral studies at the same time if you ask me today what i think about that since we do not want to stockpile the projects we have been saying that for as far as i remember we should actually have to choose in between the development of the shalipayco as a full project i mean mine and plant or magistral as a full project my guess today is that probably magistral will be the preferred one for two reasons the numbers in magistral have been showing much more traction than the shalipayco as an independent project and secondly we ve been saying all the time that we want to have more production of copper so we have to wait and see i think this is going to be a good problem for us to have to choose between the two projects sometimes in the second half of 2020 or the beginning of 2021 in terms of the dividends mario you want to mention something mario antonio bertoncini senior vice president finance and chief financial officer regarding dividends i think first we have paid more than we had announced as a policy but at the same time keeping consistency i think is quite important what we did in this dividend is not that much different from what we did last year when we paid in 2018 right from now on we should keep more or less the same consistency i would say respecting not only the market cap and dividend yield but also the capacity of cash generation the ebitda and the obligations ahead i would say quite well that at this point keeping the track record and building this consistent with the market is even more important than the policy per se tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer and as i like to say all the time we are sticking with our concept of paying 2 what is wrong with the market cap thank you caio ribeiro credit suisse brasil sa ctvm analyst perfect that s very clear if i might just have one quick follow up tito i imagine that these developments with shalipayco they might impact the returns of the project as a whole but when you run the analysis do you still view the implied irr of this project above the minimum return that you would establish for a new project and above your cost of capital tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer yes yes all the projects will be analyzed based on the minimum hurdle rate of 15 mario antonio bertoncini senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer yeah we have not changed anything and actually when you talk about shalipayco we re saying that we re seeing a different project because it s going to be larger than the one we were talking before thank you caio ribeiro credit suisse brasil sa ctvm analyst perfect understood thank you operator our next question will come from orest wowkodaw of scotiabank please go ahead orest wowkodaw scotia capital inc analyst hi good morning everybody two questions for me first of all can you provide any cost guidance for 2019 obviously costs were very good on a per pound basis in 2018 i m just wondering whether you anticipate those unit costs to move up in 2019 and then secondly just wondering if there was any impact from the recent truck drivers strike in peru and whether that had any impact on your operations thanks tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer hi orest thanks for your questions starting from the second one no no impact at all on the drivers strike in peru we haven t had any impact and we don t see any impact for us orest wowkodaw scotia capital inc analyst great tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer regarding the cost to guidance we haven t provided the cost guidance for nexa but what i can tell you is first if we divide cost in three main fronts let s assume first the operating costs per se right referring particular on mining here we should expect a flat operating costs for the company on a per unit basis some productivity gains we should expect as we grow in production technical difficulty as we produce more we should technical difficulty total costs or kind of half of that total cost the second aspect is that costs that are not operational per se and related particularly on the development cost mining development and we are budgeting and expecting to spend in mine development pretty much the same amounts we spent last year we ll keep developing the mining fronts of particularly cerro lindo and pasco and also vazante orest wowkodaw scotia capital inc analyst okay tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer and the third aspect in costs that we have to pay attention is exogenous one ph is the impact on foreign exchange rate on our costs this is a low impact in peru since we are much more exposed to us dollars as you know there we pay in salaries only salaries on wages the workforce accounted for 17 18 of our total costs but in brazil it s different in brazil 80 83 of our costs are in brl brazilian reais and based on how we evolve fx can have impact on our cost side orest wowkodaw scotia capital inc analyst okay thank you very much mario and good luck operator the next question will come from thiago lofiego of bradesco bbi please go ahead with your question thiago lofiego bradesco sa ctvm analyst hi thank you first of all mario best of luck in this new career phase wish you all the best i have two questions the first one on capital allocation what s the rationale behind the canceling of the atacocha delisting especially considering your low level of debt does it mean that we should not expect this delisting to happen let s say in the next year or so or even new projects eventually delisting should we not wait expect that to happen the second question about the zinc market what s your view on concentrate prices from here and also we ve seen tcs pressured by some logistics difficulties at townsville port so what s your outlook for treatment charges from here as well thank you tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer thank you for your questions about the capital location on why we gave up the delisting of atacocha has much more to do with the volatility we were seeing at the end of the year at the beginning of this year meaning that we should we would come back as soon as we feel comfortable about that it s a priority for us but it s not a primary item in the first item in our list so we have been very conservative in terms of allocation of capital our main priority has to do with the development of our capex our projects and seemed to us to that when we announced that we ll start a process of this was a good opportunity but given this volatility we ve decided to stop it which doesn t mean that depending how the market behaves the next few months we will come back to that ok it s just a tactical decision let s put this way in terms of the zinc market we haven t seen many differences in between what we would say three to four months ago and what we are seeing today even when you mention that we may see china is slowing down a little bit in terms of the general market demand for zinc is still there and supply is not there at all metal stocks were dropping along the last three months and actually recovered a little bit the last two weeks two to three weeks which has to do with the holidays in china so we need to wait and see what s going to happen in the next two to three weeks what is reflecting in the market right now is the fact that the tcs has to do with the lack of supply of concentrate in the chinese market which is making actually the tcs moving up i ll tell you what we ve seen deals done in between 200 and 220 in peru in the last three weeks some people mentioned that there were deals done around 250 but it seems to us that the tcs the benchmark should be remain around in between 210 220 which is really good when you compare with last year s which was around 140 per ton one thing that s important to observe the zinc price being where they are today in between 2 600 and 2 700 is still a very strong price showing that what we ve been saying along the year the two years is there it is still there we have to regret the fact that the potential trade war and the commercial the trade factors the perception about the global economy being affected trade war affected mostly the prices along the last year but if we see this situation changing based on the negotiations that are being carried out by the us and china we may actually see price coming back again as we saw in the first quarter of last year we have to just wait and see but we re still very confident about that thank you thiago lofiego bradesco sa ctvm analyst thank you operator the next question will come from alex hacking of citi please go ahead alexander hacking citigroup global markets inc analyst hi yes good morning i just wanted to follow up on the tc rcs i got a little confused on the answer are you saying that the tc rcs you expect to move up this year or to stay relatively stable and then i guess second question any change to the terms of the tc rcs in terms of payables and escalators and things like that and then thirdly just again related to the smelting business has there been any change to the regional premiums that you see locally in latin america in terms of the zinc price thank you tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer thank you for your questions let me clarify the tcs we were seeing the reference price for the last year was around 140 per ton spot market was around it as well in the last month or so spot price went up to 200 220 and we are seeing the possibility for the benchmark be around 220 as well without any changes in the free zinc and any changes in the escalation so we would not see anything different from that alexander hacking citigroup global markets inc analyst okay thanks for that clarification tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer thank you alexander hacking citigroup global markets inc analyst and then on the regional any changes on the regional premiums tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer no no actually premiums have been very flat i mean if you see it up and down around 10 to 15 which is not relevant at all alexander hacking citigroup global markets inc analyst okay thank you tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer they re stable they have been stable for i would say the last nine months until then they were going up so they ve been stable for the last nine months yes thank you alexander hacking citigroup global markets inc analyst thank you operator operator instructions our next question today will come from oscar cabrera with cibc please go ahead oscar cabrera cibc world markets inc analyst thank you operator and good morning everyone i d also like to echo my thanks to mario for all his help during our initiation of coverage mario thank you very much and all the best in the new challenge and then also like to welcome rodrigo into the team we look forward to working with you and so in terms of the questions your mineral exploration budget of 75 million i know you want to increase your reservoir s life but how many more years do you think we have to be at these levels to achieve that and then along the same line on your project development capex of 53 million how should we think about this number as we move to 2020 2021 do you need to keep it at those levels to maintain the cost on the operations tito botelho martins junior president and chief executive officer oscar thank you for your questions very good ones i would say about the exploration expenses i would say the following what happened is we have spent a lot of money and we know that mostly in trying to extend the life of our mines and the results have been very positive ones so we ve set a target for us we want to reach a minimum 12 years reserves for each of our mines which implies that we should be spending enough capital until we reach this point but we are not too far from that if you look at our track record along the last three years you will see that it s possible to be achievable in the couple of years so we are confident we will do it so part of the value we are spending right now the 17 million has to do with that i should say probably almost half of it of course we want to keep investing in greenfield exploration and some of brownfield as well has not directed to do with life of mine this has much more to do with the areas that surrounds our current operations so my guess is in the short and medium term we should see this number coming down a little bit not too much but should come down and the same applies to the development projects why is that we have a pipeline of seven projects and all of them actually now six because aripuana is under development all of now were pretty much almost at the same stage so as i said before today when we reach the point that we have to choose in between for example magistral and shalipayco the amount that we will be spending for the products that will be in our shelf will be dramatically reduced so i would say that we re in a transition time for the next two years or three years of at most we will be spending more with the projects but the trends are that we would be able to start to refine the use of capital in new projects so it s just a transition time and let s be able and we assume that we should be able to enjoy it as long as our cash generation is positive one some of the analysts were saying you are showing a negative free cash flow for the next year it s true but you have to consider that first we are still underleveraged and secondly we are investing in growth i think the important thing here has to do we re talking about projects and exploration expense that you bring to us a future growth in the next five years that s where we want to be we have a very conservative approach about those expenses but at the same time we have a very not say aggressive but consistent brand to grow thank you oscar cabrera cibc world markets inc analyst thank you very much if i may a second question in your presentation on the slide 10 you say that you wanted to continue to analyze opportunities to keep reducing debt cost and extend the average maturity the maturities that i see here that you disclose are not that great but can you elaborate a little bit more on this what are you looking to do with this rodrigo nazareth menck incoming senior vicepresident of finance and chief financial officer hello oscar this is menck speaking here given that our debt is pretty much coming from debt capital markets the only short tenure debt we have is the nexa peru bond that matures in 2023 at this point in time we don t see economic advantage in having a liability management transaction on it but this is always a possibility should the market price covers allow us aside from that only in case we have some project related financing along the years which come with the larger tenures and then will push this a bit more forward right but other than that the bank market is not lending lines for that longer terms and we also don t have that much for bank lines only 200 million out of the 1 4 billion i don t know if i covered what you wanted oscar cabrera cibc world markets inc analyst no that s it thank you very much rodrigo nazareth menck incoming senior vicepresident of finance and chief financial officer you are welcome operator operator instructions having no

impact of the tax act enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 our effective tax rate was 14 0 and 19 9 for the full year 2018 and 2017 respectively the decrease in our effective income tax rate is due

the same west that was protesting the sieges imposed by the syrian army and the humanitarian suffering it caused is now imposing a siege on the syrian people and hoping that their suffering will lead to political concessions you condemned the regime for using starvation and sieges and now you are doing it you condemned the regime for using indiscriminate bombing and now you are imposing indiscriminate sanctions this is disgusting and criminal and no western official involved should feel good about themselves the same countries who claimed to care about the syrian people and speak on their behalf supported insurgents tried to overthrow the government and now are trying to starve syrians that the syrian government behaved abhorrently does not justify the international intervention that followed and in fact the intervention helped cause these crimes flooding the country with fighters and explosives and undermining a state are sure to provoke a defensive response by that state by the people who depend on it for safety employment and the basic services that modern citizens have come to expect the sanctions of course did no damage to the regime in fact they strengthened it as is normally the case because the population became more dependent on the government for its survival and less connected to the rest of the world these economic measures did not put pressure on syrian elites they had the same effect on millions of syrians living in government held areas as did the government s besieging of hundreds of thousands in insurgent held areas poor and middle class syrians lost their electricity supplies health care and other goods and services their quality of life deteriorated their days being taken up with basic survival rather than investing in their dreams or future let alone thinking about civil society or politics their sons died protecting government areas from insurgents who brought only chaos prices rose salaries lost value supply chains were disrupted and the country was deliberately de developed losing decades of progress sanctions perpetuate the power of the regime in syria and make people depend on it exclusively for survival middle eastern states like syria were already weak even before the sanctions many arab states are victims of what political economist sara roy called de development she referred to gaza but this applies to syria iraq libya yemen palestine and is currently happening in iran as well as venezuela infrastructure destroyed social ties and connections torn apart life expectancy goes down populations flee and especially young men die or run away american imperialist wars have destroyed or prevented arab development argues professor ali kadri he defines sovereignty as the right of working people to determine the conditions of their livelihood using this frame of reference it is clear that wars and sanctions have destroyed sovereignty sovereignty is not just defending yourself it s keeping your working class inside controlling your economy controlling your ability to make plans and determine your destiny a state cannot be secure when it is being weakened socially and economically its people will flee abroad or they will struggle to pursue only basic subsistence not education or employment or their dreams and it becomes easy for external actors or dangerous movements to take advantage of them so middle eastern states were never secure they were always under pressure they lacked national security and the populations lacked security about how they would be educated or employed in syria thanks to the uprising and the government s response to it the garb of a republic has been stripped away and the feudal nature of the syrian state has become more apparent now we see a king who relies upon his lords to raise private armies to protect him in exchange for the privileges he bestows upon them all countries have dissatisfied populations with grievances but in the third world as we see in syria or venezuela the west and specifically the us use these grievances to intervene ostensibly on behalf of the people but in fact the most reactionary nihilistic obscurantist and dangerous forces receive support from outside and they destroy the country socially economically and physically which is the goal then the west comes in with solutions based on sect or ethnic group that implant a permanent conflict into the system middle eastern states are weakened or destroyed through wars or capitalism capitalism doesn t work the same way everywhere korea has a different function than syria there is nothing to extract from syria but a war in syria can create billions in arms contracts or change the geopolitical situation in a way that makes things profitable elsewhere or serves western interests so the value of the middle east is the accumulation of capital through war it is easy to do this in the middle east since states there are weak and lack sovereignty us control over the global economy makes it easy for it to reduce a country s sovereignty so that it lacks the power to determine its own course as they are trying to do with iran venezuela and syria today the continuous american wars have led to the us military surrounding and strangling middle eastern states more and more as kadri writes wars dislocate workers and farmers and remove national resources from even potential political control by national working classes middle eastern states exist in a permanent condition of american wars preparing for american wars enduring them or emerging from american wars and dealing with the consequences of those wars people cannot think of struggling or seizing control of their fate when they are being deliberately impoverished by the americans middle eastern states are under constant assault with outsiders calling for their demise people have been losing their sovereignty thanks to preparing for wars with israel or the us or each other the constant threat of war kadri writes justifies the rise of the class in power and the security apparatus that sustains arab regimes it has justified and strengthened dictatorships the arab ruling classes use this as an excuse to tighten their grip on society and they use the state as a way to accumulate resources for themselves the constant threat of war also means you cannot plan for the long term or invest and develop for the long term it is not just that middle eastern states have bad policies or are dictatorships which they are it is that they lack control over their policies these states are severely restricted in their options between the threat of war and the assault of neoliberalism oil revenue helped relieve some of these problems but oil is also the cause of western imperialism and wars that people in the region endure those states not directly involved in conflicts are the neighbors of those states in conflict and so they still suffer the consequences of refugee flow the destruction of trade and economic ties the radicalization of their population and they all become more fragile as revolutionary pan arab causes have disappeared we see the cooptation of elites into global capitalism and into the interests of the west or the embrace of pan islamic causes it is important to keep gulf states stable they have a huge purchasing power and we need them to provide us with essential resources but purchasing power in places like syria yemen iraq was not so important and western interests were better served by weakening them for some powers there is more value in the results of violence than there is in stability in the middle east people in the middle east in africa do not produce they lack the right machines to give them value so their value is in our wars some countries are of value because they produce iphones automobiles shoes while others have value through war and the production of weapons and the more they are destroyed the more capital accumulates for some this constant threat of conflict and destruction means people cannot focus on anything beyond survival they lose their sovereignty and become enslaved every state in the middle east that tries to set an independent course of development for itself is destroyed western sanctions are a manifestation of a morally bankrupt strategy and the refusal to recognize reality at every step of the way the west has escalated the war prevented solutions and made things worse rather than engaging with the government to find solutions it declared the government illegitimate and appointed a group of corrupt useless and unrepresentative individuals as the representatives of the syrian people while supporting insurgents the west refused to look at solutions that did not involve regime change so america and the europeans opposed local ceasefires and reconciliations and ordered the un not to support them so the only experiments with potential were ignored when they could have helped but this was seen as helping the regime win well the regime won and you were not able to influence anything instead it was further isolated and its creative officials who pursued peaceful and negotiated local solutions were marginalized at every step of the conflict the west undermined potential solutions and prolonged the conflict with the former un envoy facilitating this the west clung to the hope that the threat to the state would force it to offer concessions so it tolerated or even supported half the country collapsing to insurgents nusra and isis hoping that this would give the west leverage to pressure the regime but it did not and now that this has failed the west wants to punish syrians once again by imposing a siege on them it is as if they are trying to bring the country to its knees like iraq in the 90s or venezuela today the west s latest obsessions are targeting syrian businessmen and punishing the syrian government for its land redevelopment laws such as the famous law 10 i have yet to find a western diplomat who has read the law or its amendments let alone understands it they appear instead to be deliberately misinterpreting it the law is dangerous because it is neoliberal and adversely affects the poor in the context when syria desperately needs housing for the poor but it is mostly a typical land redevelopment law and it was written by sunnis it is not sectarian it will benefit middle and upper class sunnis at the expense of poor sunnis but it will also affect poor alawites and druze and whoever else was living in destroyed slums as with much of what is written about syria absolutely ignorant journalists diplomats and think tank analysts make uneducated assertions based on their emotional and ideological bias law 10 s origin is in fact in post war germany it seems these laws are the result of modern warfare which destroys urban areas the problem in syria is that it had massive informal settlements slums where people did not formally own their houses or apartments so when these areas were destroyed during the war hundreds of thousands of families did not have the usual legal deeds of ownership so when the regime drew up neoliberal and utopian redevelopment schemes that were creating middle and upper income housing in a country desperately lacking housing for poor people it became clear that law 10 would not adequately compensate the residents of these slums this was not sectarian or political it was just neoliberal and capitalist and the result of poor planning western officials chose not to engage with the government on these legitimate concerns but instead interpreted it as some kind of anti sunni or anti refugee law many of the residents of these areas will become wealthier it s just that the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer these things don t bother western policy makers when it comes to their own countries but they discovered a sudden love for syria s poor people if they happened to be sunni and pro opposition and so as a result they decided to impose further sanctions on syria as well as businessmen effectively potentially criminalizing all syrian businessmen the west could have sent western experts on urban planning or reconstruction to suggest wiser courses of actions but they insisted that the regime is illegitimate and everything it does is illegitimate and motivated by evil so they chose to punish it the russians lacking an ideology and avoiding imperialism in pursuit of pragmatism were much more realistic but they were new to these kinds of adventures and they are still getting to know syria and sometimes it seems russians on the ground are more concerned with taking pictures of themselves succeeding so they can send them back to the chain of command in moscow rather than actually succeeding and syrians have been very effective at manipulating russians to serve their own personal interests we should not expect to see a political process the geneva process was always based on an irrational fantasy but now even though it s obvious to everyone governments still stubbornly cling to it and even if a constitutional committee is finally formed this constitution will never be enacted the syrian government views it as an attempt to weaken the state and plant its enemies within and anyway the problem in syria was not the constitution but that the constitution was not being implemented and syrians are hungry and tired and nobody cares about these things anyway except western diplomats syrians are desperate and people might soon come out on the streets regardless of what side they belong to loyalists are no longer loyal in syria and if nothing changes they will not send their sons to fight on behalf of the government next time but they might be part of an internal fight loyalists in aleppo and elsewhere are boiling in rage over checkpoints extorting from them yet while even loyalists hate the regime now there is no conversation about how to reform all this anger could easily explode just as it did in tunisia in 2010 all it might take is one security officer slapping a former soldier in the face and the fire could start in his speech two days ago assad was transparent with the population inside that the war is not over that things will get worse and that the government can do little for them on the other hand he did not introduce any solutions for participation inclusion or return assad had some points but he has very few solutions refugees will not come back why would anyone return to syria for military service sanctions poverty there is no hope the dream of every family is to send their sons outside of syria families rely on men who are working and now they have to worry that even a 38 year old will be called for military duty the government and its allies celebrated their victory too early and never expressed a vision for an organized peace the syrian government thinks it won the war but it has done nothing to help the nation recover and by this i don t mean cooperating with the west or hopeless fantasies like the geneva process but articulating a vision and reassuring all syrians inside and outside that there is a future and that they are welcome the country needs genuine reform even if it is poor reform will bring resources if the government announces that the citizen whoever he is is part of the rebuilding process the money will come in if it shows openness the money will come in but instead the mindset of the government in former opposition areas that are newly accessible is worse than before the government is not in a reconciliatory mood it is in a victorious mode i won the war and now you shut up and eat shit this victor s mentality is the most dangerous thing in syria today the government does not seem to recognize that unless things change there is no future the current state machinery is like a volkswagen beatle from the 70s while the state needs a modern mercedes engine the state in syria is archaic ancient rotten there is no socialism in syria no capacity building process just the last vestige of socialism giving people barely enough to eat but not to improve they are simply surviving it s a failure when you get to that point when you have become a feudal system where the state is the one source of livelihood for people the state becomes more powerful people depend on it to live the regime in syria has proven that it is capable of continuing like this for a long time it won t fall from sanctions it will just be a very poor country with a strong central state an open reconstruction process creates a new bourgeoise and new capital the state does not control sanctions only serves the so called regime today in syria there is no space for intellectuals and economic life is stagnating there is no transparency and no trust between the street and the state the state has not declared what is the role of the citizen in the post war phase syria has no history of having conversations about anything not on political reform not on religion and identity and not on why it s stupid to have 8 children per family and assad has just effectively admitted in his speech that reconstruction will not happen the government did produce a plan but it is a top down centralized baathist vision of syria they say the right things but have no tools to implement anything and they act as if syria is a normal country before the crisis they have no vision for the new syria that exists today after the crisis but at least they produced a new document and its clear they expect to cooperate with undp and yet the government makes life hell for international organizations trying to help we see a return to the 80s when syria was ruled by fear and force the current ruling mechanism is not supportive of discussions about the future and most ministries do not care about the people despite this there remains a dedicated bureaucracy in the syrian state but state employees are just trying to survive and hunger produces corruption and apathy the war economy is coming to an end there are less things to loot no sieges to profit from less scrap from destroyed towns to sell we see more competition for smaller pieces of the pie smuggling remains profitable and will continue to be so since the sanctions have criminalized businessmen there are more clashes between gangsters and militiamen the sanctions will deny these men alternative sources of employment and they will have to live by the gun at the same time we see the syrian state coming back with a vengeance and arresting loyalist militiamen for committing crimes while trying to end the militia phenomenon and force them to integrate into the army and we see the state zealously preventing too much outside influence whether russian or iranian the syrian state like other some other arab states has emerged stronger after 2011 the state as a territorial entity meaning sykes picot rather than being challenged after 2011 was reconfirmed but inside these borders there was a collapse of the post colonial state the system was challenged damaged or destroyed now we see a fragile center that is militarized the new states with their empty nationalist rhetoric do not project norms they have no values nothing political parties are dead a security regime is in control of a massively fragmented society in syria and iraq the center has to accept to deal with non state actors despite attempts to renew it in syria the baath cannot return as an ideology only as a structure of control it lacks resources and nobody is redistributing resources or if they are it s from the poor to the rich if we look at syria more recently we see that since 2011 syrian nationalism has been shrinking it s not about inclusiveness like arab nationalism it s a narrow right wing identity that excludes entire segments of the population much like the lebanese christian embrace of a fictitious phoenician identity included in this new identity is a resentment of most other arabs and especially palestinians there used to be mobilization and politicization because of israel but this stopped as increasing neoliberalism corrupted all ideologies and the syrian state abandoned the baath party during the 80s as the baath felt like a burden the syrians ended up training and arming people but they were not politicized this started under hafez but bashar finished it off it helped create the insurgency they would face in 2011 and now with a massively mobilized armed population that fought for the government but also fought in order to steal refrigerators and televisions and cows from duma or daraya and lacks all ideology we can imagine further instability we see more autocratic regimes emerging with empty nationalist rhetoric as in egypt and syria with the role of security increasing nationalism in the days of nasser had content now it is bankrupt counterrevolutions in the middle east are not linked with a specific axis regimes resist and they fall back on their international backers and the opposition describes it as a counterrevolution this is as true in syria which relied on iran and russia as it is in egypt which relied on the us saudis and emiratis the us promoted the counterrevolution in egypt and the revolution in syria counterrevolution is also a regional dynamic the saudis and the uae sent 21 billion dollars to sisi after the coup and the uae backed the media campaign for him the government s allies succeeded in preventing state collapse and restoring syrian sovereignty over much of the country but they failed to improve anything in syria they could not produce a single professional and disciplined military unit they could not influence the government to reform politically or economically or to be more humane when dealing with prisoners to extend a welcoming hand to people who lived in former opposition areas the amount of work needed to help places like east ghota and the former opposition areas of the south is huge but huge constraints are put on ngos they are treated as if they are helping the terrorists but these poor residents don t care about politics anymore they just want to move on with their lives the russians cannot do state building they do not have this colonial legacy to try to come in and improve not that the record of western intervention and conflict resolution has ever led to a lasting peace or stability either and there is no reason to think syria will be otherwise it s a structural reason in the way that peace building takes place and restructuring states takes place america does not really want a stable and sovereign iraq that controls iraq for example it creates constitutions that divide countries and prevent economic sovereignty and lead to future wars or perpetual dependence on foreign aid and support which if lifted will lead to war the next day unlike the us the russians don t push their allies saying we give you this if you do that the russians do not condition things on their allies or they would not have any allies because it s not like they can offer money for very little investment russia achieved a lot in syria but why is russia in syria what is russia doing in middle east it supports the saudis in yemen it offers the saudis weapons it won t give to syria there is no consistent or overarching view of why you are in middle east syrians complain that they are being exploited by russia that russian companies are extracting their resources that russia is gas wealthy while syrians don t have gas in the south russia has empowered former insurgents but it has chosen the wrong local partners and violence is increasing as a result recently in daraa there have been at least 25 security incidents attacks on checkpoints assassinations of security forces members assassinations of at least one mayor who did reconciliations and assassinations of others who worked on reconciliations russia needs to know that the current machinery of the syrian state cannot satisfy any syrian regardless of their political orientation assad has a terrible team of advisors and he needs good advice russia should offer solutions and not ones based on the geneva process russia will not rebuild syria but it could help create the stable and transparent conditions to make people feel safe to return and invest and to encourage countries to come in and invest china does not have the tools on the ground to play a role but for very little money the chinese could offer a substitute for western support china puts money into states but it has no reliable partners in syria it s in china s interests to expand its presence in syria given that it is in a mortal struggle with the us russia cannot offer money so it is irrelevant at the financial level but the chinese can substitute the lack of western aid if it is not a western led process then syrian reconstruction costs do not have to be high public infrastructure could be rebuilt for little the syrian government s greatest challenges is itself and it is a more difficult challenge than it faced during the war even before the war the government was struggling to reform when it had very smart people working for it but now its best minds have been removed or left and the system is eating itself the same officials who failed to foresee or prevent the crisis remain in power so how can we expect them to offer solutions for the post crisis period the government committed most of the crimes the west claims it did as it was fighting the insurgency the west was helping that was just as criminal no state will tolerate a threat to its existence and the greater the threat the more the state and its personnel will lash out with brutality and the west that encouraged and supported this insurgency is as responsible as the government that responded to it and despite these crimes the west should support the government because the syrian people need this help and the risk of another collapse or uprising due to the fragility of the syrian state and economy is real we have seen what happens to the region and even to europe when there is instability in syria the west has never defined what the term regime means and it sometimes seems as if it views the entire government down to local municipalities as one evil regime in fact the west should be supporting the institutions of the syrian state to strengthen them and make them more effective the government fears information and is preventing an informed decision making process and they lack the capacity to analyze they are submitting plans for cities that have no residents they have no experts capable of dealing with the recovery the country needs planning in syria now doesn t belong in this century it s not involving the people they need help and advice with these plans from western experts right now it s a mussolini style of planning architects who don t know anything about the world outside syria and who hate the population are trying to plan dream cities and assuming that somehow the money will magically materialize for the fancy futuristic buildings architects and university professors are working day and night to design the future of syrian cities cities that nobody owns cities designed for obedient citizens cities that do not have a civil society cities that do not have homes cities that do not allow people to thrive the worst theories of reconstruction and renderings that feature cities as pieces of land are being made featuring in turn the most atrocious security mind set syria has ever known the government s strategies as well as the west s stubborn cruelty appear to guarantee that syrian suffering will continue the planned utopia for syrian cities is not economically feasible and it is not giving space for people s initiatives and for bottom up approaches syrians are desperately poor and planners are designing cities that look like dubai there isn t even a fire department in syria that can put out fires in towers as tall as they want to build there are no laborers skilled at constructing such modern cities but the planners looked at syria and saw that the formal upper class areas didn t rebel against the state while the informal settlements and poor slums did so they decided to design buildings for the wealthy as if this will produce that class of peaceful and obedient people they are designing cities without people and there is no local capacity to even build these projects if the benefits of reconstruction only go to oligarchs and cronies of the inner circle we will be missing an opportunity to improve stability and ease frustration in the 1980s hafez al assad struck a fragile social contract with elites to help the country recover from the muslim brotherhood insurgency and the government s counterinsurgency campaign but this social contract did not include the syrian people and it did not include those outside the country it was instead imposed on those inside this time syria must strike a new social contract and expand the government s base and those engaged in this contract syria s businessmen have been the regime beneath the regime ruling the country regardless of who is in the government a shadow government resembling the way italian society functions despite a weak and corrupt government syria s prominent businessmen and families did not embrace either side of the conflict openly and largely avoided supporting insurgents or militias they like syria s technocrats wanted change and improvement but they held the official opposition in disdain because it had nothing to offer and threatened to destroy syria they carry with them the institutional memory of the syrian state and society there are syrians inside and outside who have the expertise and technical rigor to provide the right advice to the government but they have no influence and do not represent anybody they should be connected to the traditional elites the conservatives who know how to talk to the government and the islamist trends in syria their family names and reputations bestow influence upon them from all sides and they should be part of an advisory council supporting the syrian president to the fix economy you need functioning institutions rule of law and to open up to the old sunni bourgeoisie to return the syrians in syria are the ones without experience or the capacity except to obey orders you need hope and a lot of money so you have to incentivize the middle class to return why would i return from germany give me hope and a job there is no middle class no purchasing capacity no wealth being generated eighty percent of people are living below the poverty line working class and poor people can exist without legal institutions but a middle class needs legitimacy and legal institutions the new class of warlords do not create jobs they do not produce the communities who had workshops and farms who produced have been destroyed russia must build an independent reconstruction process in syria that has checks and balances to protect it from a corrupt system or nobody will put money in syria russia needs to secure amnesties for syrians to return and it needs to provide enough of a social contract so middle class syrians feel comfortable returning for every dollar the west puts in the syrian middle class will put in ten dollars if it is secure and there are checks and balances and assad will rule a country that belongs in the 21st century this will make syria a major investment center for the chinese and the arab gulf syria is not as difficult to solve financially as egypt with a massive deficit that the international community has to fill but don t talk about returns when it s a few hundred refugee families coming back that s only poor people being added to poor people can you bring back an engineer the government cannot improve while under sanctions it feels under siege threatened its officials thinking only of the desperate struggle for survival their salaries are worthless prices are going up and quality of life is going down if we reduce the existential threat to the state we open the space for the regime s stakeholders to make changes and expand their base so that they too emerge stronger the west has not learned anything but where are the russians who could at least encourage the government to open up and stop alienating potential friends in the international community the russians never used their influence over the government s internal affairs they only focused on military issues and broader strategic agreements such as negotiating with americans israelis jordanians or turks the syrian government did not engage in a lessons learned process did not punish anyone or reward anyone for success or failure the russians meanwhile have relied on corrupt businessmen and brutal warlords in syria to win the war and have empowered them instead of trying to support and improve the government the west only threatened it european diplomats who visited damascus avoided meeting with the government fearing this would legitimize the regime and instead they threatened from their capitals their threats achieved nothing and now they have carried out their threats and punished the syrian people while not helping to reform the government mogherini and top european diplomats should have gone and advised them on european concerns this would have been more effective syrians will not propose anything but they respond to ideas they just want to survive so offer things that can help them survive don t threaten them you cannot go to them with threats or sanctions syria needs help securing the country and its borders supporting security forces law enforcement the loss of human resources is a generational challenge there are lost skills the labor force has lost its ethics soldiers have emerged from 7 years of service with no skills the country s youth are gone there are social wounds that nobody is healing values have been destroyed syrians look up to the new class of warlords and war profiteers syrians are more corrupt than their own government now and now the west wants to continue torturing and tormenting this country just because the political elites won t change one interesting piece of good news that could be expanded upon is that something that resembles the afghan national solidarity program is now being experimented with in syria it is a community based bottom up approach led by the un the government has approved a pilot project so there is space for activity this is a formula that can make the west comfortable and prevent the collapse of country it s one of the few examples where the government has been earnest to do something positive the russians and international community should support it there will never be a political deal in syria but a nationwide community building program of national solidarity can work assad himself has just spoken about strengthening communities the role of municipalities in bringing local knowledge to help rebuild the country the focus should be on the tactical issues that can make the country slightly better the credibility of institutions is not high so these local solidarity programs can work as an alternative the syrian government is not progressive but they approved a project that allows communities to get together and open a bank account and they have public meetings to identify their priorities and work to improve their community with un oversight there are two pilots now in syria one of them in zabadani which was under siege and one in jaramana which had a population that tripled thanks to internally displaced people for a west which refuses to deal with assad but claims it wants to support syrians there is an opportunity to engage with the government to improve the lives of syrians at a local level public services are a key to reconciliation if they are improved the state is sending a message to the public that institutions are back it will be reform based on community outreach not the traditional baathist approach of telling people what they want but instead listening to communities telling the state what they want this will also help buy peace and stability by making the community busy with non political issues or at least issues that are not overtly and exclusively political municipalities are the neutral structure at a local level this is why the opposition s local councils were briefly successful we start by identifying the least politicized sectors and we initially avoid a dialogue about and reconciliation or the constitution or justice and we focus on just the basic services that communities need unlike iraq libya yemen afghanistan or somalia the structures and institutions were preserved they did not collapse but their area of operation contracted now that the state is returning how do we strengthen it to deliver better services and to rebrand the regime as the state syria still has a chance to recover and emerge from this war changes have taken place in syrian society on both sides of the divide that could be cultivated so that the bloodshed will not have been completely in vain just as environmental shocks punctuate the equilibrium of the world s ecosystem provoking evolutionary changes so too do wars and struggle on the government s side a generation of officers has become accustomed to negotiating and compromising with the other they are no longer provoked by differences of opinion a regime that struggled to talk to civilian opponents has for the last few years been regularly negotiating with insurgents it called terrorists striking deals with them calling them patriots and cooperating with them acknowledging their grassroots legitimacy and authority senior regime officials regularly explain that syria can never be ruled as it was before the social contract between the state and its population was broken in 2011 for the state to return to much of syria and be accepted it will have to rely on local leaders and a devolution of power to the local level meanwhile the media and social media in loyalist areas have become more diverse and tolerant of dissent as long as red lines are not crossed loyalists today often sound like the opposition of 2011 they believe they have struggled and sacrificed and they are entitled to make demands their loyalty cannot be questioned they have also grown disillusioned with a government that failed to deliver them out of this crisis thanks to its corruption and incompetence at the same time in opposition areas a core of leaders and activists have survived the war and emerged as competent managers relying on creativity and the freedom that results from anarchy they have made connections with international networks and have key skills to bring to the new syria that will emerge from the ashes and rubble if left alone by the international community these syrians will have an opportunity to find their own way out of the crisis and in so doing to create a new and independent model for recovery syrian businessmen outside want to reengage they care about syria s future but they want to hear from the government an acknowledgement that syria cannot be ruled the way it was before and that there is a serious desire for real reform our message to the government should be that together we can change syria s destiny through a partnership between the government and all the syrian stakeholders inside and outside as a recent world bank report found the breakdown of the systems that organize both the economy and society along with the trust that binds people together has had a greater economic impact than the destruction of physical infrastructure in a sense the government controls the useless syria the part without resources or at least the government only has the human resources we should work on reconnecting and reorganizing syria so that the area with the demand is connected to the area with the supply which is currently held by the syrian pkk the government s institutions lack the capacity to reconnect to these areas the government s institutions cannot even deliver efficient governance to the syria they control they certainly lack the ability to reach across the frontline and appeal to people who lived in insurgent controlled territories the insurgent held zones of the country will not accept the return of the regime overnight but they might accept an organic and gradual return of the state beginning with services provided by the red crescent bakeries water health education and an increased connection to government held areas through economic cooperation with the blessing of the prominent families and businessmen who are respected in opposition areas so bring together syria s sectoral based technocrats and begin with the least politicized sectors engaging the people who left the area in the reconstruction we need to bring people back home even if the government does not want them back and even if the neighboring host countries want them to stay to extort more money from the international community the biggest problem with the west s political approach is that it still says assad must go this can lead nowhere it is better to have a process based on the notion that the regime won then you have a process with which it in the interest of the regime to engage we are dealing with a system in syria that is not ideological it is pragmatic like the syrians who will attend our consultations we should rely on syrian pragmatism syria is going through a transition the state remains weak and not fully restored as gramsci said the crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear now is the time to shape the outcome with minimal cost the syrian state needs a partner on the opposition side we can create a new opposition a technocratic opposition the government can make a deal with this technocratic loyal opposition will be interested in reform not upheaval or collaboration with the enemies of syria this new opposition will be an alternative to what has come to be known as the opposition for the last six years the international backed people appointed by the so called friends of syria and these new opposition technocrats genuinely seeking a national solution and participation in the government can be governors ministers etc by showing damascus what this group has to offer we can transform how the regime views the opposition from a malignant tumor to a cure for syria s ailments we can offer the government an alternative to the foreign imposed opposition the soc snc hnc sig etc we can show the government that these syrians outside are technocrats looking for a national solution they want to participate in the economy and government they can become governors and ministers and bring with them much needed expertise experience and resources they can work on the social and development and administrative issues that must be addressed since 2013 in my meetings with senior officials in damascus they have clearly acknowledged that syria cannot be ruled the way it was before this is because an implicit social contract was broken before 2011 syrians obeyed the law and accepted the state and its system many cities did not have a security or military presence this is why much of syria fell to insurgents in 2011 and 2012 without any fighting and the government had to send forces from outside the area in a futile attempt to retake it the city of minbij is such an example it fell without a fight but this applies to much of syria it was enough for damascus to send a policeman to a remote area and he would be feared and obeyed but this belief in the state s authority was broken in 2011 now damascus would have to militarily occupy every town to control it and no state has this ability especially not the syrian one with its depleted security forces and the allies of the government the russians iranians iraqis or lebanese are not occupying forces they only help retake territory from insurgents before handing it over to government holding forces but the government lacks holding forces this is why since 2014 the government has been making offers to insurgents that they administer territory on behalf of the state in effect the opposition becoming the regime year after year the west rejected this instead of investing in this opportunity and strengthening it and turning it into a solution the government s vision was that locals can have the administration while damascus controls the resources whether borders power stations national highways oil or gas the government s lack of ideology or plan has confounded some but also allowed it to pragmatically adapt to these realities the official opposition and its backers refused some of these offers and were left with less than what they could have had or nothing in addition to its recognition that it must rely on locals to control or administer territory on its behalf the culture of the government has also evolved since 2014 it has become routine for commanders in the security forces to make deals and form partnerships with the enemy with men they used to call terrorists individual commanders would become invested in their partnership with former insurgents and find themselves defending their former enemies sympathizing with them explaining to colleagues what motivated their initial betrayal and praising them as patriots for returning as older more hawkish commanders retire or die this new generation has risen to dominance and for them it is normal to talk to the other to negotiate make deals form partnerships acknowledge that these men have local authority and legitimacy and lastly unlike any other civil war or conflict we have identified in syria it has become routine since 2014 to grant safe passage to surrounded and defeated insurgents and their families too often with their weapons through government territory to some other insurgent held territory from where they may fight the government again and in almost 4 years there have been no breeches of these agreements this pragmatism should come as no surprise to those who know the regime from the beginning of the uprising it sought to offer local concessions to appease communities and buy calm it also offered concessions regarding the constitution decentralization and other issues culminating in assad s 2013 promulgation of a vision based on a national dialogue conference constitutional reforms and elections critics might argue that this was just a way for the regime to survive with assad at its head and they are correct but this does not negate the fact that the government demonstrated pragmatism and a desire to compromise it just was not the total surrender or suicide sought by its enemies but now we are where we are and all sides have to pursue pragmatism if they want a better syria the war has only lasted six years and people have not severed all ties and they remember the syria they loved before 2011 we can help them formulate a new discourse get reacquainted with each other and each other s problems and work on projects that can bridge the divide such as joint economic or humanitarian projects across opposing lines we can work on transforming the war economy into a constructive economy if we reduce the existential threat to the state we open the space for the regime s stakeholders to make changes and expand their base so that they too emerge stronger how do we convince syrians inside and outside that there is a national project one that gives them enough security to invest in the refugee crisis will only be solved through confidence and guarantees the russians can help with this syrian institutions need to reform or else communal wounds on both sides will reopen as they did in september over the new school curriculum how do we convince decision makers in damascus that they need to change how do we convince them to work with civil society to reduce external influence if we want syrians who can rebuild the country and investors to feel secure how do we begin institutional reform how does assad achieve a new social contract the way his father did after the traumatic 1980s how does assad lead the transition towards stability and putting the country back together what can be done on judicial reform decentralization local governance social reconciliation land dispute resolution what are the models that we should be working on for a future syria that is better than pre war syria how do we get the productive syrians back to work how do we restore or build their trust in government institutions today syrian families dream of sending their sons abroad there is no syrian dream and no hope how do we change that what is local governance in syria and how do you reform it what are the historic grievances and how do we address the easiest ones how do we ease military service requirements so young men will not flee the country but will stay and work how should the government reward its loyal base to prevent criminality and anger being channeled into negative activities how should historic centers of cities like homs be rebuilt so that communities regain their identity and are inspired what are the strategic sectors the government should support to restore syrian growth how do you get syrians to rebuild syria how do we make reconstruction a process to bring syrians together what are the new administrative models needed in syria how do you make syrian institutions more accessible how do you prepare syrian institutions for reconstruction how do you improve their capacity to absorb international aid how do you give municipalities more oversight over services these are the questions we should be taking to assad the europeans and russians should be engaging with him directly on these issues the government is going to want its modern syrians to come back so it will have to engage in a compact with them official or unofficial they will need clarity what is the space in the economy allocated for the government s allies russia iran china etc what is the space allocated for the oligarchs and war profiteers who arose in the crisis and what is the space allocated for traditional businessmen most of the business community did not embrace the uprising but withdrew and waited out the storm they were pragmatic and cynical they do not care about who is the president they just expect him and the security forces to provide a stable environment for them their families and their businesses the businessmen who moved to lebanon or elsewhere do not need to return but they want to because they are emotionally committed to syria and they want their children to live in syria the international businesses who want to return cannot do so via the so called shabiha or the oligarchs affiliated with the regime they need to do so via the legitimate businessmen they dealt with before the war this may seem like it s about business but in fact this approach is very political we want the people who had factories farms services and companies inside syria to come back as i have argued before regarding local ceasefires there are no macro solutions for syria only small ones and if individual solutions fail it will not lead to a cascading effect the economy like stability will improve through the consolidation of small successes but the micro solutions we pursue should have a big impact we should propose things that can be implemented the fastest and have the fastest impact syria is in a transition period now its final shape still not clear or determined this is the time to try and shape the new syria born out of the war our message to the syrian government should be together we can change the destiny of syria through a partnership between the government and stakeholders like businessmen and technocrats from outside and inside people who cannot be attacked because they were not openly regime or openly opposition we have to talk about the future of syria economically socially etc and discuss implicitly political issues like reconstruction social issues education rehabilitating the syria people constitutional reform decentralization and improving laws so their can be growth the end result will be a syrian government that relaxes its control over administrative issues and retains control over sovereign issues growth is hope the syrian conflict will be over when we restore economic growth take east aleppo its residents are the losers of the war their homes destroyed their families displaced inside or outside syria but they were the engine of aleppo s thriving pre war economy they were its laborers there has to be a housing program that formalizes informal housing so that they can reclaim their homes they then have to be helped to rebuild their own homes the government should not view areas like this as the social base of the insurgency the way it did during the war but the engine of recovery if they do not return then aleppo will never recover and their return will have secondary and tertiary effects they will attract products from the surrounding agricultural areas whether food or the raw materials for workshops and factories cotton olive oil etc and if the residents of these surrounding agricultural areas are unable to find a market for their labor they will remain poor and insecure an unemployed labor force not attracted to work in the city angry at the city easily recruited for trouble making rebuilding east aleppo old homs etc brings back sunni money this is the working class and they move money through their traditional systems outside the control of governments this money can be moved to support an insurgency as it was or to support reconstruction and a renaissance and their areas were the focus of international attention romanticized by the backers of the revolution so it will receive positive political support the government will be able to raise resources and demonstrate that it has a reconciliation agenda by supporting growth in sunni hubs that were iconic centers of the revolution these areas can mobilize a lot of money from expats in the gulf large scale infrastructure projects will go to iran russia china but it s syrians from the gulf who will rebuild all the small things we can create a new model for the post war recovery of a shattered country thanks to russia and iran and even the syrian government itself syria avoided the worst possible outcome a collapse of the state or an isis takeover but we are left with the second worst outcome a securitized system winning the war militarily but offering no reform agenda syria has a major displacement problem to solve it you need housing but housing needs the legal capacity to solve disputes and a land management capacity it needs statecraft builders engineers and a middle class those do not exist in syria anymore these issues would not be solved even with reconstruction money and these issues certainly will not be solved with more sanctions syria needs hope today the greater damascus region the capital metropole area is being planned each line drawn by a junior architect in damascus is trampling over thousands of properties livelihoods lives and memories those are un sanctionable offenses that no one can see but they are happening and they are shaping syria s future for generations it s not syria after the conflict that will be born it s a post syria that is being pulled apart options and entry points are very limited and the context is so policed and traumatized that no space is left for good intentions it is difficult to appeal to the best intentions of government officials when they feel so victorious or when they are afraid of being called unpatriotic or when they feel under siege the worst mistakes that the syrian government will make are still ahead of it at least for the syrian people attempting to plan reconstruction without even the inclusion of even a minimal local voice will only create huge grievances that will grow bigger by the day even if the displaced never returned to reclaim their rights even if the enemy is walled or kept outside syria this injustice will still haunt syria s future along with the unknown fate of tens of thousands of missing detainees their families desperate to know if they are dead or alive instability is only one generation away and next time might involve other segments of the population someone needs to say to the government of assad that damascus will be built by its own people not by the emirates syria also needs its defeated people to participate not only the loyalist base the government needs to reach out or else it will be strangled by the hands of its own supporters what is left of the syrian pie is not enough to feed its base of supporters within the syrian government there are many level minded people that recognize the issues they face they also know what s wrong with syria and that its fabric is torn those individuals are also in very authoritative places of power but they are not empowered to push back against the regime s worst security impulses reformers fear being stabbed in the back and everyone wants to prove he is a patriot in the great partition the making of india and pakistan british historian yasmin khan asserted that the partition of india which killed over one million and displaced many millions stands testament to the follies of empire which ruptures community evolution distorts historical trajectories and forces violent state formation from societies that would otherwise have taken different and unknowable paths the same lessons can be learned from the past and iraq and libya today from the clumsy international intervention in syria and tomorrow from the war in iran or whatever country is next those who supported intervention should ask themselves if they wittingly or unwittingly made things worse those who call for justice and accountability in syria should begin with the policies of their own governments lastly sanctions could be seen as an opportunity to increase independence from a western system that holds you hostage to cooperate more with your neighbors integrate economically and even politically with your neighbors like iraq and jordan even turkey the future is in greater middle eastern unity not divisions

quarter 2017 a 4 decrease natural gas production decreased 18 while oil and condensate and ngl production increased 10 and 4 respectively fourth quarter 2018 equivalent production was negatively impacted by decreased oil production in the williston basin decreased gas production due to lack of new activity in the haynesville cotton valley and the uinta basin divestiture in september 2018 which contributed 3 9 bcf in the fourth quarter 2017 operating expenses during the fourth quarter 2018 lease operating expense loe was 59 5 million or 5 11 per boe a decrease of 25 compared with the fourth quarter 2017 the decrease in total loe was primarily due to reduced workovers in the williston basin and haynesville cotton valley and the uinta basin divestiture partially offset by increased power and fuel labor maintenance and repair expenses on our permian basin properties during the fourth quarter 2018 adjusted transportation and processing t p costs a non gaap measure were 38 5 million or 3 31 per boe a decrease of 10 compared with the fourth quarter 2017 primarily due to the uinta basin divestiture combined with a decrease in haynesville cotton valley from lower gas production these decreases were partially offset by increases in the permian basin due to higher gas recovery during the fourth quarter 2018 general and administrative expense g a was 57 5 million or 4 95 per boe an increase of 27 compared with the fourth quarter 2017 the increase in total g a expense in the fourth quarter 2018 was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with the implementation of our 2018 strategic initiatives the increase was partially offset by a decrease in share based compensation and in the mark to market value of the deferred compensation wrap plan and a decrease in outside services during the fourth quarter 2018 production and property taxes were 26 9 million or 2 31 per boe a decrease of 5 compared with the fourth quarter 2017 the decrease in production and property taxes was primarily due to decreased revenues in the williston and uinta basins and production tax exemptions in haynesville cotton valley partially offset by increased revenues in the permian basin capital investment total capital investment was 205 7 million on an accrual basis for the fourth quarter 2018 compared with 1 056 3 million for the fourth quarter 2017 total capital investment for the year ended december 31 2018 on an accrual basis was 1 242 2 million down 792 8 million compared with the year ended december 31 2017 due to the acquisition of oil and

fourth quarter 2018 compared with 372 2 million for the fourth quarter 2017 of which 170 7 million related to the drilling completion and equipping of wells and 16 8 million was related to infrastructure investment the decrease in capital expenditures was primarily related to decreased drilling and completion activity in the permian basin and limited activity in the williston basin and haynesville cotton valley in the fourth quarter 2018 capital investment excluding property acquisitions was 1 176 6 million on an accrual basis for the year ended december 31 2018 compared with 1 219 8 million for the year ended december 31 2017 of which 1 089 3 million related to the drilling completion and equipping of wells and 83 0 million was related to infrastructure investment the decrease in capital expenditures was primarily related to decreased drilling and completion activity in the williston basin and reduced well refracturing activity in the haynesville cotton valley partially offset by increased drilling and completion activity in the permian basin during the year ended december 31 2018 qep acquired various oil and gas properties which primarily included proved and

5 william phillips please do your thing the matter of sluggish wage growth within developed economies is one of the great modern subjects of debate in economics the famous phillips curve which suggests inflation should rise as unemployment falls has proven a less than reliable model to understand and predict labour wage and inflation dynamics in the past decade an alternative but well known explanation for what is keeping wage and price growth subdued is this the globalising of markets has attracted an influx of cheap labour creating an over supply in the global economy capital in a search to maximize profit has been directed when possible to places where labour is abundant and cheapest when cheap labour can t be utilized mostly due to business models that depend on local or more sophisticated labour automation takes place in order to sustain profitability instead 6 unemployment data on tap today the arrangement leads to a set of circumstances whereby although nominally full employment is achieved labour is underutilized wages don t grow consequently dragging on other areas such as consumption investment and savings there is still hope from policy boffins that the described phenomenon will prove transient and that the outlook for wage growth and all the areas it impacts will progressively improve of course it won t be remedied today but employment numbers released this morning will contribute to the evolving narrative the australian economy is expected to have added 15k jobs last month enough to keep the unemployment rate to around 5 per cent with traders pricing that the next move from the rba will be a cut a pull back in the aud or further falls in acg bond yields may be what to watch for today 7 if fomc is dovish then markets can stay bullish as far as the australian dollar goes it ll be more determined by us dollar activity and speculation regarding the us china trade war beyond all else in the short term case in point the aud has pulled back slightly this morning after the us dollar rallied following the release of january s fomc meeting minutes as far as the minutes go they have been well received in markets so far in essence nothing too surprising has been communicated by the fed in their minutes they confirm ultimately the cautiously optimistic but explicitly dovish stance the central bank adopted at the january meeting though the seemingly inexorably downgrades to forward earnings will inhibit sentiment on wall street for now an accommodative fed is giving traders the permission to take risk and search for yield 8 market watch market highlights spi futures up 4 points at about 6 30am aedt aud flat at 71 63 us cents on wall st at 2 36pm dow 0 2 s p 500 0 2 nasdaq flat in europe stoxx 50 0 6 ftse 0 7 cac 0 7 dax 08 spot gold 0 2 to us1343 83 an ounce at 1 47pm new york time brent crude 1 to us67 13 a barrel us oil 1 8 to us57 10 a barrel iron ore 1 4 to us88 00 a tonne dalian iron ore 0 4 to 624 yuan lme aluminium 0 7 to us1868 a tonne lme copper 1 4 to us6405 a tonne 2 year yield us 2 50 australia 1 70 5 year yield us 2 47 australia 1 72 10 year yield us 2 65 australia 2 10 germany 0 10 us australia 10 year yield gap at 6 38am aedt 55 basis points this column was produced in commercial partnership between the sydney morning herald the age and ig
johannesburg the rand yesterday weakened further as investors stood on the sidelines and shifted their focus on today s budget and how the government will assist ailing state owned entities soes without compromising the fiscal consolidation path the local unit depreciated to an intra day low of r14 21 against the dollar as finance minister tito mboweni prepared to present his first budget speech in the midst of a deteriorating fiscal outlook andré botha a senior dealer at treasuryone said markets are waiting in anticipation of the budget speech in order to ascertain how mboweni will balance the books and how he will handle eskom and the other soes ratings agency moody s which is the last of the three big ratings agencies to leave south africa s credit rating at investment grade level is expected to provide its rating review on the country next month after it had digested the contents of the budget steven nathan the chief executive of 10x investments said mboweni would have to walk a tightrope between being right and being popular it appears moody s is reluctant to drop the sword on our investment grade rating because condemning our local government debt to junk status could flatten the rand ignite inflation and strangle our economy but at some point it may have no other choice lukman otunuga a research analyst at fxtm said markets would be watching to see whether the budget statement expressed concern over the global economic environment and impacts it could have on the south african economy he said the local currency was also hamstrung by the latest round of trade talks between the us and china set to resume in washington tomorrow appetite towards the local currency and other emerging market currencies was impacted by caution ahead of the us china trade talks in washington this week officials from washington and beijing met last week in the chinese capital for trade negotiations mboweni s frank maiden medium term budget policy statement in october showed an economy at the crossroads and facing a debt trap estimates from the national treasury at the time showed that the cost of financing the government s debt would now exceed the budget by r7 9 billion in the 2020 21 financial year mboweni further warned that gross debt would only stabilise to 59 6 percent of the growth domestic product in 2024 25 against the previously projected 56 2 percent in february 2018 analysts expect that revenue shortfall could amount to about r5bn to r10bn in the current fiscal year president cyril ramaphosa in his state of the nation address earlier this month said eskom would receive further financial support from the central government allan gray portfolio manager sandy mcgregor said that faced with sky high debt a stagnant economy and disappointing tax collections south africa was on an unsustainable fiscal path one of the great disappointments of 2017 and 2018 has been the economy s failure to escape from its current stagnation despite strong synchronised global growth he said
good news at the start of 2019 is that the risk of an outright global recession is low the bad news is that growth will fall new york after the synchronized global economic expansion of 2017 came the asynchronous growth of 2018 when most countries other than the united states started to experience slowdowns worries about us inflation the us federal reserve s policy trajectory ongoing trade wars italian budget and debt woes china s slowdown and emerging market fragilities led to a sharp fall in global equity markets toward the end of the year the good news at the start of 2019 is that the risk of an outright global recession is low the bad news is that we are heading into a year of synchronized global deceleration growth will fall toward and in some cases below potential in most regions to be sure the year started with a rally in risky assets us and global equities after the bloodbath of the last quarter of 2018 when worries about fed interest rate hikes and about chinese and us growth tanked many markets since then the fed has pivoted toward renewed dovishness the us has maintained solid growth and china s macroeconomic easing has shown some promise of containing the slowdown there whether these relatively positive conditions last will depend on many factors the first thing to consider is the fed markets are now pricing in the fed s monetary policy pause for the entire year but the us labor market remains robust were wages to accelerate and produce even moderate inflation above two percent fears of at least two more rate hikes this year would return possibly shocking markets and leading to a tightening of financial conditions that in turn will revive concerns about us growth second as the slowdown in china continues the government s current mix of modest monetary credit and fiscal stimulus could prove inadequate given the lack of private sector confidence and high levels of overcapacity and leverage if worries about a chinese slowdown resurface markets could be severely affected on the other hand a stabilization of growth would duly renew market confidence a related factor is trade while an escalation of the sino american conflict would hamper global growth a continuation of the current truce via a deal on trade would reassure markets even as the two countries geopolitical and technology rivalry continues to build over time fourth the eurozone is slowing down and it remains to be seen whether it is heading toward lower potential growth or something worse the outcome will be determined both by national level variables such as political developments in france italy and germany and broader regional and global factors obviously a hard brexit would negatively affect business and investor confidence in the united kingdom and the european union alike us president donald trump extending his trade war to the european automotive sector would severely undercut growth across the eu not just in germany finally much will depend on how euroskeptic parties fare in the european parliament elections this may and that in turn will add to the uncertainties surrounding european central bank president mario draghi s successor and the future of eurozone monetary policy fifth america s dysfunctional domestic politics could add to uncertainties globally the recent government shutdown suggests that every upcoming negotiation over the budget and the debt ceiling will turn into a partisan war of attrition an expected report from the special counsel robert mueller may or may not lead to impeachment proceedings against trump and by the end of the year the fiscal stimulus from the republican tax cuts will become a fiscal drag possibly weakening growth sixth equity markets in the us and elsewhere are still overvalued even after the recent correction as wage costs rise weaker us earnings and profit margins in the coming months could be an unwelcome surprise with highly indebted firms facing the possibility of rising short and long term borrowing costs and with many tech stocks in need of further corrections the danger of another risk off episode and market correction can t be ruled out seventh oil prices may be driven down by a coming supply glut owing to shale production in the us a potential regime change in venezuela leading to expectations of greater production over time and failures by opec countries to cooperate with one another to constrain output while low oil prices are good for consumers they tend to weaken us stocks and markets in oil exporting economies raising concerns about corporate defaults in the energy and related sectors as happened in early 2016 finally the outlook for many emerging market economies will depend on the aforementioned global uncertainties the chief risks include slowdowns in the us or china higher us inflation and a subsequent tightening by the fed trade wars a stronger dollar and falling oil and commodity prices though there is a cloud over the global economy the silver lining is that it has made the major central banks more dovish starting with the fed and the people s bank of china and quickly followed by the european central bank the bank of england the bank of japan and others still the fact that most central banks are in a highly accommodative position means that there is little room for additional monetary easing and even if fiscal policy wasn t constrained in most regions of the world stimulus tends to come only after a growth stall is already underway and usually with a significant lag there may be enough positive factors to make this a relatively decent if mediocre year for the global economy but if some of the negative scenarios outlined above materialize the synchronized slowdown of 2019 could lead to a global growth stall and

the united states manufacturing industry once the central pillar of the american economy and a robust ladder to middle class employment today exhibits significant structural weaknesses that have metastasized over the past several decades since the early 1980s the combined effects of automation and especially trade liberalization resulted in a dramatic decline in manufacturing employment as well as in the sector s value added or the industry s contribution to u s gross domestic product see figure 1 figure 1 yet the united states robust but neglected research and development infrastructure and skilled workforce can open up opportunities for re energizing u s manufacturing and creating high tech job opportunities that pay well produce globally competitive products and create new strongholds of manufacturing innovation in regions across the country policymakers can and must offer support on multiple levels to guide this transition to understand the necessary steps to be taken however it is first important to analyze why and how u s manufacturing has weakened massachusetts institute of technology economist and equitable growth research advisory board member david autor and other scholars identify the removal of trade barriers with china as a result of its admission to the world trade organization in 2001 as a particularly important cause of u s manufacturing s recent decline in employment autor and his co authors also find that these trade shocks produced a similar drop in manufacturing wages with low wage workers experiencing the largest losses on the other hand uc berkeley economist and equitable growth columnist brad delong downplays the importance of trade deals and instead identifies our failure to invest in our middle class human capital base and engineering infrastructure as important culprits of manufacturing s relative downturn in the united states indeed in addition to the decline in the quantity of manufacturing jobs there has also been a pronounced drop in the quality of jobs for many manufacturing workers in the united states while many of these workers were displaced into low wage jobs in the service sector those who remained in manufacturing are now paid lower wages and have fewer benefits researchers at the national employment law project find that for the first time in decades manufacturing workers now fall in the bottom half of the wage distribution making 7 7 percent less than the median worker in 2013 one of the reasons for this decline are anti union policy changes at the state level and the shift of manufacturing employment to right to work states in the south these developments hollowed out unionization in manufacturing industries from 1 in 3 workers 30 years ago to 1 in 10 today in addition sociologist annette bernhardt and other researchers at the university of california berkeley document a simultaneous explosion in contingent temporary work within the manufacturing industry both of these trends led to reduced wages in this sector with nonunionized and temporary workers making about 1 40 and 4 less per hour respectively than unionized and permanent employees in the industry despite continuing challenges for manufacturing workers the industry has partially recovered from the great recession a decade ago after a sharp decline in employment and output between 2007 and 2010 the sector bounced back and experienced particularly strong growth beginning in mid 2016 with the rebound in national and global demand although many of the jobs that have since been created pay lower wages and are less likely to be unionized there are some indices that point toward emerging headwinds for the industry in the form of tariffs higher prices the fading impact of the 2017 tax cuts for corporations and slowing global growth yet aggregate u s factory production rose in december 2018 by 1 1 percent its largest growth rate in 10 months nevertheless manufacturing remains vulnerable to demand shocks and suffers from low aggregate levels of innovation economists kevin kliesen and john tatom of the federal reserve argue that the u s manufacturing sector remains strong compared to its competitors in other developed countries importantly however kliesen and tatom point out that manufacturing s health today remains largely contingent on the business cycle and that a dearth of innovation has depressed its output potential despite highly innovative pockets in certain regions and subsectors of the industry to enhance the long term health and resilience of the u s manufacturing sector growing evidence indicates that policymakers and other stakeholders should encourage a shift to advanced manufacturing or the deployment of innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence in manufacturing production traditional mass manufacturing of basic consumer goods increasingly relies on lowering labor costs which are much higher in the united states than in many emerging economies and cheaply maintaining bulky capital infrastructure much of which has likewise deteriorated in recent decades in the united states alternatively advanced manufacturing relies on resources where the united states can or at least should have a competitive advantage because of a skilled workforce and a highly developed research and development infrastructure indeed a mckinsey analysis finds that the u s could boost manufacturing gdp by up to 530 billion and employment by 2 4 million jobs over current trends with the largest upside potential concentrated in advanced manufacturing industries such as aerospace computers renewable energy and electronics from the perspective of labor advanced manufacturing creates opportunities for high skill middle class employment for millions of workers as mit s autor has studied automation technologies can be a substitute for workers thus explaining much of the employment decline in traditional manufacturing but he also points out that automation technologies can be complementary to labor creating demand for workers in roles in technology intensive sectors where human supervision creativity and critical thinking are indispensable as a result workers interested in entering advanced manufacturing in the coming decades will enjoy a tighter labor market in which there is much greater demand for skilled workers than there is supply compared to traditional manufacturing and service jobs in other sectors specifically a deloitte analysis finds that without further investments in upskilling there will be 2 4 million unfilled job openings in manufacturing by 2028 there is some evidence that this labor shortage might create incentives for employers in advanced manufacturing to offer good wages benefits and training opportunities such as apprenticeships to attract the talent they need to succeed according to researchers at the brookings institution the average wage in advanced industries is 90 000 almost twice the u s mean furthermore a report by the nonprofit research organization jobs for the future finds that career prospects of workers in advanced manufacturing are dramatically better than those in traditional manufacturing the reason jobs in production of basic consumer goods are often static while advanced manufacturing jobs especially those that convey both technical and management skills can serve as lifetime jobs or careers as well as springboard jobs to other industries where workers can make use of the technical and management skills acquired in advanced manufacturing despite these promising structural features legal scholar brishen rogers at temple university says more needs to be done to enhance u s employment laws he argues that updating and expanding employment law will be necessary to ensure that middle class wages enhanced working conditions and ample opportunities for employment are available in the high tech workplaces of the future by building off u s strengths in human capital and r d to enhance the production process expanding advanced manufacturing would also be beneficial to u s firms because it would increase their competitiveness vis à vis manufacturers in other countries a growing body of economic evidence demonstrates that advanced manufacturing technologies such as additive manufacturing also known as 3d printing can help u s firms transition to production of more innovative customized products with greater added value similarly so called cloud manufacturing or coordinating and upgrading manufacturing processes via networks online can help reduce costs for firms by sharing expensive resources in these interconnected digital networks beyond bringing down firms costs this more nimble and innovative production model allows u s firms to more easily respond to demand shocks and customize products to meet consumer trends as a result hec paris economist john hombert and princeton university economist adrien matray find that manufacturing firms that invest in r d and thereby increase product differentiation are about twice as resilient to trade shocks a shift to advanced manufacturing would also increase competition within the u s manufacturing sector by reducing inequalities between firms of different sizes and in different regions the innovations in production processes mentioned above stand to lower barriers to entry for new production creating opportunities for small and medium sized enterprises across regions regardless of pre existing manufacturing infrastructure substantiating this effect much of the post great recession manufacturing growth has been concentrated not only in large high tech hubs such as the san francisco bay area but also in smaller cities characterized by highly skilled workforces among them orlando florida salt lake city utah and raleigh north carolina in fact many cities in the traditionally industrial rust belt including the michigan cities of grand rapids and troy have bounced back by creating an attractive regional ecosystem for manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals electric and automated cars renewable energy and other innovative sectors notably much of this production is small in scale in grand rapids for example 80 percent of its 2 500 manufacturing firms have fewer than 250 employees to further manufacturing growth along these lines policymakers need to encourage less outsourcing of u s supply chains so that process innovation in manufacturing occurs in these and other manufacturing regions of the nation as highlighted by case western university economist susan helper and her co author at case western timothy krueger in a 2016 paper supply chains and equitable growth increasing competition within the manufacturing sector would also reverse the current trend toward monopsony in the labor market and thereby improve manufacturing workers bargaining position for better wages benefits and working conditions equitable growth economist kate bahn points to the increasingly negative ramifications of monopsony power the disproportionate power of employers to set wages and other work conditions in the contemporary labor market in some ways though the u s manufacturing sector is an outlier in this regard temple university economist doug webber points out that relatively high levels of unionization in the sector may have held back the growth of monopsony in manufacturing compared to many service sectors such as health care and administrative support still manufacturing hasn t been spared from the economywide trend toward monopsony indeed economists efraim benmelech at the kellogg school of management nittai bergman at tel aviv university and hyunseob kim at cornell university find that labor market concentration in u s manufacturing experienced relatively small but notable growth from 1977 to 2009 turning to the effects of this change on workers earnings mit s autor harvard university economist and equitable growth research advisory board member lawrence katz and mit doctoral candidate and equitable growth research scholar christina patterson estimate along with their co authors that this increase explains one third of the decline in the labor share of income in u s manufacturing between 1997 and 2012 additionally benmelech and his co authors find that the negative effects of labor market concentration on wages in manufacturing are largest when unionization rates are low working with labor community educational and environmental stakeholders policymakers can play an active role to make sure the necessary physical social and legal infrastructures exist to ensure the success of advanced manufacturing for both workers and firms to start policymakers must support the deployment of innovation in the process of production which is at the core of advanced manufacturing this is why federal state and local governments should invest heavily in public universities and other research institutions and increase these institutions connections with the private sector additionally policymakers should encourage and facilitate the adoption of new efficiency enhancing technologies in the production process especially for small businesses and pursue robust antitrust enforcement to ensure competition in manufacturing industries case western s helper for example argues for policymakers to encourage more collaborative supply chain practices where innovation is shared among firms in addition to promoting high road advanced manufacturing jobs through a variety of policy levels finally policymakers must keep middle class opportunities for workers at the center of manufacturing s future by developing lifelong training programs and apprenticeships that upskill workers and match them to jobs in the field enforcing rigorous standards for wages salaries and employment conditions and strengthening unions and other forms of collective action as manufacturing advances and increases in productivity policies and institutions need to be in place so that workers are able to share in the gains from this growth that their labor makes possible many obituaries have been written for the u s manufacturing sector but this habit of declaring manufacturing a thing of the past is undoubtedly premature a nascent body of work indicates that a talent and tech driven manufacturing renaissance could well be on the horizon in the united states but it is up to our policymakers to help lead the way to this innovative future
overview the us dollar is narrowly mixed against the major currencies but the strongest currency today is the chinese yuan following reports that us wants china to keep the yuan stable and not offset us tariffs with currency depreciation the second monthly decline in japanese exports weighted on the yen in the uk another labour mp left while there is speculation that a few conservatives may defect today the focus in the us turns to the fomc minutes from last month s meeting that saw a meaningful change in the central bank s rhetoric the steep losses in the stock market and elevated volatility that spooked officials have been retraced by about 75 and the vix is at four month lows the msci asia pacific index has advanced for the third session and is at its highest level since october still more than 1 below its 200 day moving average the dow jones stoxx 600 firm enough to reach a new high for the year and fractionally below its 200 day moving average benchmark bond yields are little changed gold is at new 10 month highs and oil is trading slightly lower asia pacific the chinese yuan has risen by about 0 6 today which makes it the strongest currency today it is the third day of gains we had previously understood chinese officials to indicate they did not want the dollar to trade below cny6 70 however this area may now be challenged the ostensible trigger comes from reports that the us seeks a commitment by china to maintain a stable currency in the reports the meaning of stability real nominal basket bilateral is not clear but the idea is that the us is trying prevent china from offsetting tariffs with a weaker currency or seeking trade advantage from the exchange rate chinese officials have long said they desire a stable yuan and have pledged not to use the exchange rate as a trade weapon both sides are conflicted the us has encouraged china to allow markets to determine exchange rates if the market determined the yuan s value it would be more volatility and likely weaker chinese officials are engaged in various efforts to support the economy a yuan that does not adjust creates other distortions with the march 1 trade deadline approaching and both sides seemingly still far apart we are on the lookout for some sign of a delay the clearest indication of this came from president trump yesterday indicating that march 1 is not a magical date however us negotiators were using the deadline to help maintain pressure on china when playing the bad cop during natfa talks and early talks with china trump may have helped his negotiators but now playing nicer may weaken his negotiators from another angle trade representative lighthizer is a true believer but the president is more opportunistic japanese exports tumbled 8 4 in january the largest year over year decline in two years in december they were off 3 9 year over year exports to china were off 17 4 while chinese demand has weakened this may have been exaggerated by the distortions around

more interested in preserving competition within europe while the national leaders are interested in creating european champions that can compete with us japan and chinese combines former uk prime

toronto feb 19 2019 globe newswire hudbay minerals inc hudbay or the company tsx nyse hbm is pleased to announce increased mineral reserves and resources for its lalor mine and nearby satellite deposits and a new mine plan that includes the processing of gold and copper gold ore at the company s new britannia mill an updated national instrument ni 43 101 technical report for lalor will be filed on sedar by the end of the first quarter of 2019 all amounts are in u s dollars unless otherwise noted summary lalor annual gold production set to more than double from current levels once the new britannia mill is refurbished with average annual production of approximately 140 000 ounces during the first five years at a sustaining cash cost net of by product credits of 450 per ounce 1 positioning lalor as one of the lowest cost gold mines in canada positioning lalor as one of the lowest cost gold mines in canada gold recoveries are estimated to increase to 93 at the new britannia mill compared to 53 at the stall mill lalor s reserve update increased in situ contained gold by 65 copper by 23 zinc by 11 and silver by 15 2 drilling defined higher quality gold zone reserve estimates with increased gold grades the capital cost required to refurbish the new britannia mill is estimated at 95 million a low capital intensity low risk brownfield expansion lalor s life of mine production increased gold by 91 copper by 16 zinc by 13 and silver by 21 3 current reserve life of 10 years could be extended with successful conversion of additional mineral resources at lalor and additional resources at hudbay s satellite deposits in the snow lake region within trucking distance of stall and new britannia hudbay s extensive land package in the chisel basin and around snow lake provides significant additional upside for further gold and base metals exploration we are pleased to demonstrate the significant value we have unlocked so far by leveraging our exploration expertise our existing processing infrastructure and several inexpensive acquisitions to develop a compelling strategy to maximize the value of our gold mineralization at lalor and nearby deposits said alan hair hudbay s president and chief executive officer with our extensive experience operating responsibly in manitoba we look forward to delivering on this strategy over the next several years by refurbishing the new britannia mill substantially increasing our gold production at low cash costs and realizing additional value through continued exploration success overview lalor was discovered in 2007 on 100 owned land using hudbay s innovative exploration techniques and it is the largest vms deposit found in the snow lake region to date in 2009 the company commenced construction of lalor with initial ramp access from the chisel north mine construction of the main production shaft was approved in 2010 and was completed on time and on budget achieving commercial production in 2014 a mere seven years from initial discovery hudbay acquired the new britannia gold mill in 2015 for approximately 10 million as a potential long term processing option for the lalor gold and copper gold zones since acquiring new britannia hudbay has conducted significant technical work to assess the grade tonnage mineability and metallurgy of the gold and copper gold zones at lalor to support and de risk the investment required to refurbish new britannia and maximize the net present value of lalor most recently hudbay has focused on drilling and test mining in the gold rich lens 25 and has confirmed the existence of a continuous high grade core of mineralization within the wider lower grade mineral resource estimates reported in the ni 43 101 technical report for lalor dated march 31 2017 the 2017 technical report and most recently updated in hudbay s annual information form dated march 29 2018 the 2018 aif in parallel hudbay has revised its geological model of the copper gold rich lens 27 which better reflects the steeper orientation of the mineralization observed during core logging this re interpretation indicates there is a simpler and more consistent mineralized envelope and together with additional drilling conducted in 2018 has resulted in an increase in tonnage of this high grade mineralization refurbishing new britannia is expected to significantly increase gold production from lalor and enable new gold and copper gold exploration opportunities in the snow lake region by having an operating processing facility with substantially higher gold and copper recoveries new britannia was placed on care and maintenance in 2005 by its previous owner after producing 1 6 million ounces of gold and it demonstrates the opportunity to create additional value through owning multiple processing facilities in the flin flon and snow lake regions as hudbay pursues low risk brownfield development opportunities based on the detailed work completed in the last 12 months hudbay believes that the refurbishment of the new britannia mill including the addition of a copper flotation circuit is the optimal processing solution for lalor as it capitalizes on existing infrastructure significantly grows gold production from a deposit that is unencumbered by any royalties or streams and offers further upside potential from nearby satellite deposits the new britannia development plan contemplates completion of detailed engineering by february 2020 environmental permitting completion in april 2020 and construction activities occurring between june 2020 and august 2021 with plant commissioning and ramp up occurring during the fourth quarter of 2021 the estimated capital expenditures and the schedules for completion and plant ramp up are deemed to be low risk since this project involves industry standard equipment and proven processing technology in a brownfield environment permitting activities started in 2018 and are proceeding in line with the development plan the revised mine plan for lalor supports a 10 year mine life based solely on proven and probable reserves and utilizes the existing mining capacity of 4 500 tonnes per day at lalor for the first six years of the mine plan the technical work completed supports 4 500 tonnes per day as the optimal mining rate to maximize net present value although the lalor production shaft has the potential to hoist at higher throughput rates the production plan has the copper gold rich ore feeding a refurbished new britannia mill starting in 2022 at an average feed rate of 1 100 tonnes per day at 6 7 g t gold and 1 2 copper for seven years based on the current reserve estimate the new britannia mill is expected to achieve gold recoveries of approximately 93 compared to current gold recoveries of approximately 53 at the stall mill an estimated investment of 95 million c 124 million will be required between 2019 and 2021 for the refurbishment of the new britannia mill including the addition of a copper flotation and dewatering circuit and a pipeline to direct the tailings to the existing anderson facility of this approximately 10 million is expected to be incurred in 2019 as part of hudbay s growth capital expenditure plans between 2019 and 2021 the stall mill is expected to process approximately 3 500 tonnes per day and approximately 1 000 tonnes per day of lalor base metal ore is expected to be transported to the flin flon mill for processing based on the current reserves starting in 2022 stall mill throughput will gradually decrease from approximately 3 200 tonnes per day to approximately 1 800 tonnes per day the updated resource model at lalor includes 5 9 million tonnes of inferred mineral resources which has the potential to extend the mine life beyond 10 years while feeding both the stall and new britannia mills see lalor mineral resource estimates table below in addition the mineral resources at hudbay s satellite deposits in the snow lake region including the copper gold wim deposit acquired last year for c 0 5 million from alexandria minerals corporation the former gold producing new britannia mine and the zinc rich pen ii deposit could provide feed for the stall and new britannia processing facilities and further extend the mine life see regional exploration potential section below lalor mineral reserve and resource estimate

economic viability of the mineral resource estimates next steps in 2018 hudbay spent c 14 million on major airborne and ground geophysical surveys as well as on surface exploration drilling in the flin flon and snow lake areas this work was instrumental in identifying several base metal and gold targets that are to be tested in 2019 with a comparable exploration budget in parallel the company plans to spend approximately c 4 million on in mine exploration at lalor with the intent to convert inferred resources to indicated mineral resources and add additional inferred mineral resources in

zimbabwe s troubled quasi currency bond note which according to the government was trading at the same rate as the united states dollar had its peg dumped wednesday as the country starts establising an inter bank foreign exchange market in an attempt to control galloping inflation rising prices of basic commodities and the illegal money market in his monetary policy statement delivered wednesday central bank governor john mangudya said the reserve bank of zimbabwe took note of the excellent contributions from the business community bankers the academia the media and members of the public on the need to establish an inter bank foreign exchange market to formalise the selling and buying of us s through banks and bureaux de change mangudya said this is designed to bring sanity in the foreign currency market while at the same time promoting exports diaspora remittances and investments for the good of the zimbabwe economy he said the bank considered the implications accounting financial economic legal and social that are embedded in the establishment of an inter bank forex market within the context of the current national payment systems made up of real time gross settlement rtgs mobile payment platforms point of sale pos bond notes and coins after taking account of the implications and putting in place safeguards to maintain stability in the forex market the bank is with immediate effect establishing an inter bank foreign exchange market in zimbabwe to formalise the trading of rtgs balances and bond notes with us s and other currencies on a willing buyer willing seller basis through banks and bureaux de change mangudya said the operating framework of the inter bank foreign exchange market includes denominating the existing rtgs balances bond notes and coins in circulation as rtgs dollars in order to establish an exchange rate between the current monetary balances and foreign currency the rtgs dollars thus become part of the multi currency system in zimbabwe the legal instrument to give effect to this has been prepared the rtgs dollars shall be used by all entities including government and individuals in zimbabwe for the purposes of pricing of goods and services record debts accounting and settlement of domestic transactions the use of rtgs dollars for domestic transactions will eliminate the existence of the multi pricing system and charging of goods and services in foreign currency within the domestic economy he said in this regard prices should remain at their current levels and or to start to decline in sympathy with the stability in the exchange rate given that the current monetary balances have not been changed in this respect the rbz will commit all its efforts to use the instruments at its disposal to maintain stability of the exchange rate the bank has arranged sufficient lines of credit to enable it to maintain adequate foreign currency to underpin the foreign exchange market this is essential to restore the purchasing power of rtgs balances through safeguarding price stability emanating from the pass through effects of exchange rate movements foreign currency from the inter bank market shall be utilised for current bonafide foreign payment invoices except for education fees mangudya said the central bank will tightly monitor the inter bank market in order to eliminate unfair trading banks shall report activities of the inter bank foreign currency market to the bank that shall closely monitor the foreign currency trades on a daily basis using the form and format stipulated by the bank bureaux de change shall be authorised to purchase foreign currency without limits but shall be limited to sell foreign currency for small transactions such as subscriptions business and personal travel up to a maximum aggregate daily limit of us 10 000 per bureau de change like with banks bureaux de change and their agents shall report their activities of the inter bank on a daily basis as required by the bank he further noted that in order to enhance liquidity within the foreign currency market exporters shall be entitled to utilise their retained export receipts within 30 days after which the unutilised export receipts will be offloaded into the market at the prevailing market exchange rate all international remittances and individual funds received from offshore shall continue to be treated as free funds local settlement of nostro fca transfers given the successful completion of the separation of rtgs fcas and nostro fcas the bank is with effect from 25th february 2019 putting in place a local nostro fcas settlement platform to allow for domestic inter bank settlement of nostro fca transfers to anchor price stability mangudya said the reserve bank of zimbabwe shall aggressively intervene in the market to sterilize liquidity so as to help contain inflationary and exchange rate pressures since the last monetary policy statement in october 2018 zimbabwe has witnessed significant changes on the economic front according to the central bank the economy took a different course of direction from a positive economic trajectory to an inflationary environment the foreign exchange premiums on the parallel market which ranged from 1 40 to 1 80 to the us dollar in september 2018 increased to the current levels of between 3 00 to 4 00 this fueled inflation which increased particularly from the september year on year level of 5 4 to 20 9 in october and closed the year at 42 09 on the positive side said mangudya the separation of bank accounts into nostro fcas and rtgs fcas yielded positive results as reflected by the significant increase in the nostro fcas to us 451 2 million as at 31st january 2019 compared to us 240 5 million at the beginning of october 2018 a growth of 87 6 the significant shift in economic fundamentals during the last quarter of 2018 also increased the practice by retailers of charging goods and services on the basis of a multi tier pricing system where a single product has different prices depending on the mode of payment e g usd cash electronic payment mobile money and bond notes this situation has continued to put pressure on the country s balance of payments position the current pricing structure indicates that the majority of transactions in the economy are now largely being conducted in electronic money and bond notes at 7 an implied parallel market exchange rate of around 3 0 to 3 5 to the usd in this respect continuing to use the usd as a unit of account in the economy when its value has drifted away from the value of the rtgs denominated money supply has brought forth a number of challenges the challenges include multi tier pricing by business speculative pricing loss of government revenue valuation and accounting difficulties asset liability mismatches and negative investor confidence he noted that the current monetary arrangements if maintained could pose the risk of a costly re dollarisation of the economy which will move the economy into a recession this is evidenced by the fact that some businesses are already gradually reducing prices due to low demand in the economy moreover some of those charging in foreign currency have also been experiencing reduced demand for their products and are thus reverting to pricing in rtgs and or bond notes

our earnings call transcripts prepared remarks operator good morning and welcome to the owens corning fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call all participants will be in listen only mode operator instructions please note this event is being recorded i would now like to turn the conference over to thierry denis vice president of investor relations mr denis please go ahead thierry denis vice president of investor relations thank you and good morning everyone thank you for taking the time to join us for today s conference call in review of our business results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 joining us today are mike thaman owens corning s chairman and ceo brian chambers chief operating officer and michael mcmurray chief financial officer following our presentation this morning we will open this one hour call to your questions in order to accommodate as many call participants as possible please limit yourselves to one question only earlier this morning we issued a news release and filed a 10 k that detailed our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 for the purposes of our discussion today we have prepared presentation slides that summarize our performance and results and will refer to these slides during this call you can access the earnings press release form 10 k and the presentation slides at our website owenscorning com refer to the investors link under the corporate section of our homepage a transcript and recording of this call and the supporting slides will be available on our website for future reference please reference slide 2 before we begin where we offer a couple of reminders first today s remarks will include forward looking statements based on our current forecasts and estimates of future events these statements are subject to risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially we undertake no obligation to update these statements beyond what is required under applicable securities laws please refer to the cautionary statements and the risk factors identified in our sec filings for a more detailed explanation of the inherent risks and uncertainties affecting such forward looking statements second the presentation slides and today s remarks contain non gaap financial measures explanations and reconciliations of non gaap to gaap measures may be found in the text and financial tables of our earnings press release available on owenscorning com adjusted ebit is our primary measure of period over period comparisons and we believe it is a meaningful measure for investors to compare our results from period to period consistent with our historical practice we have excluded certain items that we believe are not representative of our ongoing operations when calculating adjusted ebit and adjusted earnings we adjust our effective tax rate to remove the effect of quarter to quarter fluctuations which have the potential to be significant in arriving at adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share we also use free cash flow and free cash flow conversion of adjusted earnings as measures helpful to investors to evaluate the company s ability to generate cash and utilize that cash to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value for those of you following along with our slide presentation we will begin on slide 4 and now opening remarks from our chairman and ceo mike thaman will be followed by cfo michael mcmurray and our q a session mike michael h thaman chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you good morning everyone as thierry mentioned i m here today with michael mcmurray our cfo and brian chambers currently our president and coo as we announced last month after 26 years with owens corning and almost 20 years in executive leadership i believe this is the right time for me to retire as ceo effective april 18th i will continue as chairman of the board and i m committed to ensuring a smooth and successful transition i couldn t be more excited that the board has elected brian a strong proven leader with a 15 year career at owens corning to be our next ceo the eighth in the company s 80 year history you ll hear more from brian during the q a portion of the call overall 2018 was a record year with revenues of 7 1 billion and adjusted ebit of 861 million up 11 and 1 respectively over 2017 all three of our businesses produced double digit ebit margins this is the first time in owens corning s history that we ve had this margin performance across the entire portfolio and all three businesses generated ebitda margins close to 20 we faced about 240 million of inflation and higher transportation costs we re able to more than cover this with 255 million of price improvement before i talk about our financial results i d like to give you an update on safety our recordable incident rate for 2018 was 0 52 similar to 2017 this is particularly noteworthy given the successful integration of about 4 700 employees from our recent acquisitions also going into 2019 we established a new record for hours worked between injuries over 3 3 million hours compared with our previous record of about 2 6 million hours in 2013 this represents nearly a full month injury free as a company now i d like to briefly review our financials and our views on 2019 michael will follow with more detail in insulation revenue in 2018 grew 2 7 billion up 36 while ebit increased to 290 million up 113 million and 64 in line with our previous expectations revenue growth was generated mainly by our paroc acquisition and 128 million in price improvement primarily in the north american residential fiberglass insulation business in composites we said that we expected ebit to be approximately 260 million for the year we fell slightly short of this goal with ebit of 251 million on lower volumes in several core markets ebit margins for the year were 12 reflecting manufacturing productivity and lower operating expenses in roofing we delivered 2 5 billion of revenue down 2 with ebit margins of 17 roofing performance for the year was negatively impacted by the reduction in the us market for asphalt shingles as growth in the remodeling and new construction markets were more than offset by lower storm demand despite the decline in the market i m pleased to report that roofing delivered significant price gains of 127 million exceeding asphalt and transportation inflation while the business lagged inflation in the early part of the year we were pleased with our inflation recovery in the second half on today s call you will hear that we are taking a bit of a different approach to our forward guidance first you will note that we ve moved this call to 9 00 am so that investors can benefit from our commentary and presentation from this call before the market opens we are hopeful that this approach will enhance our earnings release second we intend to provide less guidance related to full year ebit at the business segment level we will provide an assessment of our expectations for our markets for the year with more emphasis on near term expectations to help investors understand the current business performance all changes are being made in response to investor feedback and our own analysis on how best to support investor communications michael will provide forward guidance in his comments and then he and brian will lead the q a session i m going to end my remarks where i began we transformed this company over the last decade with thoughtful and disciplined actions that have built a strong company with three market leading businesses with an unconditional commitment to safety working every day to demonstrate our caring for our colleagues in insulation we ve built a strong global business with significant through the cycle earnings power in composites we built a business with market leading platforms in glass non wovens and glass reinforcements to capitalize on favorable industry trends and market growth in roofing we ve driven durable commercial and operational performance and built a components business that generates above market growth and supports sustainable earnings over time and as an enterprise we ve made significant and steady progress from the end of the last downturn and have produced four consecutive years of record performance over the last three years revenue grew 10 annually adjusted ebit and adjusted ebitda improved by about 300 million and 440 million respectively which represents growth of about 15 annually for both these key financial metrics adjusted earnings per share grew at a 24 rate over the same period importantly free cash flow conversion exceeded 100 all of these indicators demonstrate the strength of our company in short we re a company with an improved competitive profile and strong earnings potential with that i ll turn it over to michael to further review the details of our performance michael michael c mcmurray senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you mike and good morning everyone in 2018 we set new records for revenue adjusted ebit and adjusted eps for the full year we grew revenue by 11 to over 7 billion and delivered adjusted ebitda of 1 3 billion in 2018 all three businesses returned ebitda margins close to 20 revenue and ebit results finished in line with expectations for the fourth quarter although free cash flow trailed expectations i will comment more on this later in my prepared remarks we delivered strong operational commercial execution in the fourth quarter despite the challenging market conditions we highlighted on the third quarter call during the quarter we continued to make substantial progress on price the actions taken in 2018 have delivered over 250 million of price improvement for the year offsetting inflation and higher transportation cost for the company now let s start on slide 5 which summarizes our key financial data for the fourth quarter you ll find more detailed financial information in the tables of today s news release and the form 10 k today we reported fourth quarter 2018 consolidated net sales of 1 7 billion up 7 and over 100 million compared to sales reported for the same period in 2017 primarily driven by our insulation business adjusted ebit for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 228 million up 6 compared to 215 million in the same period one year ago adjusted ebit for the quarter improved to a record level despite more challenging market conditions and persistent inflation our quarterly adjusted ebit margin of 13 was in line with last year net earnings attributable to owens corning for the fourth quarter were 171 million compared to a 4 million loss in the same period last year adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 were 152 million or 1 38 per diluted share compared to 125 million or 1 11 per diluted share in 2017 depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter was 110 million up 8 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 the year over year incremental depreciation and amortization from our insulation acquisition was partially offset by lower accelerated depreciation associated with the prior year s composite restructuring actions for the year depreciation and amortization expense was 433 million our capital additions for the year were 542 million up 140 million versus last year primarily driven by growth in productivity projects in the fourth quarter we took advantage of downtime to accelerate our 2019 capital program in addition we closed on a small non wovens acquisition that was treated as capex in the fourth quarter as a result capital additions tracked a bit higher versus our previous expectations free cash flow declined just over 400 million and was below our expectations the main drivers of the year over year decrease were higher inventories and higher capital spend higher inventories were driven by inflation the deceleration of demand we experienced in the second half and a purposeful build in synthetic roofing underlayments in advance of potential tariffs although free cash flow was below our expectation conversion exceeded 100 for the last three years on slide 6 you ll see the detail of our full year 2018 adjusting items reconciling our 2018 reported ebit of 821 million to our adjusted ebit of 861 million for the full year our adjusting items totaled 40 million 19 million were primarily related to restructuring charges resulting from actions announced last year to strengthen the composites low delivered cost position and 21 million were acquisition related costs in our insulation business i d like to highlight a couple more items related to adjusted eps we ve adjusted out a 32 million non cash income tax benefit from a fourth quarter tax litigation settlement in europe this was related to the paroc acquisition and represents a significant win also we finalized our accounting for us tax reform legislation that was enacted in 2017 which resulted in a minor update in 2018 ph to our original estimates these adjustments are described in more detail in the notes of our 10 k now please turn to slide 7 where we provide a high level review of our adjusted ebit performance comparing 2018 to 2017 adjusted ebit increased by 6 million insulation ebit increased by 113 million as compared to the prior year composites ebit decreased by 40 million and roofing ebit decreased by 101 million general corporate expenses were 114 million a 34 million improvement versus the prior year primarily due to lower performance based compensation with that review of key financial highlights i ask you to turn to slide 8 where we provide a more detailed review of our business results beginning with our insulation business sales in insulation for the fourth quarter were 732 million up 23 from the same period a year ago primarily on strong price realization and the contribution of the paroc acquisition partially offset by lower sales volumes ebit for the quarter was 115 million up 36 million compared to the same period in 2017 the ebit improvement was driven primarily by strong price execution and the contribution of paroc these benefits were partially offset by persistent materials and transportation inflation and lower sales volumes insulation delivered strong quarterly ebit and ebitda margins of 16 and 22 respectively for the full year insulation sales were 2 7 billion up 36 compared to 2017 on the contribution from our acquisitions and higher selling prices ebit for the full year of 290 million was 113 million higher as compared to 2017 the benefits from higher selling prices and our acquisitions were partially offset by materials and transportation inflation and higher furnace rebuild costs for the full year we delivered ebit and ebitda margins of 11 and 18 respectively although we continued to face challenging market conditions in the fourth quarter commercial execution was strong across the insulation segment with particular strength in our us residential business we delivered significant price progress in 2018 with further price progress in the fourth quarter for the full year we delivered almost 130 million of price improvement including 41 million in the fourth quarter also we implemented an additional pricing action in january in our us residential business earlier this month we celebrated the one year anniversary of our paroc acquisition i m pleased to report that the integration is progressing per plan paroc delivered solid results in the fourth quarter with ebitda margins of 18 in 2019 we expect a flat macro outlook for the north american residential fiberglass insulation business in this business we expect price carryover from 2018 progress from our early 2019 announcement and any additional pricing actions to be offset by the financial impact of lower volumes and production curtailments given this outlook and our expected lower share of the market in the first half we made significant moves to adjust our north american fiberglass insulation capacity to meet the current demand environment most notably we recently took the decision to take one of our production lines in santa clara california cold in the first quarter the actions we have taken in regards to capacity reductions have been decisive and are consistent with running this business for long term profitability the financial impact of the curtailments will be particularly heavy in the first quarter in the technical and other building insulation businesses we expect revenue and earnings growth driven by improved operating performance and global growth in construction and industrial insulation markets we expect improved operational performance in our us business and strong organic growth in europe with the start up of our new mineral wool facility in poland we also expect to get good organic growth across the globe in most products in the near term our progress in our technical and other building insulation businesses will not overcome the financial impact of lower volumes and curtailment actions in our north american residential fiberglass insulation business as a result we expect first quarter 2019 ebit in insulation to be positive but significantly lag last year now i ll ask you to turn your attention to slide 9 for a review of our composites business sales in composites for the fourth quarter were 481 million down 5 compared to the same period in 2017 the decrease was driven by negative foreign currency translation and slightly lower sales volumes ebit for the quarter was 56 million down compared to 74 million in the same period last year the decrease was primarily driven by higher inflation and to a lesser extent lower sales volumes full year sales were 2 0 billion down 1 compared to the same period in 2017 on lower sales volumes and stable pricing sales volumes were down 2 as broad overall market growth was offset by weakness in a few core markets particularly the us roofing market the business delivered full year ebit of 251 million which was down 40 million from the prior year as higher inflation higher rebuild and start up cost and lower sales volumes more than offset improved manufacturing and lower operating expenses composites maintained double digit margins for the full year delivering ebit and ebitda margins of 12 and 20 respectively from a cost perspective we expect that our recently completed low cost india facility expansion strategic supply alliances in asia and our previously announced high cost melter restructuring actions will drive manufacturing productivity and improve our cost position in 2019 and beyond in 2019 we expect growth in the glass fiber market consistent with global industrial production growth with a more uncertain global economic environment we expect volume growth in line with the broader market and improved operating performance will be offset by inflation ph one additional item of note in composites we are seeing good volumes at the start of 2019 but we expect first quarter 2019 ebit will lag last year primarily due to continued inflationary pressures and a planned furnace rebuild in south korea slide 10 provides an overview of our roofing business roofing sales for the quarter were 546 million down 3 compared with the same period a year ago lower sales volumes partially offset by higher selling prices primarily drove the decline in the fourth quarter our sales volumes trailed market shipments which we believe was primarily as a result of distributor year end buying activity with other manufacturers we believe this late season activity was driven by the desire to achieve rebate gains ph and is not totally reflective of underlying end market demand sales for the full year were 2 5 billion a 2 decrease versus the prior year the us asphalt shingle market declined by 5 as growth in remodeling and new construction markets was more than offset by lower storm demand higher selling prices partially offset the lower sales volumes full year ebit was 434 million a 101 million decrease from the prior year primarily due to lower sales volumes for the full year roofing delivered pricing improvements that exceeded asphalt and transportation inflation our contribution margin dollars per unit consistently improved since the beginning of 2018 ph as we successfully implemented multiple pricing actions despite a weaker demand environment for the full year roofing delivered strong ebit and ebitda margins of 17 and 19 respectively contribution margins entering 2019 are healthy despite asphalt and transportation inflation that was persistent for much of 2018 asphalt prices moderated at the end of 2018 but moved higher in february despite the weakness in the price of oil in addition we are anticipating further asphalt inflation in the first half as a result we ve announced a price increase that will be effective in april the roofing business is positioned to deliver another strong year in 2019 we expect relatively flat us asphalt shingle end market demand with industry shipments slightly below last year assuming average storm demand we expect an above market volume opportunity for owens corning resulting from favorable geographic mix and a higher share of industry shipments in 2019 i wanted to highlight the expectations for first quarter volumes if you recall last year there was significant storm volume carryover into the first quarter and an outlook for a significant asphalt and transportation inflation in addition manufacturers had announced multiple price actions during the first quarter of the year the market environment is different this year and as a result we anticipate our volumes will track lower than last year now let me turn your attention to slide 11 which provides an overview of significant financial matters we repurchased 2 9 million shares of the company s stock in 2018 leaving 4 6 million shares available for repurchase as of the end of 2018 under our current authorization during 2018 we returned 203 million of cash directly to shareholders through share repurchases and 92 million through dividends the company s board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0 22 per share payable on april 2nd 2019 to shareholders of record as of march 8th 2019 the dividend has grown an average of 7 per year since its inception now please turn to slide 12 where i provide more context on our business outlook for 2019 for 2019 the company expects an environment consistent with consensus expectations for global industrial production growth us housing starts and global commercial and industrial construction growth in insulation the company expects a flat macro outlook for the north american residential fiberglass insulation business with positive pricing momentum offset by lower volumes and production curtailments in the technical and other building insulation businesses the company expects earnings growth driven by improved operating performance and growth in global construction and industrial insulation markets in composites the company expects growth in glass fiber markets consistent with global industrial production growth with a more uncertain global economic environment the company expects volume growth and improved operating performance to be offset by inflation in roofing the company expects relatively flat end market demand with industry shipments slightly below last year assuming average storm demand for owens corning the company anticipates a favorable geographic mix comparison and a higher share of industry shipments in 2019 contribution margins entering 2019 position the business for continued strong performance now please turn to slide 13 where i provide more guidance on other financial items for the year as discussed in previous earning calls improved earnings better working capital performance and our advantaged tax position has translated into a strong conversion ratio of adjusted earnings to free cash flow over the past four years in 2018 our results trailed ph our expectations looking forward we have confidence in returning to another year of strong free cash flow generation in 2019 at this time the company plans to prioritize free cash flow to ongoing dividends and making progress in paying down our term loan additional free cash flow could be available for share repurchases under the company s current authorization we expect corporate expenses of 140 million to 150 million with the year over year growth primarily due to the reset of performance based compensations capital additions are expected to total approximately 500 million and includes capital for the completion of paroc s capacity in poland the relocation of our shanghai insulation plant and investments in productivity depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be about 460 million interest expense is expected to be about 130 million as a result of our tax nol foreign tax credits and other planning initiatives we expect our 2019 cash tax rate to be 10 to 12 of adjusted pre tax earnings our 2019 effective tax rate is expected to be 26 to 28 of adjusted pre tax earnings with that i ll turn the call over to thierry to lead us in the question and answer session thierry thierry denis vice president of investor relations thank you michael and we are now ready to begin the q a session questions and answers operator thank you we will now being the question and answer session operator instructions the first question today comes from stephen kim with evercore isi please go ahead stephen kim evercore isi analyst yeah thanks very much guys i guess my first question relates to your comments about the santa clara line going cold or moving to cold in 1q i was wondering if you could give us a little bit more background around that and also dimensionalize what the costs might look like so for example what does this plant make how permanent is this curtailment if you could give us a sense for what those costs associated with that curtailment we can expect will be and if you eventually start this thing up will there be associated start up costs as well on the other side brain chambers president and chief operating officer okay good morning stephen this is brian thanks for that question a lot to unpack there so let me kind of set the stage a little bit when we talk about our first quarter performance and around the curtailment we have our technical insulation business we have our res insulation business this is all around our res insulation business and really tied to volumes and the outlook we see there so we continue to operate our residential insulation business believing that we re not at the top of the roofing cycle or of the i m sorry the housing cycle and but we do expect we re going to see some less volume coming through in the first part of the year primarily due to some softness we re seeing in the overall housing market that s translating through to a demand for our products we also are maintaining our price position and strategy and we believe that that s going to cost us little bit of discretionary share here in the first part of the year and then we are facing some tough comps versus prior year where another manufacturer had some production issues and we picked up some discretionary volume last year that we re not seeing flow through this year so on a year over year basis when we look at our volume outlook through the first part of the year we ve decided to take some proactive steps to curtail some production across our manufacturing lines and then remove some high cost capacity with the facility and with the line in santa clara so we think that curtailments impacts we re taking if i had to dimensionalize the impact there i think we said in the past that an average line is about 2 of industry capacity so i think that should give you a characterization of kind of the capacity that the santa clara line would represent and overall we think curtailment that would represent about a third of our total curtailments we re planning for the business in that space so i think in terms of the length of time in that clearly we ve seen a reduction in the housing market outlook we ve seen estimates come down to a pretty flat year this year and into next year so i think we want to we re optimistic that we could see some housing growth through the year in 19 and into 20 but we want to be realistic in terms of rightsizing our business to make sure that we re delivering on our working capital our cash flow goals in the space so these are actions that we believe are right for us given where we re at in the cycle they are going to have an impact to our 2019 earnings especially in the first quarter but certainly gives us maximum flexibility to respond to the different demand scenarios as they progress this year and into 2020 so operator the next question comes from matthew bouley with barclays please go ahead matthew bouley barclays bank plc analyst hi good morning thank you for taking the questions and i just want to extend my congratulations to mike on his retirement so i guess just following up on that point with insulation specifically so when you mentioned that a lot of these puts and takes in insulation effectively offset this year and please clarify that if that s not correct but in that comment are you assuming future price increases in insulation and really more broadly how are you thinking about future price increases to the extent that they can be realized in 2019 given everything you re saying about the new residential environment thank you brain chambers president and chief operating officer sure thanks for the question yes i mean i think we demonstrated some great success in 2018 around capturing price in the insulation business overall particularly in our res business so we ve got some carryover pricing that s coming into the year we announced our january increase that we are implementing in the space so while we expect to capture some additional price from these actions certainly these increases we think are going to offset the curtailment costs and some of the lower volumes out there we continue to believe in our pricing strategy which is that price is critical to us returning this business to historical profitability levels so we re going to look and see how the year plays out but again we don t believe we re at the top of the cycle and at this point as housing starts progress if we see the growth that is forecast in the back half of the year we think that we get the option of in terms of maintaining price that we have in place and capturing some incremental volume coming back so we think it sets us up well given the variability in the market outlook operator the next question comes from susan maklari with credit suisse please go ahead christopher kalata credit suisse analyst hi this is actually chris on for susan thanks for taking our questions just want to drill in a little deeper into the insulation pricing could you just give us some color on what you ve seen so far in your january price increases and as well as how do you expect industry participants to react to the reduced capacity at santa clara now michael c mcmurray senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah thanks for the question chris so i think i d characterize the environment certainly we saw a softness in demand coming through in the fourth quarter that we ve seen continue kind of into the first part of the year and we think there s a bit of an air pocket that s been created by housing starts coming down when we look at the impact interest rates had on the back half of the year i think we believe that had some impact on that but going forward when you look at the overall macro economy we believe that with household formations with employment growth pricing income growth we think it s a constructive market to see growth in new construction so we want to make sure we re positioning the business to take advantage of that as that comes back to us but certainly we re in an air pocket now that s created a little bit of slack in demand and that s put some pressure on pricing in the near term but again back to our pricing strategy business has been we think it s a key part to return the business to profitability we think holding price at this point certainly gives us the best option to get both price and volume in the second half if ph the new construction market strengthens operator next question comes from michael eisen with rbc capital markets michael eisen rbc capital markets analyst good morning thank you guys for taking the questions wanted to transition to the roofing segment and talk about the price cost dynamics that are at play you talked about an april price increase and the ability to overcome some of the inflation you saw in 18 so thinking out to next year how should we technical difficulty michael h thaman chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah you kind of broke up a little bit i think your question i ll take i think the question more around the outlook on pricing and how we see that playing out in 2019 and margins and performance in our roofing business clearly i think we ve got a great track record in our roofing business to be able to offset asphalt inflation with price i think we demonstrated that through 2018 where even in a weaker volume environment and a lot of inflation coming through to us in terms of asphalt and transportation we were able to get pricing into the market to recover that as michael said in his comments we finished the year with very strong cash contribution margins in the business so i think it demonstrated the value of our product and certainly demonstrated our ability to go get price when we faced inflationary pressures in our roofing business so as we spin that forward into 2019 we ve announced a price increase as we are expecting some continued asphalt and transportation inflation in the business albeit at a more kind of moderate pace than last year but we think where we finished the year in cash contribution margins we were in a we re in a very good position so our pricing philosophy is to go out and recover that upcoming asphalt and transportation inflation to keep those contribution margins strong so i think that gives us a good base from a market volume outlook we believe we re in an environment where if we get some just average storm demand we think we re going to have another constructive demand year in the market so that should give us some opportunity to get a little bit of volume growth as we talked about earlier in the prepared comments with strong margin so we do see a path where we can continue to generate revenue growth and good earnings in our roofing business in 2019 operator the next question comes from john lovallo with bank of america please go ahead john lovallo bank of america analyst hey guys thank you for taking my question i guess in terms of the composites you were talking about volume and improved operating performance offset by inflation how should we think about pricing in that business in 2019 michael c mcmurray senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning so here is what i d say to kind of think about pricing for the composites business this year i mean i think first and foremost i d let you know that overall utilization rates remain quite high so that s a good thing also based on kind of current expectations from a macro perspective we re going to we expect to see decent global growth although there is heightened uncertainty so overall we re probably expecting another year of price stability as you know the current performance of our business from a financial perspective is pretty strong we do a fair amount of competitor analysis as well and we think that the industry leaders are earning strong financial returns as well probably return on capital before tax in the mid teens so we probably don t expect any meaningful price in the near term now we do have a desire to offset inflation with price and so that s no doubt a desire if you look at the long term history for owens corning that hasn t been the fact and actually as a company we ve driven a fair amount of productivity and cost takeout over the last couple of decades to offset inflation as we look at 2019 specifically and look forward we ve gotten a lot done over the last couple of years around our subscale melter restructuring also our low cost india expansion which came online last year and then the strategic supply alliances that we put in place in asia pacific so kind of thinking about thinking about this year again expecting decent global growth although heightened uncertainty we re confident that we re going to improve our operating performance and putting those two together we think that that should largely offset inflation kind of based on kind of current consensus estimates for global industrial production growth now what i would tell you from a longer term perspective two of the larger chinese participants ctg and jushi their parent companies merged and they ve a stated expectation that they re going to merge the glass companies at some point in time date to be determined operator your next question comes from truman patterson with wells fargo please go ahead truman patterson wells fargo analyst hey good morning guys just wanted to touch on your roofing segment it looks like you had a lot of pricing in the fourth quarter it more than offset the asphalt and transportation cost but it seemed like the other inflationary pressures really hit your margins even accounting for some of the loss leverage i guess how should we really think about this other inflationary pressure throughout 2019 and will this continue to kind of eat into margins michael h thaman chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah thanks truman just to kind of characterize a little bit the margin performance in q4 and then i ll talk about some of the other inflation drivers i think when you look through the performance in the fourth quarter this is really primarily a volume issue in the fourth quarter in terms of impacting margins on a year over year basis we just lost a fair amount of operating leverage across our manufacturing facilities in recovering our opex leverage so price was offsetting inflation which is what we expected but we just lost a lot of leverage on the operations side carrying in but i think how to think about that as we go into this year we believe pricing will offset inflation our cash contribution margins are strong i think part of the other impact there a little bit is when you look at the inflation recovery it s kind of a dollar for dollar so we got prices up but 1 price kind of cover a 1 of inflation so while our cash contribution margins have stayed strong at historic levels i think we ve lost a little bit of ebit margin leverage with just that translation between price and inflation so as we come into this year we feel our contribution margins are good we think that the pricing action we ve announced would allow us to stay on top of asphalt and transportation and some of that other inflation that we see coming through we also have a pretty robust productivity program inside all of our businesses to help offset that other material inflation so we feel the margin performance of the business is good and will stay strong in 2019 operator the next question comes from keith hughes with suntrust please go ahead keith hughes suntrust analyst thank you my question is in insulation your comments about 2019 of ebit i believe being positive but being i assume the comment is down pretty substantially in the year is that about residential insulation or about the segment as a whole brain chambers president and chief operating officer thanks keith this is brian so again going back to our insulation business we really have our res business and then our technical insulation and other building materials business so when we re talking about kind of the earnings outlook primarily when we look at our res business i think we ve talked about where we re seeing some positive price momentum but that s really going to be offsetting what we believe to be our curtailment costs and some lower volumes as the year plays out where we re expecting some continued revenue growth really is inside our technical insulation business and this has been a core part of our strategy as we ve looked to really invest to grow this part of the insulation business it gives us access to some new markets different product applications it s a segment or it s a business that s much less price sensitive to some of the volume changes and we feel like that the investments we ve made there are going to generate growth in terms of revenue and earnings moving forward so and we re pretty excited i think our paroc and our foamglas business integrations have gone very very well those businesses are delivering financial performance in line with our expectations we are going to be completing out our paroc investment as michael talked about that gives us additional stone wool capacity in europe we re seeing some positive regulation changes that we think are going to open up additional opportunity for stone wool into building applications there which gives us a growth avenue in north america we re continuing to see growth in our north american mineral wool business in new applications our glass pipe and mechanical businesses so really inside of our technical building insulation business we do expect to see positive growth going forward in 2019 so i think it s really a combination of in our res business we think we re going to be a little challenged based on the volume outlook and housing starts outlook but in our technical insulation business we feel like we ve got good revenue and earnings growth in sight for us in 2019 operator the next question comes from garik shmois with longbow research please go ahead garik shmois longbow research analyst thank you just wanted to ask about roofing can you talk about what you re seeing on core roofing demand excluding storms and it also sounds like there were some channel fill in the fourth quarter on the part of competitors so just wondering if you can speak to inventory levels and how that might impact the ability to get price to offset inflation this year michael h thaman chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes thanks garik so just let me talk a little bit on fourth quarter maybe put some context around that i think we came into the quarter thinking that we were going to see a drop in volumes in the third quarter we saw manufacturing shipments down about 20 and we thought that that could continue into the fourth quarter in fact we saw a little bit of storm demand particularly in colorado carolinas but then as you say a pretty significant impact that we think some distributors that brought in some inventory tied to some incentive gate so we don t think this is any kind of widespread change in behavior but certainly that impacted some of the fourth quarter volumes with inventory coming in that we would normally i think expect to see in 2019 so when i look at that impact as it carries into 2019 if i step back and just look at broad demand drivers we continue to see the reroof remodeling business pretty strong we ve got good contractor visibility and we think that there s good backlog and optimism that there s going to be continued growth there in 2019 i think new construction demand could be a little flat given our outlook on housing starts but i think still when you look at the overall market opportunity assuming a pretty average storm we think we re going to be in a very constructive market environment we think there is opportunities for growth in our business relative to outperforming a little bit of the manufacturing shipments because we weren t shipping into the fourth quarter similar to a few other manufacturers and then in 2018 we had some geographic headwinds a lot of demand up on the east coast that we think that balances out for us so we think inside an average kind of storm year we would expect to see end market demand pretty flat manufacturing shipments might trail a little bit because of the inventory pull through but our volume outlook would be pretty strong and we d see some opportunities for a little bit of growth relative to the opportunity in the market operator the next question comes from justin speer with zelman associates please go ahead justin speer zelman associates analyst thank you i just wanted to unpack if you could i know you ve mentioned it earlier but the free cash conversion in the year particularly relative to what you were thinking even a couple of quarters ago was disappointing so i was wondering if you can unpack that for us and then talk to what you think you re going to be able to achieve in 2019 michael c mcmurray senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you justin a couple of things so let me kind of set it up and then i ll take you through kind of what transpired throughout the year but you know i think first and foremost if you look back over the last four years the free cash flow performance for the company has actually been a big bright spot and then the improvements that we ve made in working capital had been very very significant in the years 15 16 and 17 talking specifically about our 2018 results you would have heard us on the third quarter call highlight that we were going to track below kind of our 100 conversion goal for the year actual results actually tracked lower than that again kind of thinking about it year on year primarily working capital related and then some higher capex about half each now if you think about the goal that we laid out some years ago around generating average conversion of a 100 over a three year period looking specifically to last year we were probably about 200 million of free cash flow better than that goal and then looking specifically at this year or 18 we were about 300 million worse than our goal specifically looking at 2017 we hung up a fair amount of payables on the balance sheet related to capex and so that was a tailwind for 17 and a headwind for 18 to the tune of about 60 million still if you look over the last three years or you look over the last four years we ve generated free cash flow conversion slightly in excess of 100 now for the year 2019 we expect another strong year of cash flow and free cash flow conversion now thinking about some of the headwinds that we faced in 18 to talk maybe give you a little bit more color around working capital specifically the primary driver was related to inventories the biggest build in that space would have been within our roofing business and really in two key areas half of it would have been roughly related to asphalt inflation and then the other half would have been related to purposeful or conscious build of coated wovens inventory here in the us that s coming from china and we were getting that inventory here on the ground in advance of potential tariffs and then lastly due to the kind of underlying market slowing down late q3 and into q4 we did see some inventory build in our two businesses that melt glass those assets are hard to turn on a dime and then within composites specifically we had a bit of a purposeful build related to some of the asset moves that we ve made around small melters and the new asset that we were building or bringing up in india so again looking to 19 so i think we have confidence that we re going to return to another year of strong free cash flow generation clearly we re not going to face the same headwinds that we did in 2018 and i think that working capital inventories in particular are going to be a source of free cash flow you heard us talk in our prepared remarks you heard us talk in q a that we re taking some pretty significant curtailment actions in our insulation business justin speer zelman associates analyst one more question operator the next question comes from michael wood with nomura instinet mason marion nomura instinet analyst hi this is mason marion on for mike in composites what are your rebuilding expense assumptions in 2019 relative to 2018 and then any update on trends within the indian wind market thank you michael h thaman chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah from a rebuild perspective i ll help you out thinking about it this way so last year essentially we had two rebuilds this year we re expected to have two rebuilds the difference last year is that we re also bringing up our new facility in india so that would have been a little bit of a headwind so when you think about kind of manufacturing costs year on year that should be a bit of a tailwind and then regards to the india wind market while it was a disappointment most of last year and came back slower than what we had anticipated we made progress in the third quarter of last year we ve made progress in the fourth quarter of last year and we re anticipating progress this year as well so momentum is building it s headed in the right direction operator the next question comes from michael rehaut with jpmorgan please go ahead elad hillman jpmorgan analyst hi this is elad on for mike i just wanted to dig in a little bit deeper on the roofing volumes at the in 4q and then going forward was there something in particular driving the year end rebates from other manufacturers or is this something that you ve seen in the past and then what have you seen so far this year with distributor buying trends and how much of an impact from the inventory pull through do you expect thanks brain chambers president and chief operating officer thanks for the questions this is brian you know volume incentives are not uncommon practices inside the roofing business i think so that s not unusual to kind of see some of those incentive structures put in place for distributors i think it s a little unusual to see what we believe is pretty significant inventory buy in as a result of that and again i think that was a combination of these incentives being set at the beginning of the year against specific volume gates and as the year progressed it was a little slower than the prior year and so i think that caused some distributors to make an economic decision to weigh ph bringing in inventory against an incentive or kind of letting it go and pushing it into 2019 and clearly there was enough of incentive for some distributors to want to do that but again i think it was a handful that participated and certainly not widespread in that space so i think as we roll that into our outlook for 2019 again overall i don t think that any of those moves impacted out the door sales or our contractor share positions in the market i just think it pulled forward some of the manufacturing shipment demand that we ll see in 2019 so in 2019 we expect end markets to stay pretty strong but manufacturing shipments to trail on a full year basis as a result of this i think as i as i think about how that s going to play out in q1 i do think that inventory pull will have an impact on q1 purchases so i think as we look at the shape of the year versus last year we re expecting a little softer q1 where we would see significantly less storm demand on a year over year basis again 17 was pretty strong in a storm year and we had a fair amount of carryover into the first quarter of 18 we re not seeing that kind of carryover we think there is going to be some impact on some of this pre buy activity for some of the distributors and also i think the third component that s going to shape the year a little differently is you know last year we were in a very high inflationary environment we had a couple of spring increases announced so that gave distributors a lot of incentive to buy earlier in the year ahead of the season much more than this year so we think this year we re going to see some more volume drift into the second quarter just as normal kind of buying pattern out of distributors that they buy ahead of the season on that space so i think that s going to shape the first quarter and first half a little differently in terms of distributor buying ph but i think again on a full year basis in end market we think it s still going to be pretty strong for us operator next question comes from scott schrier with citi please go ahead scott schrier citi analyst hi good morning i just wanted to ask you about insulation taking into account all the comments that you made yes we re going to have a weaker 1q which is seasonably light anyway you re making the curtailments with a little volume environment and with good pricing how should we think about your incremental margins maybe with respect to some of the numbers you ve communicated in the past as being a mid cycle average and then more broadly speaking long term do you still think after some of these actions that that s still the correct way to think about the business from an incremental margin perspective brain chambers president and chief operating officer yeah let me frame it a little bit maybe i ll ask mike to jump in on some of the historical piece i mean i think that the outlook in terms of volumes that we see growing through the year we do expect we re going to need a little bit of positive market momentum to maintain our volume space and allows us to then look at additional pricing but i think overall the margin carry that we have today is solid but we re not at historical levels so we continue to want to push the performance of the res side of the business up even further so i guess mike maybe i ll ask you to make a few comments on that historic point michael c mcmurray senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah thanks brian i d be happy to try to add something there scott i think it s a good question i mean we talked about the business historically as being an operating leverage story and i think during the period of time where we began that narrative probably in the 2013 2014 time frame it really was a res improvement story i mean res at that time was losing money we had visibility to improved housing starts that are going to drive our utilization give us a leverage in our economics give us a leverage maybe to get a little bit better pricing environment so those two things combined caused us to see the top line and bottom line in insulation was going to be largely driven by a significant improvement in res in the environment we re in today we ve obviously dramatically built out the technical insulation side of the business we ve diversified the business to europe we ve diversified the business across multiple technologies on the technical side that s a much more stable pricing environment which is in today s environment not giving us a tremendous amount of leverage but it is a very good news in a downturn we like those businesses because they tend to be much more stable in the ups and much more stable in the down so i think with the mix of business today it s probably hard to see an overall operating leverage story for the entire insulation business that would be at the kind of levels we had talked about previously now for res i think we would still think that s a business that can produce that kind of leverage specifically to 2019 we re talking about a year where there is an offset price on the positive volume and curtailment on the negative those offsetting as we go through the year depending on how the second half comes out so i don t think res is today a big part of the story of how we would see improvement in insulation in 2019 but i do think as we look through the cycle we d continue to expect with some volume growth back in res that we d get back to operating leverage on the res side of the ledger thierry denis vice president of investor relations yeah anita it s thierry it looks like we re probably at the end of the q a session right anita operator we have the next question comes from ken zener with keybanc kenneth zener keybanc analyst good morning gentlemen hello operator and do you have a question thierry denis vice president of investor relations ken we can hear you kenneth zener keybanc analyst okay i couldn t hear you sorry about that thierry last question yet again appreciate that color and the new approach gentlemen for insulation the i understand the annual comments that you gave i think it s good that you re talking about the first quarter pressure my single question is can you talk about the first half expectations for housing activity versus your expectations for the second half so if consensus is flat i m just trying to see how much downside you re seeing in the first half versus a potential recovery in the second half thank you very much brain chambers president and chief operating officer yeah thanks ken i mean look we think right now if we look at expectations for housing starts it s kind of a mirror effect to what we saw in 18 so we think that that decline was in the back half of last year sloping down and we believe this year we would start to see progression and positive movement of the housing starts as we move into q2 and through the rest of the year so that s the progression of housing starts from a market opportunity that we re planning for that s the biggest uncertainty around our res is going to be a little bit of that macro timing on when those housing starts actually materialize and when that then flows through to demand for us so that s something that we re not expecting a lot of volume growth in the first half of this year as a result of that and we think that carries through and creates a stronger second half for us if that materializes thierry denis vice president of investor relations thank you brian and i think this concludes the q a session and with that i d like to thank everybody for joining today s call and i d like to hand it over back to mike for some closing comments michael h thaman chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you thierry to summarize 2018 was another record year for the company notably for the first time in our company s history all three of our businesses achieved double digit margins at the same time as i think about the past decade we ve built a resilient company we ve accomplished this through sustainable productivity improvements organic investments and acquisitions today we have a more diversified portfolio that s better able to generate strong cash flow deliver consistent performance and generate attractive returns for our investors across the cycle i m proud for brian to have the opportunity to lead owens corning he has been instrumental in driving value in our roofing business and at the enterprise level he is dedicated to our customers our businesses and our employees he understands teamwork and how to get teams to perform at the highest level i ve worked closely with brian throughout much of my time as ceo and have full confidence in him to lead this great company forward it s been my distinct pleasure to call

the global economy in terms of gdp per capita grew by 32 percent between 1990 and 2010 this growth has helped lift more than a billion people worldwide out of poverty nearly cutting in half the 1990 global poverty rate the global economy in terms of gdp per capita grew by 32 percent between 1990 and 2010 this growth has helped lift more than a billion people worldwide out of poverty nearly cutting in half the 1990 global poverty rate however using the same yardstick for measuring poverty across the developing world and defining poverty as earning 1 25 or less per person per day adjusted for price differences across the world the number of nigerians in poverty between 1992 and 2010 increased to 70 percent of the population an increase of 22 percent from the rate in 1992 clearly global growth was not good for nigeria s most vulnerable citizens the poor were not lifted by the rising tide instead they were left to sink as of 2010 7 out of 10 nigerians were considered poor and according to a study from the center for global development most of the poor are from the north of the country with more than two thirds at risk of spending their lifetime in poverty this is despite a rise in the country s gdp per capita by about 19 percent and a decline in the level of inequality growth that reduces poverty is sometimes called pro poor growth also referred to as the twin goals of the world bank because it helps the poor escape poverty and it raises in relative terms their average living standard at a rate faster than the rest of the population however the widely accepted theory that holds that growth is good for the poor simply does not apply in the case of nigeria where impressive growth numbers alone failed to reduce rampant poverty indeed growth in some cases had no impact on poverty whatsoever to offer a theory that runs directly counter to this popular myth i used survey data from nigeria with a sample size of about 78 000 households fielded between 1992 and 2010 to answer this question of why nigeria s growth isn t helping the country s poor two sets of information are necessary the amount of money households spend on goods and services which gives an idea of the average household living standard and a poverty line a measure that separates the poor from the nonpoor in monitoring progress against poverty the world bank uses an absolute poverty line of 1 25 per person per day accounting for purchasing power parity that is equivalent to approximately 353 nigerian naira per person per day based on the january 2019 consumer price index enough to buy a light lunch or half a gallon of gas in nigeria but not a starbucks coffee in the united states in the period from 1985 to 1992 nigeria s economy during the structural adjustment program expanded the average living standard of nigerian households rose by more than 26 percent relative to 1985 while the average living standard of the poor rose by a very small margin just over 1 percent this is because the growth came with a rise in the level of inequality the gap between the rich and everyone else measured by gini index widened by 16 percent moreover the poorest of the poor or the bottom 23 percent saw a significant decline in their average living standard the upper middle class gained more than the poor but less than the richest 15 percent based on analysis of the data it is clear that rising inequality in nigeria between 1985 and 1992 prevented nearly 7 million of the country s poor from escaping poverty they were ill prepared to take advantage of opportunities being offered by growth as most of them did not have the labor market skills that were in demand in other words inequality disadvantaged the poor in terms of opportunity growth the second growth period from 1996 to 2004 tells a different story the average living standard of the poor rose more in terms of share of total income this was due in part to a decline in the level of inequality due to rising growth and declining inequality occurring simultaneously roughly 13 million nigerians were able to escape poverty this period also coincided with the return to a democratic government in 1999 a series of economic reforms in the banking and telecom industries and a rise in nominal public sector wages and pensions nigerian policymakers looking to learn from the past should ask two questions why was the first growth spell less pro poor than the second and how can future growth be made more pro poor the data shows that growth accompanied by declining inequality does more to reduce poverty than growth accompanied by rising inequality the conditions under which the 1996 2004 growth occurred may be different from today s and there is no guarantee that applying the same approach will lead to the same result but it s worth a try although there is a general recognition that nigeria is highly unequal it is hard to quantify inequality because of the lack of up to date data but there is a broader point those in developing economies care less about income inequality than they do about living in poverty in other words their primary goal is getting people out of poverty moreover nigeria s abundance of natural resources attracts corruption and corruption weakens institutions and when institutions are weak oil revenues wind up benefiting the wealthy few mostly top government officials and their friends and relatives at the expense of the country s majority since a lack of skills prevents the poor from participating in new economic opportunities pro poor growth can be enhanced through investing in the human capital of the poor namely their education and income generating skills at the moment there is a widespread lack of access to the financial resources needed for investments in human capital because there is no system in place as in the developed world where young nigerians can access student loans to finance their college educations as a result social mobility has been stagnant in nigeria for decades high paying jobs simply go to those with high quality degrees and high quality degrees are a function of a high quality education because high quality education is a function of high quality primary and secondary schools and students can seldom obtain a high quality primary and secondary educational foundation from nigerian public schools nowadays families have to buy these credentials from a private school one needs a large amount of money to buy a high quality private education if your parents are poor you cannot buy a private school education and so the children of the rich will always get the well paid jobs this cycle reinforces and maintains the widening inequality of opportunity in nigeria the challenge for the next government therefore is to generate more growth while at the same time dealing with inequality and reducing poverty whoever wins the election should take two steps first since nigeria is an oil rich country it should attempt to implement a proposal developed by todd moss and his colleagues at the center for global development using oil revenues to make direct cash transfers to the poor counting such transfers as income and subjecting them to taxation a policy that would enhance accountability and reduce official corruption although the current government is running a cash transfer program of 5 000 naira approximately 14 per month per household this won t bring relief because fewer than 1 per cent of poor people are benefiting and the amount isn t enough to boost the welfare of the poor in an economy currently experiencing inflation without an increase and an expansion of the number of beneficiaries it won t do much to reduce poverty second the next government should set up a u s style council of economic advisors made up of academic experts that advises the president not based on politics not based on narrow interests but based on the best evidence as former u s president barack obama once said of his own council at the moment nigeria has no impartial economic team that guides and shapes the decisions of its president state governors and the vice president sit on a national economic council but it is a far cry from the u s system it is clear that most of nigeria s economic problems are partly the outcome of unintended flawed economic policies tackling inequality directly and bringing nonpartisan advice will not end poverty in nigeria but it would help ensure that future growth helps the country s poorest citizens rather than being squandered
it s been said that talk is cheap but investors seem to not think so when it comes to the ongoing trade negotiations between the united states and china participants in equities markets around the

of the business terminals on the lower mississippi river the agreements will see imtt deploy approximately 75 0 million of growth capital over the upcoming 12 to 24 month period at its avondale la terminal imtt will construct storage capacity and related infrastructure including a new ship dock in support of a palm oil processing facility being developed on land leased by imtt to fuji vegetable oil fuji the project features 87 000 barrels of new capacity being built pursuant to a 30 year use agreement with fuji and 100 000 barrels of existing capacity that is expected to be used by a feedstock supplier the facility is expected to be in service in late 2020 imtt has leased 442 000 barrels of capacity including 80 000 barrels of capacity to be constructed at its terminal in gretna la to a customer who will market highly refined oils through the terminal as a part of the long term agreement imtt will also construct a truck loading facility in support of the customer the project is expected to be in service in early 2020 both the avondale and gretna projects are a part of ongoing efforts to invest in the infrastructure of imtt and are subject to customary pre construction permitting atlantic aviation atlantic aviation generated ebitda excluding non cash items of 264 7 million in 2018 an increase of 7 0 compared with 2017 driven by full year contributions from acquisitions of fixed base operations in 2017 increased hangar rental income and ancillary services fees free cash flow produced by atlantic aviation increased slightly with the higher earnings substantially offset by higher taxes and interest expense excluding airports at which traffic was restricted as a result of runway closures for portions of the year flight activity at the airports on which atlantic aviation operates increased by 0 6 in 2018 based on data reported by the federal aviation administration mic hawaii mic hawaii generated ebitda excluding non cash items of 37 3 million in 2018 down 38 5 versus 2017 including 17 1 million of write downs and approximately 5 5 million of negative ebitda both related to a mechanical contracting business that was sold in november these were partially offset by increased utility margins at hawaii gas resulting from a rate increase implemented in july 2018 free cash flow produced by mic hawaii declined 42 3 to 22 4 million as a result of the losses generated by the mechanical contractor and higher maintenance capital expenditures and interest expense partially offset by a decrease in cash taxes corporate and other mic s corporate and other segment generated ebitda excluding non cash items of 19 1 million in 2018 compared with 15 5 million in 2017 primarily as a result of higher transaction expenses and professional fees related to addressing various shareholder matters partially offset by the absence of costs associated with the implementation of a shared services center free cash flow produced by corporate and other declined 80 9 to 20 5 million as a result of higher interest expense and a reduced tax benefit the corporate and other segment includes primarily fees payable to mic s manager professional fees and expenses associated with being a public company and any revenue or expense associated with smaller businesses that individually or collectively do not constitute a reportable segment mic also reports transaction related expenses any profit share income to which mic was entitled related to the sale of renewable power generation projects by a third party developer and shared services costs not otherwise allocated to operating companies in its corporate and other segment in december mic announced that it had completed the refinancing of the primary debt facility of atlantic aviation and extended the maturity dates of two of three facilities at imtt these actions extended the weighted average maturity of mic s debt to 5 7 years and provided the capital to fund the repayment of 349 9 million of convertible notes due in july 2019 following the repayment of the convertible notes mic does not currently have any debt facilities that mature prior to 2022 discontinued operations in october 2018 mic completed the sale of the bayonne energy center bec and commenced a sale process involving its solar and wind power generation facilities these businesses all of which had been reported as components of mic s contracted power segment were classified as discontinued operations and the contracted power segment was eliminated the company s financial results for 2018 and the prior years have been restated to reflect the impact of these changes the discontinued operations generated net income of 29 6 million in 2018 an increase of 32 6 compared with 2017 and ebitda excluding non cash items of 98 9 million up 5 9 versus 2017 the increases were driven by contributions from the expansion of bec and improved wind resources free cash flow produced by the discontinued operations increased 3 8 to 67 9 million 2019 guidance mic initiated guidance with respect to ebitda and free cash flow from continuing operations and ebitda by segment for 2019 the company expects a modest contribution from its discontinued operations solar and wind power generation will be additive to its guidance through the anticipated date of sale of these assets in the second quarter with respect to the company s guidance for ebitda and free cash flow in 2019 a reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss the most comparable gaap measure and a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash from operating activities the most comparable gaap measure are not available without unreasonable effort due to the company s limited visibility into and inability to make accurate projections and estimates of items including management fees hedging agreements depreciation and any benefit provision for income taxes these items may vary greatly from year to year and could significantly impact mic s results as reported in accordance with gaap international matex tank terminals storage utilization at imtt is expected to average in a mid 80s percent range in 2019 and to end the year in a high 80s percent range subject to market conditions the company expects the improvement to be more pronounced in the second half of the year the 2019 utilization rate estimates assume that only a portion of the storage related to a now idle refinery owned by a third party is leased during 2019 and that demand for bulk liquid storage increases as market participants prepare for the scheduled implementation of new rules instituted by the international maritime organization concerning reductions in the sulphur content of bunker fuel in january of 2020 the contribution to ebitda associated with the recovery in utilization is expected to be partially offset by a further decline in average storage rates and higher operating costs in the first quarter of 2019 imtt is expected to receive approximately 39 0 million in proceeds related to the termination of an agreement with the owner of a refinery at imtt s terminal in st rose la the proceeds have been incorporated into the company s guidance for imtt ebitda in 2019 of between 287 0 and 297 0 million excluding the termination fee ebitda is therefore be expected to be between 248 0 and 258 0 million the forecast decline of approximately 12 reflects primarily the loss of revenue associated with storage related to the refinery increased expenses and lower storage rates primarily related to the renewal of older out of market contracts all partially offset by improved utilization including of repurposed capacity atlantic aviation mic s guidance for ebitda from atlantic aviation of between 275 0 and 285 0 million in 2019 assumes historically normal growth in general aviation flight activity of approximately 2 5 the guidance does not contemplate acquisitions of additional fbos mic hawaii guidance for the company s mic hawaii segment for ebitda of between 60 0 and 65 0 million in 2019 assumes a full year benefit of the rate increase implemented in the regulated portion of hawaii gas in july of 2018 and the absence of write downs and losses attributable to a business that was sold in 2018 partially offset by increases in the cost of propane hedges in the unregulated portion of that business growth investments growth capital expenditures across the mic portfolio are expected to total between 275 0 and 300 0 million in 2019 of this the company reports having already committed to expenditures with an aggregate value of 247 0 million given the attractiveness of the opportunities at imtt and the tax benefits associated with investment in high value physical asset backed projects the company estimates that the majority of its 2019 growth capital expenditures will be made in support of imtt maintenance capital expenditures mic expects the amount of capital deployed in maintaining its businesses will be between 65 0 and 70 0 million in 2019 the expected spend is higher than the long term average for the company primarily as a result of planned expenditures related to the refurbishment of a pier at imtt in bayonne nj maintenance capital expenditures are expected to remain elevated for two to three years depending of the pace of the refurbishment ebitda guidance by segment summarized imtt 287 0 297 0 million atlantic aviation 275 0 285 0 million mic hawaii 60 0 65 0 million corporate other 12 0 million total 610 0 635 0 million free cash flow mic expects free cash flow from continuing operations in 2019 to be in a range between 400 0 and 445 0 million the guidance contemplates higher cash interest related to an increase in the interest rate on debt at atlantic aviation partially offset by the anticipated repayment of 349 9 million of holding company convertible notes in july of 2019 using a portion of the proceeds raised in the atlantic aviation refinancing free cash flow is also expected to be reduced by higher maintenance capital expenditures in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily in relation to increased spending at imtt associated with the

additional information please visit the mic website at www macquarie com mic mic g use of non gaap measures earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda excluding non cash items free cash flow and proportionately combined metrics in addition to mic s results under u s gaap the company uses certain non gaap measures to assess the performance and prospects of its businesses in particular mic uses ebitda excluding non cash items free cash flow and certain proportionately combined financial metrics proportionately combined financial metrics including free cash flow reflect mic s proportionate interest in its solar and wind facilities substantially all of which are in discontinued operations mic measures ebitda excluding non cash items as a reflection of its businesses ability to effectively manage the volume of products sold or services provided the operating margin earned on those transactions and the management of operating expenses independent of the capitalization and tax attributes of those businesses the company believes investors use ebitda excluding non cash items primarily as a measure to assess the operating performance of its businesses and to make comparisons with the operating performance of other businesses whose depreciation and amortization expense may vary widely from mic s particularly where acquisitions and other non operating factors are involved mic defines ebitda excluding non cash items as net income loss or earnings the most comparable gaap measure before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and non cash items including impairments unrealized derivative gains and losses adjustments for other non cash items and pension expense reflected in the statements of operations ebitda excluding non cash items also excludes base management fees and performance fees if any whether paid in cash or stock because mic has varied ownership interest in the businesses within its portfolio of solar and wind power generation facilities in discontinued operations but has an obligation to report their financial results on a consolidated basis gaap measures such as net income loss do not fully reflect its proportionate share of the cash generated by these businesses the company notes that the proportionately combined metrics used may be calculated in a different manner by other companies and may limit their usefulness as a comparative measure therefore proportionately combined metrics should be used as a supplemental measure to help understand mic s financial performance and not in lieu of financial results reported under gaap the company s businesses can be characterized as owners of high value long lived assets capable of generating substantial free cash flow mic defines free cash flow as cash from operating activities the most comparable gaap measure which includes cash interest tax payments and pension contributions less maintenance capital expenditures which includes principal repayments on capital lease obligations used to fund maintenance capital expenditures and excludes changes in working capital management uses free cash flow as a measure of its ability to provide investors with an attractive risk adjusted return by sustaining and potentially increasing mic s quarterly cash dividend and funding a portion of the company s growth gaap metrics such as net income loss do not provide mic management with the same level of visibility to into the performance and prospects of the business as a result of i the capital intensive nature of mic s businesses and the generation of non cash depreciation and amortization ii shares issued to the company s external manager under the management services agreement iii the company s ability to defer all or a portion of current federal income taxes iv non cash unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments v amortization of tolling liabilities vi gains losses on disposal of assets and vii pension expense pension expenses primarily consist of interest expense expected return on plan assets and amortization of actuarial and performance gains and losses any cash contributions to pension plans are reflected as a reduction to free cash flow and are not included in pension expense management believes that external consumers of its financial statements including investors and research analysts use free cash flow both to assess the company s performance and as an indicator of its success in generating an attractive risk adjusted return in its annual report on form 10 k the company has disclosed free cash flow on a consolidated basis and for each of its operating segments and mic corporate management believes that both ebitda excluding non cash items and free cash flow support a more complete and accurate understanding of the financial and operating performance of its businesses than would otherwise be achieved using gaap results alone free cash flow does not take into consideration required payments on indebtedness and other fixed obligations or other cash items that are excluded from mic s definition of free cash flow management notes that free cash flow may be calculated differently by other companies thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure free cash flow should be used as a supplemental measure to help understand mic s financial performance and not in lieu of its financial results reported under gaap see tables above and below for a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations to ebitda excluding non cash items from continuing operations and to adjusted ebitda excluding non cash items from continuing operations and a reconciliation from cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations to free cash flow from

classification of maintenance capital expenditures and growth capital expenditures mic categorizes capital expenditures as either maintenance capital expenditures or growth capital expenditures as neither maintenance capital expenditure nor growth capital expenditure is a gaap term the company has adopted a framework to categorize specific capital expenditures in broad terms maintenance capital expenditures primarily maintain mic s businesses at current levels of operations capability profitability or cash flow while growth capital expenditures primarily provide new or enhanced levels of operations capability profitability or cash flow management considers a number of factors in determining whether a specific capital expenditure will be classified as maintenance or growth in some cases specific capital expenditures contain characteristics of both maintenance and growth capital expenditures mic does not bifurcate specific capital expenditures into growth and maintenance components each discrete capital expenditure is considered within the above framework and the entire capital expenditure is classified as either maintenance or growth forward looking statements this

the international monetary fund imf has revised down its predictions for global growth in 2019 and 2020 it forecasts growth to be 3 5 in 2019 and 3 6 in 2020 this means a dampening of global growth over the next two years as growth in 2018 is estimated to be 3 7 the slowdown will affect both advanced and emerging economies growth in advanced economies in 2019 was revised down to 2 0 from 2 1 but the 2020 projection of 1 7 remains the same the revision is not only because of lower expected growth for the euro area but also because us growth is expected to decline growth in emerging economies in 2019 is now predicted to be 4 5 revised down from 4 7 the trade tensions will hit china and its neighbours with lower growth as a result the shipping industry feels the impact of this trade war especially in the dry bulk market while there were high container volumes on the front haul eastbound transpacific trade lane in q4 2018 this is unlikely to continue into 2019 given that companies have filled up their inventories and there is uncertainty over future tariffs the us has now imposed tariffs on more than usd 250bn worth of chinese imports and china has retaliated with tariffs on usd 113bn of imports from the us europe growth is predicted to slow in the eu with several of the major economies bringing it down in germany the fall in growth from 1 5 in 2018 to 1 3 in 2019 is because of low domestic demand lower industrial production on the back of new standards on car emissions and the impact of the trade war on foreign demand italian growth in 2019 has been revised down to 0 6 from 1 0 because of high borrowing costs and weak domestic demand industrial action and the yellow vest protests have also resulted in lower growth expectations in france for 2019 and the imf now sees french growth as being unchanged from 2018 at 1 5 at the time of writing brexit is less than two months away but huge uncertainty remains over the terms of the uk s departure from the european union the withdrawal agreement was heavily defeated in the british parliament but with no clear majority for any solution on the table a delayed departure date or a no deal brexit is becoming more likely as the days pass the actual effect of a no deal brexit remains unclear the manufacturing purchasing managers index pmi in the euro area fell throughout 2018 from 60 6 in december 2017 to 51 4 in december 2018 with the pmi for january coming in at 50 5 the start of a new year has not brought an end to this prolonged decline we use the pmi as an indicator for where shipping demand is heading because it reflects the condition of the related key manufacturing sector after the us withdrawal from the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa and the re imposed sanctions on iran germany france and the uk have announced the creation of a special purpose vehicle named instex this will allow european businesses to avoid us sanctions and continue trading with iran european businesses have mostly followed the us sanctions to protect their interests in the us us growth in the us remains stronger than in other advanced economies but is expected to fall to 2 5 in 2019 and 1 8 in 2020 according to the imf the longest government shutdown on record was suspended in late january after 35 days however the government may shut down again on 15 february if negotiations fail for a permanent agreement to deliver funds to run the federal government in 2019 the direct economic impact of the shutdown was not the only effect while federal workers were sent home they were unable to fulfil their usual role in trade facilitation making it harder for us importers and exporters to conduct business delayed releases of economic and international trade data at a crucial time in trade negotiations have also been part of the fallout on the positive side the us mexico and canada have agreed a new trade deal which replaces the north american free trade agreement the deal awaits ratification and the impact on trade between the three countries remains uncertain reducing its trade deficit with china is one of the main aims of the us in the ongoing negotiations to end the trade war but in 2018 the tariffs had the opposite effect with frontloading ahead of rising tariffs in 2018 china reported a trade surplus of usd 323 3bn with the us exports grew 11 3 year on year while imports were only up 0 7 from 2017 asia growth in china remains high and well above the global average but the direction of it is clearly south bound a tightening of financial markets and monetary policy combined with the trade war have led to slowing growth the imf reported 6 9 growth in 2017 declining to 6 6 in 2018 and 6 2 in 2019 and 2020 in response to this the chinese authorities have already started and are expected to continue implementing fiscal policies to stimulate the economy and ease the pace of the slowdown dry bulk and tanker shipping sectors will be particularly harmed by a chinese slowdown and with overall imports falling in december these sectors are already being affected china s official pmi was at 49 5 in january up from the 49 4 in december but still below the threshold of 50 a pmi of 50 indicates no change from the previous month and anything below 50 a contraction while chinese exports remained high in q4 2018 this was largely down to frontloading by us buyers because of anticipated tariff hikes and so is unlikely to continue into 2019 the new orders index fell to 49 6 in january the second month of contraction outlook risks are piling up with warning signs emerging around the globe the next few months will prove very interesting for the shipping industry the venezuelan crisis and the new brazilian president will probably influence south american trade while the whole world will be watching closely for official announcements from china and the us regarding the outcome of trade talks the two countries agreed to put tariff hikes on hold during a three month window in the hope of coming to a satisfactory deal and stopping this trade war if however no deal is reached tariffs on usd 200bn worth of us imports from china will rise from 10 to 25 on 2 march with a chinese retaliation likely any escalation of the trade war will further harm the shipping industry at a time when it is already struggling the global manufacturing pmi fell to 50 7 in january its lowest level since august 2016 with ihs markit forecasting a relatively lacklustre outlook new export orders for goods also fell in january coming in at 49 4 the shipping industry should brace for slowing demand growth in 2019 source peter sand chief shipping analyst bimco

the medium term budget policy statement mtbps as presented by minister of finance tito mboweni last was given against the realisation of the staggering impact state capture had on the south african economy strained fiscal numbers and ongoing concerns regarding the risks of further credit rating downgrades was mr mboweni able to address the glaring revenue shortfalls ever increasing debt to gdp and strain of state owned enterprises soe s on the fiscus kemp munnik head of structured solutions at bravura an independent investment banking firm specialising in corporate finance and structured solutions re looks at those key aspects which came out of the mid term budget policy statement mtbps and which should guide mboweni s roadmap for budget 2019 the mtbps framework is significant because it provides insight into planned government expenditure and indicates expected tax increases that south african taxpayers may have to face it also informs decisions of the credit rating agencies about south africa s fiscal stability revision of growth forecast south africa s economy is shrinking with unemployment at a 14 year high of 27 7 or 37 2 if the definition of unemployed is expanded to include those too discouraged to look for work the south african reserve bank announced earlier this year that sa is in a technical recession following two consecutive quarters of negative growth in the mtbps the national treasury forecasts that gdp growth will slow to 0 7 in 2018 down from 1 3 in 2017 before rising to 1 7 in 2019 and 2 1 in 2020 the global economy is expected to continue growing at 3 7 in 2018 and 2019 although global risks are becoming more pronounced revenue shortfall and significant increase in budget deficit the mtbps states that in 2017 18 for the first time since the 2008 global financial crisis tax revenue growth did not exceed gdp growth revenue shortfalls have widened over the past four years with under collections rising from r7 4 billion in 2014 15 to r49 billion in 2017 18 the mtbps announced that there will be a revenue shortfall of r27 4 billion relative to the 2018 budget estimate this is due to weaker economic growth alongside a once off payment of overdue vat refunds these revenue shortfalls lead to budget deficits the mtbps states that the 2018 19 consolidated budget deficit is estimated to widen to 4 3 of gdp this is by far the highest level ever seen since 2008 a glimmer of hope no increases in taxes the mtbps states that increases in the major tax instruments would be avoided unless the economic environment requires it at this stage revenue projections assume no changes to tax rates but provide for annual adjustments to personal income tax brackets levies and excise duties in line with inflation in a significant step the 2018 budget released in february recognised that a corporate tax rate of 28 is affecting south africa s global competitiveness the world experiences falling corporate income tax rates in advanced and middle income countries the global trend to reduce corporate income tax rates includes countries that maintain strong investment and trading ties with south africa the united states for example has reduced its rate from 35 to 21 the netherlands from 26 to 21 and the united kingdom from 30 to 19 china s corporate income tax rate is 25 reducing the corporate tax rate would act as a stimulus to the south african economy it should entice businesses to invest in new products new projects and new ventures the longer term benefits will therefore be significant this makes it something that ramaphosa should give serious consideration to as he looks for ways to attract more investment government debt if government expenditure exceeds revenue the difference must be borrowed which adds to the level of government debt this implies that the government s burden on the economy total government debt as percentage of gross domestic product will increase certain economists have commented that sa has entered an unsustainable debt spiral the mtbps expects gross loan debt to increase to 55 8 of gdp in 2018 19 debt is expected to stabilise at 59 6 of gdp in 2023 24 south africa s fiscal position is therefore substantially weaker than it was at the time of the 2008 financial crisis when south africa had a gross debt to gdp ratio that was just above 26 no savings in public sector wage bill treasury admitted in september this year that the contraction of public finances is placing tremendous stress on government and its ability to finance public services and this threatens the affordability of planned expenditure a budget deficit requires government to make tough decisions regarding cost expenditure it does not seem as if the government has the stomach to do this perhaps the biggest concern is the ever growing public sector bill the mtbps states the compensation of public servants accounts for a large and growing proportion of consolidated spending compensation spending was one of the fastest growing items in the budget increasing at an average of 11 2 a year according to the organisation for economic cooperation and development 2017 south africa s government wage bill is one of the highest among developing countries country peers the consolidated wage bill increased rapidly from 32 9 of spending in 2007 8 and remains at about 35 of total expenditure a three year wage public service wage agreement was announced on 8 june 2018 the wage agreement was implemented with effect from 1 april 2018 and covers the period 2018 19 to 2020 21 most public service workers will receive at least 0 5 to 1 above inflation over each of these three periods saa and south african post office receive nearly r8 billion in additional funding state owned enterprises like eskom and saa have been an enormous drain on government resources the roughly 55 debt to gdp ratio masks an additional 15 debt in government guarantees for soes an obligation that the government cannot shy away from the financial recovery of soes is therefore key to getting economic growth and investor confidence back on track the mtbps recognises that several entities with acute financial difficulties do not have sufficient cash to repay debt falling due ordinarily these institutions would refinance these amounts but given negative investor sentiment there is a strong possibility that they will have to redeem this debt
it s been said that talk is cheap but investors seem to not think so when it comes to the ongoing trade negotiations between the united states and china participants in equities markets around the globe appear to be focused on progress between the world s two largest economies in resolving the trade war before a march 1 deadline after u s equities gained ground on tuesday asian and european shares were mostly higher after president trump seemed to suggest he might consider moving back that deadline he said it wasn t a magical date investors were probably cheered by that sentiment given that if the u s and china don t reach a deal by march 1 u s tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports are scheduled to rise from 10 to 25 still it seems that negotiators who were in beijing last week and who are continuing talks this week want to get a deal done before then that s the assumption the market has been making as it has rallied on that optimism the trade war between the u s and china has affected billions of dollars in goods and sparked concerns about corporate and economic growth around the globe airlines stocks in descent one place where concerns about global growth have been reflected is in oil prices amid worries about global demand taking a hit but black gold has been rallying for several days amid the production cut agreed to by opec and other major exporters as well as u s sanctions on iran and venezuela that rally is under pressure this morning however after the u s energy information administration said that u s shale production will rise to a record of about 8 4 million barrels a day in march in news from the airline industry which is heavily exposed to the price of crude this morning southwest airlines co luv shares were down more than 4 after it said the 35 day partial government shutdown affected sales more than it expected the discount airline is now expecting to lose 60 million in revenue in q1 as a result of the closure which it said caused softness in bookings meanwhile luv also took a hit from a downgrade to a sell rating from goldman sachs which warned that luv s new hawaii route may be too costly and further compounding luv s woes was its grappling with a number of grounded planes on tuesday as 180 aircraft were taken out of service for maintenance about twice its normal number one question is whether we ll see additional shutdown related pain in other airlines and a trickle down effect in hotels and rental cars so far several other carriers have already warned that the shutdown will have a negative impact on their sales including united continental holdings ual delta air lines inc dal and american airlines group inc aal all of which were down about 1 in pre market trade fed in focus while that headwind continues the market has seen considerable relief this year on expectations that the federal reserve has hit the brakes on interest rate hikes for the time being new york fed president john williams in an interview with reuters published tuesday reiterated that dovish stance saying he didn t think u s interest rates would need to be raised unless the economy or inflation unexpectedly shifted higher investors are scheduled to get another glimpse into the fed s thinking later today with the release of the minutes from the central bank s last meeting at that meeting the fed stood pat on interest rates amid a more dovish stance on monetary policy that comes as it says inflationary pressures have been muted in addition to looking for more clarity on the fed s outlook for inflation and monetary policy investors may also be trying to discern more about the central bank s thoughts on reducing the bonds it holds on its balance sheet the fed s bond buying program was designed to stabilize the market during the financial crisis and an orderly unwinding of those positions points to increased faith in the strength of the economy but questions remain on the timeline of the selloff and how much the fed unwinds bright spots in retail housing in corporate news that also helped the market tuesday walmart inc wmt reported better than expected earnings a welcome counterpoint for bulls who had been disappointed in recent weak government retail sales data for december the retailing giant s results were helped by e commerce sales growth of more than 40 see more on walmart below with consumer spending making up the single largest contribution to u s gross domestic product any bullish news on that front can help move the market higher recent consumer confidence numbers weren t so hot declining more than expected recent consumer credit data has also appeared to continue to paint a picture of an american consumer that while seemingly not down and out hasn t been showing as much strength as retailers might want yesterday the latest national association of home builders wells fargo housing market index showed that builder confidence in the market for newly built single family homes rose to 62 in february as mortgage rates that have been falling in recent weeks combined with job market strength to held builder sentiment the figure was ahead of a briefing com consensus expectation of 59 other housing market data out this morning from the mortgage bankers association showed that the group s mortgage applications index rose 3 6 last week from the prior week the two reports provide some good news for the housing market which has been a thorn in the side of the u s economy amid affordability issues figure 1 that golden sheen the stock market has calmed down considerably since the selloff late last year yet gold candlestick chart is at its highest point since april since the yellow metal is often considered a haven in times of market distress what gives well gold is also sensitive to the dollar often moving in the opposite direction to the greenback dollar index shown as purple line so as the buck has weakened a bit recently that has helped gold move higher even as stocks also move up data source ice futures us cme group chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade for illustrative purposes only past performance does not guarantee future results checking out online walmart s shares closed more than 2 2 higher yesterday after the retailing giant reported better than expected earnings its profit was driven in part by more than 40 growth in e commerce sales in the general retail industry as brick and mortar sales give way to online clicks it s perhaps no surprise at least in the big scheme of things that online sales are helping walmart but what may be surprising is that according to a yahoo finance article wmt s gargantuan footprint of physical stores throughout the united states is an advantage when competing against amazon com inc amzn which has been ramping up its home delivery of groceries through its prime membership and whole foods ownership as the online e commerce giant makes its foray into the grocery business it has to build more physically sic locations to support the supply chain the article said this is where walmart has an inherent advantage with its more than 4 700 stores in the u s and 90 of americans living within 10 miles of a store global payouts growth in dividends paid out by companies around the globe is expected to slow this year after bumper payouts in 2018 despite a rocky finish to the market s year says janus henderson group jhg global distributions rose 9 3 to hit a record 1 37 trillion last year with thirteen countries delivering record payouts including the united states according to the latest janus henderson global dividend index this year the asset manager expects payouts to rise more modestly at 3 3 to 1 414 trillion more than double what companies distributed ten years ago that forecast may be reassuring to some investors as company outlooks for the year have been tending toward the dismal and worries about global economic growth have ratcheted up it is important for investors to distinguish between slower growth in payouts and dividend cuts according to ben lofthouse head of global equity income with janus henderson investors even when market volatility reflects investor angst dividends tend to follow a steadier trajectory small caps in focus could 2019 be the year of the small cap one thing u s small cap stocks have going for them is that they re typically not as exposed to the reverberations of the u s china trade dispute like large multinational companies are and there are other advantages that small caps have at least as measured by the s p smallcap 600 index says investment research firm cfra according to capital iq consensus estimates 2019 earnings per share growth for spx companies is expected at just 3 1 compared with eps growth expectations of 10 for the s p smallcap 600 index small caps have come back into investor favor and based on relative price performance eps growth projections and discounted

this article was co authored with susan r holmberg and j w mason they are economists and fellows at the roosevelt institute getty almost overnight the idea of a green new deal has won over environmental activists and many lawmakers an all out national mobilization to decarbonize the economy has a natural appeal to those who see climate change as an immediate existential threat but others have doubts why can t markets guide the transition from carbon do we really need an expansion of the public sector on the scale of the new deal or world war ii can we afford it as economists we think the answer is yes to many economists the obvious alternative to a green new deal is a carbon tax make the tax high enough and businesses and consumers will figure the best ways to reduce emissions a group of eminent economists from both parties including nobel laureates and former federal reserve chairman recently endorsed this approach to climate change they argue that markets rather than regulation or public spending are best at spurring investments in clean energy carbon pricing definitely has a role to play but market approaches have limits markets are effective at allocating resources when the required adjustments are small and the outcomes clear and immediate yet there s a reason that during world war ii the government built aircraft factories and allocated scarce materials like steel and rubber through the war production board closer to home there s a reason that large businesses have professional managers to plan their operations and don t rely on internal markets the limits of leaving large scale planning to markets should be even clearer today especially after the experience of the housing bubble and crash which demonstrated a colossal failure of financial markets to direct investment to productive uses we shouldn t count on the same financial system that so mismanaged the housing market to guide the shift away from fossil fuels on its own instead the government needs to mobilize our collective productive capacities through a mix of tools directly through public investments and credit policy through regulations that enforce key climate goals in the same way that harmful chemicals are banned and not just taxed and through taxes and subsidies that ensure that what consumers and businesses pay for goods and services reflects their true social cost perhaps the most common question about the green new deal approach is how do we pay for it that is where will the money come from for new public spending and where will the real resources come from for both public and private investment in decarbonization supporters of the green new deal like most americans also favor higher taxes on very high incomes and wealth but these will not cover all the increased public spending so yes the government will borrow more but this shouldn t worry us in recent years there has been a remarkable shift among economists on the dangers of high public debt the big runup in u s debt over the past decade has not been accompanied by any of the disasters that we used to fear runaway inflation sky high interest rates neither has rising debt in japan which has now reached 250 percent of gdp with no obvious ill effects in a world of low interest rates which seem to be here for the foreseeable future there is no danger of a runaway debt spiral the idea that low interest rates make deficits less worrisome has been forcefully argued by people like former imf chief economist olivier blanchard and former treasury secretary lawrence summers and council of economic advisors chair jason furman even if the government runs deficits year after year the debt will eventually stabilize on the productivity side there is good reason to think that our economy is still operating well below full capacity real gdp today is more than 10 percent below the level predicted a decade ago and at least some of this gap reflects lingering weak demand following the great recession despite the low headline unemployment rate the fraction of working age adults in the labor market is substantially lower than it was a decade ago let alone than in the late 1990s or in many other rich countries meanwhile flat productivity suggests that many of the americans who have jobs are underemployed a truly strong labor market would bring discouraged workers back into the labor force shift currently employed workers into more high yielding work and boost wage growth something that still hasn t happened despite today s supposedly tight labor markets we won t know for sure how much space there is exactly but there s every reason to push the limits if a deficit funded green new deal causes the economy to run hot for a while that s a benefit not a cost faster wage growth will help workers regain the ground they have lost in the last 50 years and if the fed has to raise rates to step on the brakes that gives them more room to cut them again in the next recession there is no silver bullet to address climate change but history shows us that market approaches alone are not enough public investment and other more direct government action are necessary to provide an effective robust response the costs of a green new deal are affordable but the costs of inaction are literally beyond calculation as economists we see a green new deal as eminently reasonable as human beings we see it as a necessity

respectively over 2017 all three of our businesses produced double digit ebit margins this is the first time in owens corning s history that we ve had this margin performance across the entire portfolio and all three businesses generated ebitda margins close to 20 we faced about 240 million of inflation and higher transportation costs we re able to more than cover this with 255 million of price improvement before i talk about our financial results i d like to give you an update on safety our recordable incident rate for 2018 was 0 52 similar to 2017 this is particularly noteworthy given the successful integration of about 4 700 employees from our recent acquisitions also going into 2019 we established a new record for hours worked between injuries over 3 3 million hours compared with our previous record of about 2 6 million hours in 2013 this represents nearly a full month injury free as a company now i d like to briefly review our financials and our views on 2019 michael will follow with more detail in insulation revenue in 2018 grew 2 7 billion up 36 while ebit increased to 290 million up 113 million and 64 in line with our previous expectations revenue growth was generated mainly by our paroc acquisition and 128 million in price improvement primarily in the north american residential fiberglass insulation business in composites we said that we expected ebit to be approximately 260 million for the year we fell slightly short of this goal with ebit of 251 million on lower volumes in several core markets ebit margins for the year were 12 reflecting manufacturing productivity and lower operating expenses in roofing we delivered 2 5 billion of revenue down 2 with ebit margins of 17 roofing performance for the year was negatively impacted by the reduction in the us market for asphalt shingles as growth in the remodeling and new construction markets were more than offset by lower storm demand despite the decline in the market i m pleased to report that roofing delivered significant price gains of 127 million exceeding asphalt and transportation inflation while the business lagged inflation in the early part of the year we were pleased with our inflation recovery in the second half on today s call you will hear that we are taking a bit of a different approach to our forward guidance first you will note that we ve moved this call to 9 00 am so that investors can benefit from our commentary and presentation from this call before the market opens we are hopeful that this approach will enhance our earnings release second we intend to provide less guidance related to full year ebit at the business segment level we will provide an assessment of our expectations for our markets for the year with more emphasis on near term expectations to help investors understand the current business performance all changes are being made in response to investor feedback and our own analysis on how best to support investor communications michael will provide forward guidance in his comments and then he and brian will lead the q a session i m going to end my remarks where i began we transformed this company over the last decade with thoughtful and disciplined actions that have built a strong company with three market leading businesses with an unconditional commitment to safety working every day to demonstrate our caring for our colleagues in insulation we ve built a strong global business with significant through the cycle earnings power in composites we built a business with market leading platforms in glass non wovens and glass reinforcements to capitalize on favorable industry trends and market growth in roofing we ve driven durable commercial and operational performance and built a components business that generates above market growth and supports sustainable earnings over time and as an enterprise we ve made significant and steady progress from the end of the last downturn and have produced four consecutive years of record performance over the last three years revenue grew 10 annually adjusted ebit and adjusted ebitda improved by about 300 million and 440 million respectively which represents growth of about 15 annually for both these key financial metrics adjusted earnings per share grew at a 24 rate over the same period importantly free cash flow conversion exceeded 100 all of these indicators demonstrate the strength of our company in short we re a company with an improved competitive profile and strong earnings potential with that i ll turn it over to michael to further review the details of our performance michael michael c mcmurray senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you mike and good morning everyone in 2018 we set new records for revenue adjusted ebit and adjusted eps for the full year we grew revenue by 11 to over 7 billion and delivered adjusted ebitda of 1 3 billion in 2018 all three businesses returned ebitda margins close to 20 revenue and ebit results finished in line with expectations for the fourth quarter although free cash flow trailed expectations i will comment more on this later in my prepared remarks we delivered strong operational commercial execution in the fourth quarter despite the challenging market conditions we highlighted on the third quarter call during the quarter we continued to make substantial progress on price the actions taken in 2018 have delivered over 250 million of price improvement for the year offsetting inflation and higher transportation cost for the company now let s start on slide 5 which summarizes our key financial data for the fourth quarter you ll find more detailed financial information in the tables of today s news release and the form 10 k today we reported fourth quarter 2018 consolidated net sales of 1 7 billion up 7 and over 100 million compared to sales reported for the same period in 2017 primarily driven by our insulation business adjusted ebit for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 228 million up 6 compared to 215 million in the same period one year ago adjusted ebit for the quarter improved to a record level despite more challenging market conditions and persistent inflation our quarterly adjusted ebit margin of 13 was in line with last year net earnings attributable to owens corning for the fourth quarter were 171 million compared to a 4 million loss in the same period last year adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 were 152 million or 1 38 per diluted share compared to 125 million or 1 11 per diluted share in 2017 depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter was 110 million up 8 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 the year over year incremental depreciation and amortization from our insulation acquisition was partially offset by lower accelerated depreciation associated with the prior year s composite restructuring actions for the year depreciation and amortization expense was 433 million our capital additions for the year were 542 million up 140 million versus last year primarily driven by growth in productivity projects in the fourth quarter we took advantage of downtime to accelerate our 2019 capital program in addition we closed on a small non wovens acquisition that was treated as capex in the fourth quarter as a result capital additions tracked a bit higher versus our previous expectations free cash flow declined just over 400 million and was below our expectations the main drivers of the year over year decrease were higher inventories and higher capital spend higher inventories were driven by inflation the deceleration of demand we experienced in the second half and a purposeful build in synthetic roofing underlayments in advance of potential tariffs although free cash flow was below our expectation conversion exceeded 100 for the last three years on slide 6 you ll see the detail of our full year 2018 adjusting items reconciling our 2018 reported ebit of 821 million to our adjusted ebit of 861 million for the full year our adjusting items totaled 40 million 19 million were primarily related to restructuring charges resulting from actions announced last year to strengthen the composites low delivered cost position and 21 million were acquisition related costs in our insulation business i d like to highlight a couple more items related to adjusted eps we ve adjusted out a 32 million non cash income tax benefit from a fourth quarter tax litigation settlement in europe this was related to the paroc acquisition and represents a significant win also we finalized our accounting for us tax reform legislation that was enacted in 2017 which resulted in a minor update in 2018 ph to our original estimates these adjustments are described in more detail in the notes of our 10 k now please turn to slide 7 where we provide a high level review of our adjusted ebit performance comparing 2018 to 2017 adjusted ebit increased by 6 million insulation ebit increased by 113 million as compared to the prior year composites ebit decreased by 40 million and roofing ebit decreased by 101 million general corporate expenses were 114 million a 34 million improvement versus the prior year primarily due to lower performance based compensation with that review of key financial highlights i ask you to turn to slide 8 where we provide a more detailed review of our business results beginning with our insulation business sales in insulation for the fourth quarter were 732 million up 23 from the same period a year ago primarily on strong price realization and the contribution of the paroc acquisition partially offset by lower sales volumes ebit for the quarter was 115 million up 36 million compared to the same period in 2017 the ebit improvement was driven primarily by strong price execution and the contribution of paroc these benefits were partially offset by persistent materials and transportation inflation and lower sales volumes insulation delivered strong quarterly ebit and ebitda margins of 16 and 22 respectively for the full year insulation sales were 2 7 billion up 36 compared to 2017 on the contribution from our acquisitions and higher selling prices ebit for the full year of 290 million was 113 million higher as compared to 2017 the benefits from higher selling prices and our acquisitions were partially offset by materials and transportation inflation and higher furnace rebuild costs for the full year we delivered ebit and ebitda margins of 11 and 18 respectively although we continued to face challenging market conditions in the fourth quarter commercial execution was strong across the insulation segment with particular strength in our us residential business we delivered significant price progress in 2018 with further price progress in the fourth quarter for the full year we delivered almost 130 million of price improvement including 41 million in the fourth quarter also we implemented an additional pricing action in january in our us residential business earlier this month we celebrated the one year anniversary of our paroc acquisition i m pleased to report that the integration is progressing per plan paroc delivered solid results in the fourth quarter with ebitda margins of 18 in 2019 we expect a flat macro outlook for the north american residential fiberglass insulation business in this business we expect price carryover from 2018 progress from our early 2019 announcement and any additional pricing actions to be offset by the financial impact of lower volumes and production curtailments given this outlook and our expected lower share of the market in the first half we made significant moves to adjust our north american fiberglass insulation capacity to meet the current demand environment most notably we recently took the decision to take one of our production lines in santa clara california cold in the first quarter the actions we have taken in regards to capacity reductions have been decisive and are consistent with running this business for long term profitability the financial impact of the curtailments will be particularly heavy in the first quarter in the technical and other building insulation businesses we expect revenue and earnings growth driven by improved operating performance and global growth in construction and industrial insulation markets we expect improved operational performance in our us business and strong organic growth in europe with the start up of our new mineral wool facility in poland we also expect to get good organic growth across the globe in most products in the near term our progress in our technical and other building insulation businesses will not overcome the financial impact of lower volumes and curtailment actions in our north american residential fiberglass insulation business as a result we expect first quarter 2019 ebit in insulation to be positive but significantly lag last year now i ll ask you to turn your attention to slide 9 for a review of our composites business sales in composites for the fourth quarter were 481 million down 5 compared to the same period in 2017 the decrease was driven by negative foreign currency translation and slightly lower sales volumes ebit for the quarter was 56 million down compared to 74 million in the same period last year the decrease was primarily driven by higher inflation and to a lesser extent lower sales volumes full year sales were 2 0 billion down 1 compared to the same period in 2017 on lower sales volumes and stable pricing sales volumes were down 2 as broad overall market growth was offset by weakness in a few core markets particularly the us roofing market the business delivered full year ebit of 251 million which was down 40 million from the prior year as higher inflation higher rebuild and start up cost and lower sales volumes more than offset improved manufacturing and lower operating expenses composites maintained double digit margins for the full year delivering ebit and ebitda margins of 12 and 20 respectively from a cost perspective we expect that our recently completed low cost india facility expansion strategic supply alliances in asia and our previously announced high cost melter restructuring actions will drive manufacturing productivity and improve our cost position in 2019 and beyond in 2019 we expect growth in the glass fiber market consistent with global industrial production growth with a more uncertain global economic environment we expect volume growth in line with the broader market and improved operating performance will be offset by inflation ph one additional item of note in composites we are seeing good volumes at the start of 2019 but we expect first quarter 2019 ebit will lag last year primarily due to continued inflationary pressures and a planned furnace rebuild in south korea slide 10 provides an overview of our roofing business roofing sales for the quarter were 546 million down 3 compared with the same period a year ago lower sales volumes partially offset by higher selling prices primarily drove the decline in the fourth quarter our sales volumes trailed market shipments which we believe was primarily as a result of distributor year end buying activity with other manufacturers we believe this late season activity was driven by the desire to achieve rebate gains ph and is not totally reflective of underlying end market demand sales for the full year were 2 5 billion a 2 decrease versus the prior year the us asphalt shingle market declined by 5 as growth in remodeling and new construction markets was more than offset by lower storm demand higher selling prices partially offset the lower sales volumes full year ebit was 434 million a 101 million decrease from the prior year primarily due to lower sales volumes for the full year roofing delivered pricing improvements that exceeded asphalt and transportation inflation our contribution margin dollars per unit consistently improved since the beginning of 2018 ph as we successfully implemented multiple pricing actions despite a weaker demand environment for the full year roofing delivered strong ebit and ebitda margins of 17 and 19 respectively contribution margins entering 2019 are healthy despite asphalt and transportation inflation that was persistent for much of 2018 asphalt prices moderated at the end of 2018 but moved higher in february despite the weakness in the price of oil in addition we are anticipating further asphalt inflation in the first half as a result we ve announced a price increase that will be effective in april the roofing business is positioned to deliver another strong year in 2019 we expect relatively flat us asphalt shingle end market demand with industry shipments slightly below last year assuming average storm demand we expect an above market volume opportunity for owens corning resulting from favorable geographic mix and a higher share of industry shipments in 2019 i wanted to highlight the expectations for first quarter volumes if you recall last year there was significant storm volume carryover into the first quarter and an outlook for a significant asphalt and transportation inflation in addition manufacturers had announced multiple price actions during the first quarter of the year the market environment is different this year and as a result we anticipate our volumes will track lower than last year now let me turn your attention to slide 11 which provides an overview of significant financial matters we repurchased 2 9 million shares of the company s stock in 2018 leaving 4 6 million shares available for repurchase as of the end of 2018 under our current authorization during 2018 we returned 203 million of cash directly to shareholders through share repurchases and 92 million through dividends the company s board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0 22 per share payable on april 2nd 2019 to shareholders of record as of march 8th 2019 the dividend has grown an average of 7 per year since its inception now please turn to slide 12 where i provide more context on our business outlook for 2019 for 2019 the company expects an environment consistent with consensus expectations for global industrial production growth us housing starts and global commercial and industrial construction growth in insulation the company expects a flat macro outlook for the north american residential fiberglass insulation business with positive pricing momentum offset by lower volumes and production curtailments in the technical and other building insulation businesses the company expects earnings growth driven by improved operating performance and growth in global construction and industrial insulation markets in composites the company expects growth in glass fiber markets consistent with global industrial production growth with a more uncertain global economic environment the company expects volume growth and improved operating performance to be offset by inflation in roofing the company expects relatively flat end market demand with industry shipments slightly below last year assuming average storm demand for owens corning the company anticipates a favorable geographic mix comparison and a higher share of industry shipments in 2019 contribution margins entering 2019 position the business for continued strong performance now please turn to slide 13 where i provide more guidance on other financial items for the year as discussed in previous earning calls improved earnings better working capital performance and our advantaged tax position has translated into a strong conversion ratio of adjusted earnings to free cash flow over the past four years in 2018 our results trailed ph our expectations looking forward we have confidence in returning to another year of strong free cash flow generation in 2019 at this time the company plans to prioritize free cash flow to ongoing dividends and making progress in paying down our term loan additional free cash flow could be available for share repurchases under the company s current authorization we expect corporate expenses of 140 million to 150 million with the year over year growth primarily due to the reset of performance based compensations capital additions are expected to total approximately 500 million and includes capital for the completion of paroc s capacity in poland the relocation of our shanghai insulation plant and investments in productivity depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be about 460 million interest expense is expected to be about 130 million as a result of our tax nol foreign tax credits and other planning initiatives we expect our 2019 cash tax rate to be 10 to 12 of adjusted pre tax earnings our 2019 effective tax rate is expected to be 26 to 28 of adjusted pre tax earnings with that i ll turn the call over to thierry to lead us in the question and answer session thierry thierry denis vice president of investor relations thank you michael and we are now ready to begin the q a session questions and answers operator thank you we will now being the question and answer session operator instructions the first question today comes from stephen kim with evercore isi please go ahead stephen kim evercore isi analyst yeah thanks very much guys i guess my first question relates to your comments about the santa clara line going cold or moving to cold in 1q i was wondering if you could give us a little bit more background around that and also dimensionalize what the costs might look like so for example what does this plant make how permanent is this curtailment if you could give us a sense for what those costs associated with that curtailment we can expect will be and if you eventually start this thing up will there be associated start up costs as well on the other side brain chambers president and chief operating officer okay good morning stephen this is brian thanks for that question a lot to unpack there so let me kind of set the stage a little bit when we talk about our first quarter performance and around the curtailment we have our technical insulation business we have our res insulation business this is all around our res insulation business and really tied to volumes and the outlook we see there so we continue to operate our residential insulation business believing that we re not at the top of the roofing cycle or of the i m sorry the housing cycle and but we do expect we re going to see some less volume coming through in the first part of the year primarily due to some softness we re seeing in the overall housing market that s translating through to a demand for our products we also are maintaining our price position and strategy and we believe that that s going to cost us little bit of discretionary share here in the first part of the year and then we are facing some tough comps versus prior year where another manufacturer had some production issues and we picked up some discretionary volume last year that we re not seeing flow through this year so on a year over year basis when we look at our volume outlook through the first part of the year we ve decided to take some proactive steps to curtail some production across our manufacturing lines and then remove some high cost capacity with the facility and with the line in santa clara so we think that curtailments impacts we re taking if i had to dimensionalize the impact there i think we said in the past that an average line is about 2 of industry capacity so i think that should give you a characterization of kind of the capacity that the santa clara line would represent and overall we think curtailment that would represent about a third of our total curtailments we re planning for the business in that space so i think in terms of the length of time in that clearly we ve seen a reduction in the housing market outlook we ve seen estimates come down to a pretty flat year this year and into next year so i think we want to we re optimistic that we could see some housing growth through the year in 19 and into 20 but we want to be realistic in terms of rightsizing our business to make sure that we re delivering on our working capital our cash flow goals in the space so these are actions that we believe are right for us given where we re at in the cycle they are going to have an impact to our 2019 earnings especially in the first quarter but certainly gives us maximum flexibility to respond to the different demand scenarios as they progress this year and into 2020 so operator the next question comes from matthew bouley with barclays please go ahead matthew bouley barclays bank plc analyst hi good morning thank you for taking the questions and i just want to extend my congratulations to mike on his retirement so i guess just following up on that point with insulation specifically so when you mentioned that a lot of these puts and takes in insulation effectively offset this year and please clarify that if that s not correct but in that comment are you assuming future price increases in insulation and really more broadly how are you thinking about future price increases to the extent that they can be realized in 2019 given everything you re saying about the new residential environment thank you brain chambers president and chief operating officer sure thanks for the question yes i mean i think we demonstrated some great success in 2018 around capturing price in the insulation business overall particularly in our res business so we ve got some carryover pricing that s coming into the year we announced our january increase that we are implementing in the space so while we expect to capture some additional price from these actions certainly these increases we think are going to offset the curtailment costs and some of the lower volumes out there we continue to believe in our pricing strategy which is that price is critical to us returning this business to historical profitability levels so we re going to look and see how the year plays out but again we don t believe we re at the top of the cycle and at this point as housing starts progress if we see the growth that is forecast in the back half of the year we think that we get the option of in terms of maintaining price that we have in place and capturing some incremental volume coming back so we think it sets us up well given the variability in the market outlook operator the next question comes from susan maklari with credit suisse please go ahead christopher kalata credit suisse analyst hi this is actually chris on for susan thanks for taking our questions just want to drill in a little deeper into the insulation pricing could you just give us some color on what you ve seen so far in your january price increases and as well as how do you expect industry participants to react to the reduced capacity at santa clara now michael c mcmurray senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah thanks for the question chris so i think i d characterize the environment certainly we saw a softness in demand coming through in the fourth quarter that we ve seen continue kind of into the first part of the year and we think there s a bit of an air pocket that s been created by housing starts coming down when we look at the impact interest rates had on the back half of the year i think we believe that had some impact on that but going forward when you look at the overall macro economy we believe that with household formations with employment growth pricing income growth we think it s a constructive market to see growth in new construction so we want to make sure we re positioning the business to take advantage of that as that comes back to us but certainly we re in an air pocket now that s created a little bit of slack in demand and that s put some pressure on pricing in the near term but again back to our pricing strategy business has been we think it s a key part to return the business to profitability we think holding price at this point certainly gives us the best option to get both price and volume in the second half if ph the new construction market strengthens operator next question comes from michael eisen with rbc capital markets michael eisen rbc capital markets analyst good morning thank you guys for taking the questions wanted to transition to the roofing segment and talk about the price cost dynamics that are at play you talked about an april price increase and the ability to overcome some of the inflation you saw in 18 so thinking out to next year how should we technical difficulty michael h thaman chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah you kind of broke up a little bit i think your question i ll take i think the question more around the outlook on pricing and how we see that playing out in 2019 and margins and performance in our roofing business clearly i think we ve got a great track record in our roofing business to be able to offset asphalt inflation with price i think we demonstrated that through 2018 where even in a weaker volume environment and a lot of inflation coming through to us in terms of asphalt and transportation we were able to get pricing into the market to recover that as michael said in his comments we finished the year with very strong cash contribution margins in the business so i think it demonstrated the value of our product and certainly demonstrated our ability to go get price when we faced inflationary pressures in our roofing business so as we spin that forward into 2019 we ve announced a price increase as we are expecting some continued asphalt and transportation inflation in the business albeit at a more kind of moderate pace than last year but we think where we finished the year in cash contribution margins we were in a we re in a very good position so our pricing philosophy is to go out and recover that upcoming asphalt and transportation inflation to keep those contribution margins strong so i think that gives us a good base from a market volume outlook we believe we re in an environment where if we get some just average storm demand we think we re going to have another constructive demand year in the market so that should give us some opportunity to get a little bit of volume growth as we talked about earlier in the prepared comments with strong margin so we do see a path where we can continue to generate revenue growth and good earnings in our roofing business in 2019 operator the next question comes from john lovallo with bank of america please go ahead john lovallo bank of america analyst hey guys thank you for taking my question i guess in terms of the composites you were talking about volume and improved operating performance offset by inflation how should we think about pricing in that business in 2019 michael c mcmurray senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning so here is what i d say to kind of think about pricing for the composites business this year i mean i think first and foremost i d let you know that overall utilization rates remain quite high so that s a good thing also based on kind of current expectations from a macro perspective we re going to we expect to see decent global growth although there is heightened uncertainty so overall we re probably expecting another year of price stability as you know the current performance of our business from a financial perspective is pretty strong we do a fair amount of competitor analysis as well and we think that the industry leaders are earning strong financial returns as well probably return on capital before tax in the mid teens so we probably don t expect any meaningful price in the near term now we do have a desire to offset inflation with price and so that s no doubt a desire if you look at the long term history for owens corning that hasn t been the fact and actually as a company we ve driven a fair amount of productivity and cost takeout over the last couple of decades to offset inflation as we look at 2019 specifically and look forward we ve gotten a lot done over the last couple of years around our subscale melter restructuring also our low cost india expansion which came online last year and then the strategic supply alliances that we put in place in asia pacific so kind of thinking about thinking about this year again expecting decent global growth although heightened uncertainty we re confident that we re going to improve our operating performance and putting those two together we think that that should largely offset inflation kind of based on kind of current consensus estimates for global industrial production growth now what i would tell you from a longer term perspective two of the larger chinese participants ctg and jushi their parent companies merged and they ve a stated expectation that they re going to merge the glass companies at some point in time date to be determined operator your next question comes from truman patterson with wells fargo please go ahead truman patterson wells fargo analyst hey good morning guys just wanted to touch on your roofing segment it looks like you had a lot of pricing in the fourth quarter it more than offset the asphalt and transportation cost but it seemed like the other inflationary pressures really hit your margins even accounting for some of the loss leverage i guess how should we really think about this other inflationary pressure throughout 2019 and will this continue to kind of eat into margins michael h thaman chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah thanks truman just to kind of characterize a little bit the margin performance in q4 and then i ll talk about some of the other inflation drivers i think when you look through the performance in the fourth quarter this is really primarily a volume issue in the fourth quarter in terms of impacting margins on a year over year basis we just lost a fair amount of operating leverage across our manufacturing facilities in recovering our opex leverage so price was offsetting inflation which is what we expected but we just lost a lot of leverage on the operations side carrying in but i think how to think about that as we go into this year we believe pricing will offset inflation our cash contribution margins are strong i think part of the other impact there a little bit is when you look at the inflation recovery it s kind of a dollar for dollar so we got prices up but 1 price kind of cover a 1 of inflation so while our cash contribution margins have stayed strong at historic levels i think we ve lost a little bit of ebit margin leverage with just that translation between price and inflation so as we come into this year we feel our contribution margins are good we think that the pricing action we ve announced would allow us to stay on top of asphalt and transportation and some of that other inflation that we see coming through we also have a pretty robust productivity program inside all of our businesses to help offset that other material inflation so we feel the margin performance of the business is good and will stay strong in 2019 operator the next question comes from keith hughes with suntrust please go ahead keith hughes suntrust analyst thank you my question is in insulation your comments about 2019 of ebit i believe being positive but being i assume the comment is down pretty substantially in the year is that about residential insulation or about the segment as a whole brain chambers president and chief operating officer thanks keith this is brian so again going back to our insulation business we really have our res business and then our technical insulation and other building materials business so when we re talking about kind of the earnings outlook primarily when we look at our res business i think we ve talked about where we re seeing some positive price momentum but that s really going to be offsetting what we believe to be our curtailment costs and some lower volumes as the year plays out where we re expecting some continued revenue growth really is inside our technical insulation business and this has been a core part of our strategy as we ve looked to really invest to grow this part of the insulation business it gives us access to some new markets different product applications it s a segment or it s a business that s much less price sensitive to some of the volume changes and we feel like that the investments we ve made there are going to generate growth in terms of revenue and earnings moving forward so and we re pretty excited i think our paroc and our foamglas business integrations have gone very very well those businesses are delivering financial performance in line with our expectations we are going to be completing out our paroc investment as michael talked about that gives us additional stone wool capacity in europe we re seeing some positive regulation changes that we think are going to open up additional opportunity for stone wool into building applications there which gives us a growth avenue in north america we re continuing to see growth in our north american mineral wool business in new applications our glass pipe and mechanical businesses so really inside of our technical building insulation business we do expect to see positive growth going forward in 2019 so i think it s really a combination of in our res business we think we re going to be a little challenged based on the volume outlook and housing starts outlook but in our technical insulation business we feel like we ve got good revenue and earnings growth in sight for us in 2019 operator the next question comes from garik shmois with longbow research please go ahead garik shmois longbow research analyst thank you just wanted to ask about roofing can you talk about what you re seeing on core roofing demand excluding storms and it also sounds like there were some channel fill in the fourth quarter on the part of competitors so just wondering if you can speak to inventory levels and how that might impact the ability to get price to offset inflation this year michael h thaman chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes thanks garik so just let me talk a little bit on fourth quarter maybe put some context around that i think we came into the quarter thinking that we were going to see a drop in volumes in the third quarter we saw manufacturing shipments down about 20 and we thought that that could continue into the fourth quarter in fact we saw a little bit of storm demand particularly in colorado carolinas but then as you say a pretty significant impact that we think some distributors that brought in some inventory tied to some incentive gate so we don t think this is any kind of widespread change in behavior but certainly that impacted some of the fourth quarter volumes with inventory coming in that we would normally i think expect to see in 2019 so when i look at that impact as it carries into 2019 if i step back and just look at broad demand drivers we continue to see the reroof remodeling business pretty strong we ve got good contractor visibility and we think that there s good backlog and optimism that there s going to be continued growth there in 2019 i think new construction demand could be a little flat given our outlook on housing starts but i think still when you look at the overall market opportunity assuming a pretty average storm we think we re going to be in a very constructive market environment we think there is opportunities for growth in our business relative to outperforming a little bit of the manufacturing shipments because we weren t shipping into the fourth quarter similar to a few other manufacturers and then in 2018 we had some geographic headwinds a lot of demand up on the east coast that we think that balances out for us so we think inside an average kind of storm year we would expect to see end market demand pretty flat manufacturing shipments might trail a little bit because of the inventory pull through but our volume outlook would be pretty strong and we d see some opportunities for a little bit of growth relative to the opportunity in the market operator the next question comes from justin speer with zelman associates please go ahead justin speer zelman associates analyst thank you i just wanted to unpack if you could i know you ve mentioned it earlier but the free cash conversion in the year particularly relative to what you were thinking even a couple of quarters ago was disappointing so i was wondering if you can unpack that for us and then talk to what you think you re going to be able to achieve in 2019 michael c mcmurray senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you justin a couple of things so let me kind of set it up and then i ll take you through kind of what transpired throughout the year but you know i think first and foremost if you look back over the last four years the free cash flow performance for the company has actually been a big bright spot and then the improvements that we ve made in working capital had been very very significant in the years 15 16 and 17 talking specifically about our 2018 results you would have heard us on the third quarter call highlight that we were going to track below kind of our 100 conversion goal for the year actual results actually tracked lower than that again kind of thinking about it year on year primarily working capital related and then some higher capex about half each now if you think about the goal that we laid out some years ago around generating average conversion of a 100 over a three year period looking specifically to last year we were probably about 200 million of free cash flow better than that goal and then looking specifically at this year or 18 we were about 300 million worse than our goal specifically looking at 2017 we hung up a fair amount of payables on the balance sheet related to capex and so that was a tailwind for 17 and a headwind for 18 to the tune of about 60 million still if you look over the last three years or you look over the last four years we ve generated free cash flow conversion slightly in excess of 100 now for the year 2019 we expect another strong year of cash flow and free cash flow conversion now thinking about some of the headwinds that we faced in 18 to talk maybe give you a little bit more color around working capital specifically the primary driver was related to inventories the biggest build in that space would have been within our roofing business and really in two key areas half of it would have been roughly related to asphalt inflation and then the other half would have been related to purposeful or conscious build of coated wovens inventory here in the us that s coming from china and we were getting that inventory here on the ground in advance of potential tariffs and then lastly due to the kind of underlying market slowing down late q3 and into q4 we did see some inventory build in our two businesses that melt glass those assets are hard to turn on a dime and then within composites specifically we had a bit of a purposeful build related to some of the asset moves that we ve made around small melters and the new asset that we were building or bringing up in india so again looking to 19 so i think we have confidence that we re going to return to another year of strong free cash flow generation clearly we re not going to face the same headwinds that we did in 2018 and i think that working capital inventories in particular are going to be a source of free cash flow you heard us talk in our prepared remarks you heard us talk in q a that we re taking some pretty significant curtailment actions in our insulation business justin speer zelman associates analyst one more question operator the next question comes from michael wood with nomura instinet mason marion nomura instinet analyst hi this is mason marion on for mike in composites what are your rebuilding expense assumptions in 2019 relative to 2018 and then any update on trends within the indian wind market thank you michael h thaman chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah from a rebuild perspective i ll help you out thinking about it this way so last year essentially we had two rebuilds this year we re expected to have two rebuilds the difference last year is that we re also bringing up our new facility in india so that would have been a little bit of a headwind so when you think about kind of manufacturing costs year on year that should be a bit of a tailwind and then regards to the india wind market while it was a disappointment most of last year and came back slower than what we had anticipated we made progress in the third quarter of last year we ve made progress in the fourth quarter of last year and we re anticipating progress this year as well so momentum is building it s headed in the right direction operator the next question comes from michael rehaut with jpmorgan please go ahead elad hillman jpmorgan analyst hi this is elad on for mike i just wanted to dig in a little bit deeper on the roofing volumes at the in 4q and then going forward was there something in particular driving the year end rebates from other manufacturers or is this something that you ve seen in the past and then what have you seen so far this year with distributor buying trends and how much of an impact from the inventory pull through do you expect thanks brain chambers president and chief operating officer thanks for the questions this is brian you know volume incentives are not uncommon practices inside the roofing business i think so that s not unusual to kind of see some of those incentive structures put in place for distributors i think it s a little unusual to see what we believe is pretty significant inventory buy in as a result of that and again i think that was a combination of these incentives being set at the beginning of the year against specific volume gates and as the year progressed it was a little slower than the prior year and so i think that caused some distributors to make an economic decision to weigh ph bringing in inventory against an incentive or kind of letting it go and pushing it into 2019 and clearly there was enough of incentive for some distributors to want to do that but again i think it was a handful that participated and certainly not widespread in that space so i think as we roll that into our outlook for 2019 again overall i don t think that any of those moves impacted out the door sales or our contractor share positions in the market i just think it pulled forward some of the manufacturing shipment demand that we ll see in 2019 so in 2019 we expect end markets to stay pretty strong but manufacturing shipments to trail on a full year basis as a result of this i think as i as i think about how that s going to play out in q1 i do think that inventory pull will have an impact on q1 purchases so i think as we look at the shape of the year versus last year we re expecting a little softer q1 where we would see significantly less storm demand on a year over year basis again 17 was pretty strong in a storm year and we had a fair amount of carryover into the first quarter of 18 we re not seeing that kind of carryover we think there is going to be some impact on some of this pre buy activity for some of the distributors and also i think the third component that s going to shape the year a little differently is you know last year we were in a very high inflationary environment we had a couple of spring increases announced so that gave distributors a lot of incentive to buy earlier in the year ahead of the season much more than this year so we think this year we re going to see some more volume drift into the second quarter just as normal kind of buying pattern out of distributors that they buy ahead of the season on that space so i think that s going to shape the first quarter and first half a little differently in terms of distributor buying ph but i think again on a full year basis in end market we think it s still going to be pretty strong for us operator next question comes from scott schrier with citi please go ahead scott schrier citi analyst hi good morning i just wanted to ask you about insulation taking into account all the comments that you made yes we re going to have a weaker 1q which is seasonably light anyway you re making the curtailments with a little volume environment and with good pricing how should we think about your incremental margins maybe with respect to some of the numbers you ve communicated in the past as being a mid cycle average and then more broadly speaking long term do you still think after some of these actions that that s still the correct way to think about the business from an incremental margin perspective brain chambers president and chief operating officer yeah let me frame it a little bit maybe i ll ask mike to jump in on some of the historical piece i mean i think that the outlook in terms of volumes that we see growing through the year we do expect we re going to need a little bit of positive market momentum to maintain our volume space and allows us to then look at additional pricing but i think overall the margin carry that we have today is solid but we re not at historical levels so we continue to want to push the performance of the res side of the business up even further so i guess mike maybe i ll ask you to make a few comments on that historic point michael c mcmurray senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah thanks brian i d be happy to try to add something there scott i think it s a good question i mean we talked about the business historically as being an operating leverage story and i think during the period of time where we began that narrative probably in the 2013 2014 time frame it really was a res improvement story i mean res at that time was losing money we had visibility to improved housing starts that are going to drive our utilization give us a leverage in our economics give us a leverage maybe to get a little bit better pricing environment so those two things combined caused us to see the top line and bottom line in insulation was going to be largely driven by a significant improvement in res in the environment we re in today we ve obviously dramatically built out the technical insulation side of the business we ve diversified the business to europe we ve diversified the business across multiple technologies on the technical side that s a much more stable pricing environment which is in today s environment not giving us a tremendous amount of leverage but it is a very good news in a downturn we like those businesses because they tend to be much more stable in the ups and much more stable in the down so i think with the mix of business today it s probably hard to see an overall operating leverage story for the entire insulation business that would be at the kind of levels we had talked about previously now for res i think we would still think that s a business that can produce that kind of leverage specifically to 2019 we re talking about a year where there is an offset price on the positive volume and curtailment on the negative those offsetting as we go through the year depending on how the second half comes out so i don t think res is today a big part of the story of how we would see improvement in insulation in 2019 but i do think as we look through the cycle we d continue to expect with some volume growth back in res that we d get back to operating leverage on the res side of the ledger thierry denis vice president of investor relations yeah anita it s thierry it looks like we re probably at the end of the q a session right anita operator we have the next question comes from ken zener with keybanc kenneth zener keybanc analyst good morning gentlemen hello operator and do you have a question thierry denis vice president of investor relations ken we can hear you kenneth zener keybanc analyst okay i couldn t hear you sorry about that thierry last question yet again appreciate that color and the new approach gentlemen for insulation the i understand the annual comments that you gave i think it s good that you re talking about the first quarter pressure my single question is can you talk about the first half expectations for housing activity versus your expectations for the second half so if consensus is flat i m just trying to see how much downside you re seeing in the first half versus a potential recovery in the second half thank you very much brain chambers president and chief operating officer yeah thanks ken i mean look we think right now if we look at expectations for housing starts it s kind of a mirror effect to what we saw in 18 so we think that that decline was in the back half of last year sloping down and we believe this year we would start to see progression and positive movement of the housing starts as we move into q2 and through the rest of the year so that s the progression of housing starts from a market opportunity that we re planning for that s the biggest uncertainty around our res is going to be a little bit of that macro timing on when those housing starts actually materialize and when that then flows through to demand for us so that s something that we re not expecting a lot of volume growth in the first half of this year as a result of that and we think that carries through and creates a stronger second half for us if that materializes thierry denis vice president of investor relations thank you brian and i think this concludes the q a session and with that i d like to thank everybody for joining today s call and i d like to hand it over back to mike for some closing comments michael h thaman chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you thierry to summarize 2018 was
