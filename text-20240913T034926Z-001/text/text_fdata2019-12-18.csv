let us remember that when macri started his mandate in december 2015 he accepted all the injunctions formulated by a new york magistrate who had ruled in the favor of vulture funds vulture funds vulture fund investment funds who buy on the secondary markets and at a significant discount bonds once emitted by countries that are having repayment difficulties from investors who prefer to cut their losses and take what price they can get in order to unload the risk from their books the vulture funds then pursue the issuing country for the full amount of the debt they have purchased not hesitating to seek decisions before usually british or us courts where the law is favourable to creditors against argentina this has made it possible for those investment funds investment fund investment funds private equity investment funds sometimes called mutual funds seek to invest in companies according to certain criteria of which they most often are specialized capital risk capital development funds leveraged buy out lbo which reflect the different levels of the company s maturity specializing in repurchasing sovereign securities at cut prices to garner 4 6 billion a 300 profit profit the positive gain yielded from a company s activity net profit is profit after tax distributable profit is the part of the net profit which can be distributed to the shareholders to compensate these vulture funds mauricio macri borrowed on the financial markets he claimed that everything would be fine since implementing neoliberal policies would make argentina more attractive to foreign investors and lenders international mainstream media supported him when invited to comment experts in economics presented macri s argentina as a success story issuing in 2017 bonds that would come to maturity one hundred years later 2117 was hailed as the ultimate proof of macri s pro market neoliberal success in early june 2017 bankers could borrow at 0 from the ecb the bank of japan and the swiss national bank at 0 25 from the bank of england and at 1 00 from the federal reserve in the us while investment funds had huge amounts of cash and return on public debt securities in the north was very low or even negative argentine bonds at 7 25 over one hundred years was a godsend in fact the success of those bonds had a completely different explanation the interest interest an amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set rate every year for one hundred years is 7 25 with an actual return on the initial purchase price of 7 917 for the bonds were sold at a cut price to attract investors at the same time in early june 2017 bankers could borrow at 0 from the ecb ecb european central bank the european central bank is a european institution based in frankfurt founded in 1998 to which the countries of the eurozone have transferred their monetary powers its official role is to ensure price stability by combating inflation within that zone its three decision making organs the executive board the governing council and the general council are composed of governors of the central banks of the member states and or recognized specialists according to its statutes it is politically independent but it is directly influenced by the world of finance the bank of japan and the swiss national bank at 0 25 from the bank of england and at 1 00 from the federal reserve fed federal reserve officially federal reserve system is the united states central bank created in 1913 by the federal reserve act also called the owen glass act after a series of banking crises particularly the bank panic of 1907 fed decentralized central bank in the us while investment funds had huge amounts of cash and return on public debt securities in the north was very low or even negative argentine bonds at 7 25 over one hundred years was a godsend their success was thus in no way evidence of the argentine economy s good health there is such a huge amount of capital intended for speculation and not for productive investment that any state that issues sovereign securities with a return that is higher than average is likely to find takers here is an example of comments to be found in the press heralding the 100 year bonds argentina sold 2 75 billion of a hotly demanded 100 year bond bond a bond is a stake in a debt issued by a company or governmental body the holder of the bond the creditor is entitled to interest and reimbursement of the principal if the company is listed the holder can also sell the bond on a stock exchange in u s dollars on monday just over a year after emerging from its latest default according to the government the south american country received 9 75 billion in orders for the bond as investors eyed a yield yield the income return on an investment this refers to the interest or dividends received from a security and is usually expressed annually as a percentage based on the investment s cost its current market value or its face value of 7 9 percent in an otherwise low yielding fixed income market where pension funds pension fund pension funds pension funds investment funds that manage capitalized retirement schemes they are funded by the employees of one or several companies paying into the scheme which often is also partially funded by the employers the objective is to pay the pensions of the employees that take part in the scheme they manage very big amounts of money that are usually invested on the stock markets or financial markets need to lock in long term returns this reuters report clearly celebrates the country s achievement one year earlier in april 2016 reuters reported marking a rare bright spot among gloomy emerging markets argentina sold 16 5 billion of sovereign debt sovereign debt government debts or debts guaranteed by the government on tuesday in its first international bond issue since its record 2002 default investors seemed convinced of strategy argentina received offers worth 68 6 billion from investors around the world anybody will understand from such hyperbolic comments that major capitalist corporations all over the world were on the lookout for opportunities to obtain high yield by purchasing high risk securities it does not tell anything about argentina s economic health potential lenders such as investment funds or major banks thought that argentine securities would be guaranteed by the state of argentina and that if necessary they could seek favorable adjudication in the jurisdiction of new york they were right since the loan agreements were made in accordance with the law of the state of new york anyway they were also convinced that in case of necessity the imf imf international monetary fund along with the world bank the imf was founded on the day the bretton woods agreements were signed its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates when the bretton wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the imf became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital it acts as policeman when it enforces its structural adjustment policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments as for the world bank a weighted voting system operates depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state 85 of the votes is required to modify the imf charter which means that the usa with 17 68 of the votes has a de facto veto on any change the institution is dominated by five countries the united states 16 74 japan 6 23 germany 5 81 france 4 29 and the uk 4 29 the other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country the most important one 6 57 of the votes is led by belgium the least important group of countries 1 55 of the votes is led by gabon and brings together african countries would bail out the government of argentina so that it may repay its debt to private funds as it had always done another argument was the following argentina s underground resources are significant and if hard pressed argentina could increase production in order to meet lenders expectations in short in 2016 2017 while argentina s real economy was collapsing the government managed to find lenders and its right wing government was praised in international media as well as by the imf and by other governments in the hold of big capital while argentina s real economy was collapsing the government managed to find lenders and its right wing government was praised in international media as well as by the imf and by other governments in the hold of big capital but the situation took a turn for the worse in 2018 as a consequence of several negative factors resulting from macri s policies such as a steep rise in the amount of interests to be paid which had to be financed by ever new loans massive flight of capital that was made possible by a most lax policy of complete freedom for capital to leave the country it showed that argentine capitalists had limited confidence in macri s future and preferred shopping elsewhere including buying argentine external debt securities in us dollars on wall street currency reserves sharply dropped production started to decline and argentina slipped into recession employment plummeted most people s purchasing power dropped as a consequence of the government s and bosses attacks as a result domestic consumption that accounted for 70 of argentina s gdp gdp gross domestic product gross domestic product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added the measure is notoriously incomplete for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange the gdp takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services economic growth is defined as the variation of the gdp from one period to another also dropped the argentine peso gradually sunk while 22 pesos bought one euro on 1st january 2018 32 pesos were needed on 16 june 2018 in this context in june 2018 macri called on the imf as foreign investors and argentine capitalists had anticipated the total credit promised by the imf rose to 57 billion with 44 1 billion actually paid up to now as a first step in june 2018 the amount of 50 billion had been announced and a few months later as the situation had not improved 7 more billion were added this is the highest ever loan granted by the imf the imf s loan to greece in 2010 was 30 billion as usual the imf demanded even stricter austerity policies that were even more unpopular than those already introduced by macri christine lagarde mauricio macri cc argentina indymedia org in october 2019 the argentine people turned away from macri and elected the peron political movement back into office after an intermission of four years alberto fernandez became president and cristina fernandez who was president from 2007 to 2015 vice president alberto and cristina are not related the cadtm s latin american and caribbean network cadtm ayna held its 8th annual assembly in preparation of alberto fernandez succeeding mauricio macri as president 10 december 2019 i participated in the meeting as well as in several talks and debates including one at the parliament of argentina i also gave four interviews fifteen minutes live on a popular private and anti macri tv channel a video for an information website connected with the main civil service trade union canal abierto one on the main website of the revolutionary left laizquierdadiario the daily paper of the left which has an average of two million visits per month and one to the main center left newspaper pagina 12 the rate of poverty strongly increased over the four years of macri s mandate going from 27 to 40 of the population the rate of poverty strongly increased over the four years of macri s mandate going from 27 to 40 of the population in the days before macri left the presidency to the two fernandezs debt repayment was the most debated issue on the other hand we should emphasize that social and political movements in argentina are massive and well organized trade unions are still powerful the feminist movement is still able to mobilize on a large scale the unemployed too are well organized the cooperative movement is strong the various neoliberal experiments that started with the dictatorship 1976 1983 and that had their latest attempt under macri have not been able to fracture the argentine society and contrary to what is the case in neighboring chile education is free including at university level as indeed is health care the questions most often raised in argentine media during the november december 2019 period while the previous government had suspended repayment of part of the internal debt will the new government repay the accumulated debt and implement policies that have been rejected by a majority of the people what should be done with the imf agreements since the imf is expected to pay argentina 11 to 13 billion must the new government demand those payments or withdraw from them shouldn t argentina suspend debt repayment for two years so as to make sure that economic activity resumes properly and make later debt repayment sustainable this is a suggestion by martin guzman an argentine economist who teaches in new york and works with joseph stiglitz nobel laureate for economy guzman has just been appointed minister for economy and finance in alberto fernandez new government and a majority of the people clearly reject the imf whose deleterious impact on argentina is obvious to all and sundry it has to be remembered that after the second world war president juan domingo perón had turned down his country s adhesion to the imf an institution he exposed as an instrument of imperialism argentina only joined the imf in 1956 during the military dictatorship of general pedro eugenio aramburu silveti who overthrew the constitutional president juan domingo perón in 1955 twenty years later the imf actively supported the bloody dictatorship of general jorge rafael videla who was responsible for the assassination of over 30 000 left wing opponents in the 1990s the imf put argentina under pressure to turn it into one of the most active countries in terms of privatizations and structural adjustment structural adjustment economic policies imposed by the imf in exchange of new loans or the rescheduling of old loans structural adjustments policies were enforced in the early 1980 to qualify countries for new loans or for debt rescheduling by the imf and the world bank the requested kind of adjustment aims at ensuring that the country can again service its external debt structural adjustment usually combines the following elements devaluation of the national currency in order to bring down the prices of exported goods and attract strong currencies rise in interest rates in order to attract international capital reduction of public expenditure streamlining of public services staff reduction of budgets devoted to education and the health sector etc massive privatisations reduction of public subsidies to some companies or products freezing of salaries to avoid inflation as a consequence of deflation these saps have not only substantially contributed to higher and higher levels of indebtedness in the affected countries they have simultaneously led to higher prices because of a high vat rate and of the free market prices and to a dramatic fall in the income of local populations as a consequence of rising unemployment and of the dismantling of public services among other factors imf this eventually resulted in the massive upheaval of december 2001 which led to the fall of president fernando de la rúa during the public lectures organized by attac cadtm in collaboration with some ten other associations in buenos aires from 27 to 29 november 2019 i had the opportunity as international spokesperson for the cadtm to put forward a number of proposals to face the argentine debt crisis those proposals are the result of wide ranging debates within the cadtm network this was also the case at a hearing held in the parliament of argentina on 27 november at the initiative of economist fernanda vallejos an mp in the new presidential majority see my contribution in spanish the following is a summary of my points and proposals there should be no hesitation in arguing the doctrine of odious debt odious debt according to the doctrine for a debt to be odious it must meet two conditions 1 it must have been contracted against the interests of the nation or against the interests of the people or against the interests of the state 2 creditors cannot prove they they were unaware of how the borrowed money would be used we must underline that according to the doctrine of odious debt the nature of the borrowing regime or government does not signify since what matters is what the debt is used for if a democratic government gets into debt against the interests of its population the contracted debt can be called odious if it also meets the second condition consequently contrary to a misleading version of the doctrine odious debt is not only about dictatorial regimes see éric toussaint the doctrine of odious debt from alexander sack to the cadtm the father of the odious debt doctrine alexander nahum sack clearly says that odious debts can be contracted by any regular government sack considers that a debt that is regularly incurred by a regular government can be branded as odious if the two above mentioned conditions are met he adds once these two points are established the burden of proof that the funds were used for the general or special needs of the state and were not of an odious character would be upon the creditors sack defines a regular government as follows by a regular government is to be understood the supreme power that effectively exists within the limits of a given territory whether that government be monarchical absolute or limited or republican whether it functions by the grace of god or the will of the people whether it express the will of the people or not of all the people or only of some whether it be legally established or not etc none of that is relevant to the problem we are concerned with so clearly for sack all regular governments whether despotic or democratic in one guise or another can incur odious debts because it is particularly applicable to the situation in which argentina finds itself according to this doctrine a debt is deemed odious and nullified if it fulfils two conditions it was taken on against the interests of the nation the people or the state the creditors are unable to prove that they were unaware that the debt was contrary to the interests of the nation it is to be pointed out that the nature of the political regime or the government is not taken into consideration in the doctrine the deciding factor is the use that is made of the debt if a democratically elected government puts its population into debt against their best interest this debt may be deemed odious it is erroneous to say that only debts taken on by dictatorial regimes may be deemed odious see there should be no hesitation in arguing the doctrine of odious debt because it is particularly applicable to the situation in which argentina finds itself it is fundamental that argentina unilaterally takes sovereign measures to improve its debt situation five principal examples pass laws prohibiting vulture funds suspend debt repayments bond holders must be registered with the buenos aires authorities setting up a citizens debt audit repudiation of current agreements with the imf 1 pass laws prohibiting vulture funds as belgium showed in 2008 and again in 2015 it is possible to pass laws restricting vulture funds see renaud vivien analyse de la loi belge du 12 juillet 2015 contre les fonds vautours et de sa conformité au droit de l ue in french the act of law is quite simple an investment fund cannot reclaim sums superior to what it paid to acquire treasury bills in fact vulture funds purchase the sovereign debts of countries with repayment difficulties at junk prices and then apply legal pressure on the government concerned to pay in full and so make profits sometimes amounting to several hundred per cent of their initial layout if argentina passed a similar law it would have some protection against vulture funds if many countries did the same vulture funds would be neutralized the practice of designating foreign jurisdictions such as new york or london with laws that are favourable to creditors as competent in the case of sovereign debt litigations must end 2 suspend debt repayments suspending debt repayments is one of the possibilities that permit governments to deal with financial and or humanitarian crises the country may declare suspension unilaterally many have done so it was the case of argentina between 2001 and 2005 for a total of 80 billion and the benefits followed in a collective book published by oup in 2010 stiglitz claims that russia in 1998 and argentina in the 2000s are proof that a unilateral suspension of debt repayment can be beneficial for countries that make this decision both theory and evidence suggest that the threat of a cut off of credit has probably been exaggerated p 48 when a country succeeds in enforcing debt relief on its creditors and uses funds that were formerly meant for repayment in order to finance an expansionist tax policy this yields positive results under this scenario the number of the firms that are forced into bankruptcy is lowered both because of the lower interest rates interest rates when a lends money to b b repays the amount lent by a the capital as well as a supplementary sum known as interest so that a has an interest in agreeing to this financial operation the interest is determined by the interest rate which may be high or low to take a very simple example if a borrows 100 million dollars for 10 years at a fixed interest rate of 5 the first year he will repay a tenth of the capital initially borrowed 10 million dollars plus 5 of the capital owed i e 5 million dollars that is a total of 15 million dollars in the second year he will again repay 10 of the capital borrowed but the 5 now only applies to the remaining 90 million dollars still due i e 4 5 million dollars or a total of 14 5 million dollars and so on until the tenth year when he will repay the last 10 million dollars plus 5 of that remaining 10 million dollars i e 0 5 million dollars giving a total of 10 5 million dollars over 10 years the total amount repaid will come to 127 5 million dollars the repayment of the capital is not usually made in equal instalments in the initial years the repayment concerns mainly the interest and the proportion of capital repaid increases over the years in this case if repayments are stopped the capital still due is higher the nominal interest rate is the rate at which the loan is contracted the real interest rate is the nominal rate reduced by the rate of inflation and because of the improved overall economic performance of the economy that follows as the economy strengthens government tax revenues increase again improving the fiscal position of the government all this means that the government s fiscal position is stronger going forward making it more not less likely that creditors will be willing to again provide finance p 48 in an article published in journal of development economics under the title the elusive costs of sovereign defaults eduardo levy yeyati and ugo panizza two economists who worked for the inter american development bank set out the findings of their thorough inquiry into defaulting in some forty countries one of their main conclusions is that default episodes mark the beginning of the economic recovery it couldn t be better put as was already done in 2001 argentina should not hesitate to declare a new unlimited suspension of payments the recuperated amounts could be used to stimulate consumer spending and economic activities favouring the population two years would appear to be a minimum period to achieve lasting results with the possibility of prolonging the period it is recommended to suspend selectively small savers and shareholders as well as public pension schemes should be exempted from suspension on the domestic debt this means that they would continue to be paid it is quite right to make this discrimination in order to protect the weaker investors and public institutions it is the big private investors and the imf who are to be defaulted 3 bond holders must be registered with the buenos aires authorities argentine authorities should revive the practice of the first half of the 20th century that established lists of bond holders in the litigation between mexico and its creditors in the 1940s the creditors were obliged to make themselves known and have their certificates rubber stamped or be excluded from settlement this permitted the cancellation of 90 of the mexican debt see registering bond holders makes it possible to sort big and small private and public bond holders in order to favour small and public holders 4 setting up a citizens debt audit to have a clear idea of the stakes and sums involved and a solid legal arsenal it is essential to conduct an audit of the debt under citizens control an audit would show how much of the debt possibly an overwhelming part may be deemed illegal or odious and could be the way forward towards debt repudiation and or a unilateral restructuring the real reason the imf granted such a huge loan was because the us president donald trump wanted to help macri remain in power to implement policies that favoured the us in political military and economic terms 5 repudiation of current agreements with the imf as has been shown by many observers and argentine jurists the agreements made with the imf by mauricio macri are contrary to the country s and the people s interests when the imf granted a loan of 57 billion to the macri government it transgressed its own rules that state that the imf can only grant loans if as a consequence the borrowing country s debt becomes sustainable which is not at all the case as evidenced less than a year later macri also transgressed the argentine constitution that requires that the signature of such an agreement that has the value of an international treaty must be debated in parliament and then be ratified by parliament the real reason the loan was granted was because the us president donald trump wanted to help macri remain in power in spite of the crisis and win the 2019 elections to implement policies that favoured the us in political military and economic terms as the argentine electors have disavowed macri s policies and macri had transgressed the argentine constitution the new government would have the right to refuse to validate the agreement this is a text book case of odious debt when a country sees regime change the new government is not held to respect the debts of its predecessors if they were taken on against the interest of the nation or the people and in the former regime s own advantage in this case to remain in power and it is clear that the imf directors were aware of the context it is important that argentina does not make the same errors of debt negotiation as in the 2002 2010 period see the analysis by maud bailly and eric toussaint the mixed fortunes of argentina s 2005 and 2010 debt restructuring the above measures should be part and parcel of a larger programme that would include capital controls socialization of the banking sector tax reforms measures against the extractivist exportation market model and ecological policies among others in conclusion a new situation will arise in argentina as from december 2019 a new government must face up to a serious debt crisis it is fundamental that a large popular social and political front be created in order by all necessary means to promote the solutions that will liberate the argentine people from the burden of illegitimate and odious debt translated by mike krolikowski and christine pagnoulle
monrovia liberia s state owned enterprises can make or break a country s economy or in some cases overburden them with when governance lapses are in abundance the sum total of 20 soes are government owned and make up several sectors including port services airport and civil aviation electricity supply oil and gas water and sewage agriculture and forestry maritime petroleum importation and storage and information communications services for a weah led government trumpeting a pro poor agenda these are key areas where the emphasis if laid right could help reduce the stress on government and set it on its way to fulfilling its key objectives sadly during the course of the year under review some of these institutions became notorious for breaching the public financial management pfm law of 2009 which sets out rules governing soe management and operations the year 2019 was a bad year for some soe s as major concession operations at a near standstill in liberia and some packing up and about to show liberia the door like the previous year this year found a number of high profile soe s enduring financial meltdowns and unable to rescue the national government while some have been able to stay afloat a lot of others are finding it difficult just to break even or perform simple salary payments for employees long before the weah government came into office the writings were already on the wall the former government of ellen johnson sirleaf pushed to dissolved a few soe s either for inability to perform or deliver or perhaps simply causing government more strains former president

terms of how much contribution they make to government s coffers this economists say is bad for a government and country heavily reliant on foreign aid today we look at the performance of the state owned enterprises liberia electricity corporation lec the lowdown the entity mandated to produce and supply economic and reliable electric power throughout liberia continues to struggle as more and more liberian crave consistent electricity not much has changed since the entity s formation in 1973 when electricity was largely limited to the capital of monrovia and its environs as liberia struggles to rebuild its power sector destroyed during a civil war which lasted from 1989 to 2003 the challenges remain enormous with only 12 of liberians and less than 20 of residents in the capital monrovia benefiting from electricity making liberia one of the lowest access rates in the world during the course of the year under review the lec commenced the commercialization of the rural electrification grids in grand gedeh and maryland counties after which residents and businesses connected to the grid to commence payment of electricity bills 2019 highs during the course of the year under review the lec broke grounds for the electrification of the pleebo to fish town corridor a component of the liberia energy efficiency access project leeap the separate groundbreaking ceremonies were held in pleebo maryland county and fish town rivergee county the leap is a 31 8m project jointly funded by the african development bank afdb the european union eu and the government of liberia the project entails the construction of 66kv double circuit transmission lines from paynesville to ria the construction of two new substations 66 22kv and 66 33kv the construction of medium and low

of electricity generated fell prey to illegal connections to homes and businesses causing losses of about us35m to the company in august the senate passed a bill submitted by president weah aptly dubbed the power theft bill with violation punishable as a felonious act the senate s action was based on a recommendation contained in a report submitted to plenary by the senate committee on lands mines energy and environment and judiciary in its decision to make power theft a felony the committee firstly defined it under the black law dictionary s 18th edition of 2004 as a serious crime usually punishable by imprisonment for more than one year or by death such as is brought against acts of burglary arson rape and murder grade d 2020 outlook when will electricity become consistent in liberia will the west african power pool finally become a reality national fisheries aquaculture authority the lowdown like agriculture the national fisheries and aquaculture authority has the potential to help the weah led government get out of the current financial mess it finds itself if utilized wisely and efficiently the fisheries sector could contribute immensely to national growth and development through huge support to the national budget to put it in a broad perspective the sector in the gambia contributes about 13 annually to government revenue the national fish per caput consumption average is 25 kg but it is as low as 9 kg in the inland areas as fish consumption is highest in coastal areas where fish production is high the artisanal subsector in the gambia employs between 25 000 and 30 000 people while about 2 000 people work in the industrial sub sector the livelihoods of an estimated 200 000 people are indirectly dependent on fisheries and related activities for women in particular fish processing and marketing provide an important source of income and livelihood support an estimated 80 percent of fish processors and 50 percent of small scale fish traders are women in neighboring guinea the national institute of statistics reports the contribution of the industry to the gdp is 15 8 percent while fisheries represent only 3 7 percent all the fisheries sectors contribute with more than 40 percent to the total state budget in ghana the fisheries sector is estimated to contribute about 3 percent of the nation s gross domestic product gdp and 5 percent of the agriculture gdp the per capita consumption of fish is estimated at about 25 kg per annum representing 60 percent of animal protein intake by the ghanaian populace in the ivory coast a modern fishing wharf opened since 1964 in abidjan which is africa s largest tuna fishing port handling about 100 000 tons of tuna each year there are fish hatcheries in bouake bamoro and korhogo commercial fishing for tuna is carried on in the gulf of guinea sardines are also caught in quantity the total catch was 71 841 tons in 2004 with commercial fishing accounting for 25 percent artisanal fishing 74 percent and aquaculture 1 percent the liberian fisheries sector has been underperforming unlike other countries because of outdated laws and lack of polices to probably manage the fishing sector during the 1970 liberia generated at least 40m per annum from the mesurado fishing pier on export of shrimps which happens to be one of our main commercial species to japan director general emma metieh glassco is on record for acknowledging that the development of coastal communities could lead to the creating of more job opportunities for liberians to reduce the current hardships and more importantly make the fisheries sector more commercialized where private investors will be operating fish processing facilities across the coastal communities during the course of the year under review nafaa held discussions with the world bank for a fisheries project valued at us 21 million phase 2 of that project dubbed the west africa regional fisheries project warfp came to an end as a result of the pause on regional project by the bank in december 2018 it has now been increased to us 40m subsequent to the agreement in july 2019 to continue with as a national project the project titled sustainable management of the fisheries project aims to sustain the gains of the warfp in liberia and develop national capacity to improve the value added and increase the economic contribution to the fisheries sectors and the restoration of key infrastructure to enhance the sector contribution to the economy this new world bank national fisheries project will focus on the rehabilitation and expansion of the mesurado fishing pier to a state of the art modern fishing port with onshore processing facilities for value addition it will also prioritize the establishment of landing jetties targeted in five coastal counties with densely populated fishing communities such as montserrado grand bassa county etc in an effort to reduce to huge post harvest loss and supply the domestic market with high quality of fish products which has a fish demand deficit of 33 000metric tons with infrastructure development in the fisheries sector liberia will be in a strong position to compete with its next door neighbor and gravitate from a regime of only issuance of license for wild marine fisheries to a fully industrialize and commercialized fishing industry which includes huge exports proceeds signing of fish access agreement through bilateral arrangements such as eu liberia or senegal liberia as well as with private tuna fishing industry when implemented the project will greatly impart the liberian fisheries sector as there exist a need for a state of the art fishing and processing facilities and landing jetties in all of the nine coastal counties 2019 highs during the course of the year under review nafaa gain accession and ratification of the port state measure agreement psma which is an international fao fisheries instrument that has been deposited at food agriculture organization headquarters italy nafaa also developed a national plan of action on illegal unreported and unregulated fishing activities npoa iuu which has also been deposited at fao headquarters the agency also received fisheries patrol boat from wales to monitor our territorial waters against illegal fishing and signed senegal partnership agreement to attract investment in the sector additionally nafaa signed a 3 1 million usd agreement with icelandic government for establishment of competent laboratory for testing and certification of fish product and another bilateral agreement with japan for the supply of motorize boats which will increase the fish productivity on the local market nafaa also signed a partnership agreement with fao for fish stock assessment to know the status of stocks available which helps to inform management decision on the fisheries quota allocation system in regards to the issuance of fishing license nafaa also signed a private tuna fisheries

coastal environment training and capacity building of human resources monitoring control and surveillance of fisheries and safety at sea for artisanal fishermen among other important measures in liberia amid the controversy the government scrambled for answers to put local fishermen at ease in the end plenary of the house of representatives voted to endorse a report from its joint committee on agriculture forestry and fisheries and investment and concession that the fishery agreement is a no deal the report said the fishery agreement is still at its embryonic pre natal stage and needs to reach its threshold or maturity to meet legislative involvement because the ministries of justice and finance and development planning are yet to sign the agreement to become a legal and binding instrument for ratification of the house of representatives and the liberian senate the house s joint committee further said that any senegalese business institution interested in the liberian waters must meet the pre conditions and all criteria set for licenses under our laws for nafaa the senegalese agreement was controversial because of misconceptions on the protocol of the agreement after clarity was provided to both houses than it was than agreed that the executives should go ahead and complete the process before resubmission however at the time both the justice minister and the finance had not attested to the document also the agreement did not reach the us 10 million threshold to be brought to the legislature therefore the executive can now proceed with the implementation of the protocol which has already been attested nafaa believes the senegalese agreement has the potential of attracting huge investment to the sector which cover all the different aspects such as the onshore processing and value addition for exports to international markets expansion of the industrial tuna fishing introduction of new fisheries licensing regime such as shrimps and octopus fishing as the liberian coastal waters has high productivity for shellfish fishing it attracts onshore processing such as canning factory fish mill as well as a robust semi industrial program which intends to supply the local market thus decreasing the net importation of fish product 2020 outlook will the coming year see nafaa stepping it up a notch and fulfill its potential and endless possibilities grade

leaving the compound for several hours c abayemi cassell secretary general of the lwsc workers union summed aptly up the problem well the management of the liberia water and sewer corporation has been very inhumane to workers of the corporation they have been giving us very misleading information as it relates to our salaries and benefits this month makes it exactly five months we have not taken

ports freeport of monrovia port of buchanan port of greenville and port of harper struggled to break even freeport which is the main port and once regarded as a key contributor to the national budget is only a shell of what it once was the port which once boasted record setting 7 452 492 metric tons of cargo at its docks even during the days of the 2014 ebola outbreak fell short of expectations during the year this was evident in july when managing director bill twehway who replaced celia cuffy brown acknowledged the dip in numbers upon his return from next door guinea we have come to guinea to look at the port of conakry and to find out why our people are coming to guinea to import their goods drive their goods from here for more than three days into monrovia rather than using the free port of monrovia that is closed to them according to twehway his trip to guinea showed him that there was a strong need to act as urgently as possible to make the free port of monrovia gateway to liberia s economy affordable for importers and exporters most of whom are using alternative means to import or export their goods the sad reality of mr twehway s denial is that the current government met the gateway in a much better shape then it has not been denigrated to twehway s new obsession with transforming the free port of monrovia to make it affordable for good public service suggest that the npa may have kissed its best days goodbye 2019 highs the cancellation of demurrage payments and charges on all containers being shipped into the country as of april 1 2019 was a rare high point for the port and although it did little to improve revenues it offered a small cushion for shippers the port management acknowledged that the decision was necessary to alleviate the unwarranted hardship and huge financial nightmare on shippers and members of the business community suffered over the years demurrage is a charge levied by shipping agencies to the importers in cases where they have not taken delivery of the full container and move it out of the port or terminal for unpacking within the allowed line free days the npa management says the imposition of demurrage in 2016 by the past government cost huge losses to shippers and diversion of consignments and containers to neighboring ports 2019 lows two steps forward two steps backwards despite dropping demurrage fees and laying the blame on the past government the port management would trigger new controversy of its own when it signed a container tracking deal with global tracking and maritime solutions liberia a company chased out of sierra leone for allegedly defrauding the sierra leonean government over us 11 million under the deal and based on the agreement gmt solutions would track all containers coming

delta airlines the deal with hartsfield jackson halted the ria s reliance on the south africa aviation sector for its aircraft maintenance in addition the move also contributed to job creation and boost to the aviation sector as aircrafts from several other countries in the region will turn to liberia for aircraft spare parts and repairs liberia already has the longest runway in west africa which is about 11 000 feet that has been rehabilitated making it suitable for more international airlines to resume flights to the country 2019 lows when the escalator at the newly renovated us 50

sector in the absence of a national carrier the lcaa is left with a few chartered companies offering their services internally and regionally with the united nations mission in liberia no longer in the country workload for the lcaa has slowed a bit although the pending arrival of air france in the new year should improve business the lcaa s woes were evident during the course of the year under review when managing director emmanuel nuquay appealed for more allocation in the national budget for nuquay the lack of adequate budgetary support is keeping management from ensuring stringent implementation of high cable standards and recommended practices in terms of executions of critical elements of safety oversight system and aviation security oversight system which is very cardinal to

the bank had hit new highs as they pledged to work to restore the bank s independence and credibility much of the cbl s frailties were owed to its own doing and failure to adequately provide the necessary information to the public a case in point the sudden appearance of freshly minted ld banknotes toward the tail end of the year in review as mind boggling as it seemed liberians endured more than a year of hardships pains and suffering after being told there were simply no ld notes in the country they whined about mutilated liberian dollar banknotes from commercial banks as many institutions simply told their customers there was no ld notes available suddenly in the dog days of the christmas holidays new banknotes appear the new banknotes according to the minister of information lenn eugene nagbe had been in the vaults of the cbl all along and that the bank routinely disburses money whenever it sees it fit to do so the central bank of liberia has issued out to commercial banks unused liberian dollar banknotes that have been in its custody in the vaults the bank puts out banknotes used and unused from time to time as a routine exercise to meet the liquidity needs of commercial banks for the record this administration has not printed any new banknotes minister nagbe said the explanation is turning out to be a tough sell to a skeptical public unsure what to make of it especially coming 24 hours after montserrado county district 10 representative yekeh kolubah blew the alarm that new banknotes had been printed the saga sums up how strange a year it has been for the cbl much of the year under review was dominated over the resignation of former governor nathaniel patray the president looking to overhaul of the cbl s leadership and restore confidence in an institution beset by scandals announced in may that patray would retire in three months it took five months for patray to finally take his bow when the president accepted the resignation on

allegedly invested into cocopa rubber plantation corporation by nasscorp in 2017 senator sando johnson npp bomi county requested the body to invite managing director dewitt von ballmoos to provide a detailed explanation of the transaction carried out by nasscorp senator johnson in his communication stated that being aware that money within the custody of nasscorp is collected from workers across the country with the intent of providing retirement and other social reimbursements to beneficiaries it is significant to know the intent of the investment nasscorp needs to provide reasons to the plenary of the liberian senate as to why they are investing our people moneys at a time when the present government is phasing out there is a tendency that accountability could be lax and people could carry on dubious acts he stated 2019 highs during the course of the year under review nasscorp reported that it enrolled more than 4 300 pensioners the coordinator for public sector and claims department madam mahdea belleka said out of 17 541 beneficiaries the entity has processed about 4 305 so far in march firestone liberia inc announced changes to its employee pension program effective

commission tc on investment of social security funds of the international social security association issa for another three year term 2019 lows this year like many previous years nasscorp this year was again at the center of controversies over delayed payment of pension benefits which led to a group of disenchanted pensioners planning to stage a protest the protest was however called off grade c 2020 outlook nasscorp could play a critical role in helping the government achieve its pro poor agenda for prosperity and development through increased investment in infrastructure and improving pension payment mechanisms liberia national lottery the lowdown the statutory authority responsible for regulating lottery in liberia and mandated to engage in lottery and other gaming or chance business to generate funds for the government endured a rough spell during the course of the year under review in april president weah suspended mr martin s kollie managing director of the national lottery authority nla for time indefinite and further ordered to turn over all government properties in his possession and to cooperate with the investigation his deputy managing director for operations at the nla hon nevad kortu has been acting since the year before the lna was embroiled in another scandal when it went to the supreme court to complain that its account was frozen by the ministry of finance development planning mfdp despite previous order unfreeze the court previously ordered solicitor general daku mulbah to instruct mfdp to allow the agency operates like the way it used to prior to new appointments by president george weah cllr stanley kparkillen told the court that the mandates given the mfdp were not adhered to as the ministry is currently allowing all vouchers and checks to be approved by the minister of fiscal affairs samora wolokolie much of the problems with the lna borders around political interference a year ago president weah sparked controversy when he wrestled oversight responsibilities of the lotteries from the office of the vice president in what many insiders say is a last ditch effort by the president to shift power and influence away from his vice president section 1 amendment to part iii regarding the establishment of the board immediately upon the passage of this act part iii section 15 2 a reads the board shall consist of seven 7 members a senior policy staff of the office of the vice president of liberia as chairman with the right to cast a deciding vote in addition to his her regular vote is hereby amended to read as follows 15 2 the board shall consists of seven 7 members a chairman to be appointed by the president with the right to cast a deciding vote the act shall take effect immediately upon publication into handbill a year later the nla found itself struggling to dismiss report that the vice president was influencing decision at the entity the nla in a statement distanced the vice president from the controversy and speculations stating that the vice president as a legal luminary and a respecter of the law cannot be in violation of any constitutional instrument including the laws governing the gambling sector of the country 2019 highs a dysfunctional disjointed and disorganized organization did very little during the year under review 2019 lows during the year under review an audit by the general auditing commission found that us 2 7m could not be accounted for up to the end of the year it was unclear whether the nla administration headed by mr martin s kollie would have expended huge amount of monies supposedly without any documentation and or proper authorization kollie has not taken the matter lying down and lawyers representing his legal interest are seeking legal redress at the supreme court of liberia against what they called their client s illegal suspension the nla also came under fire during the course of the year when it shut down doxxbet company for allegedly refusing to comply with government standing regulations regarding the betting industry citing the regulation that betting company is allow to bring into the country more than twenty slots of betting machines at cost of us 20 million the regulation according to the nla states that anything other than the twenty machines would lead to such company paying us 500 00 per each additional machine doxxbet took issue with the nla dismissing the accusations grade f 2020 outlook will the act to amend part iii section 15 2 a of an act to repeal the act incorporating the liberia national lotteries corporation of 1993 see passage in the new year liberia regulatory authority the lowdown the liberian petroleum regulatory authority lpra was created by the exploration petroleum law of 2014 separating nocal s functions and creating lpra as the country s regulator the 1st director of lpra was edward smith in early 2018 but later resigned by november of the same year little is known professionally about archie n donmo who replaced edward smith other than he was a banker for many years with ecobank lpra being a newly minted entity many on the ground believed that the person heading such an important regulatory role should have a background working in the oil sector according to article 75 1 and 75 2 of the new petroleum e p law of 2014 the lpra is to make regulations for giving effect to the provisions of the act the law states that the regulations should be done in consultation with the relevant government agencies and public hearings discussing the drafting of each regulation to date no such exercises have been carried out by the authority indicating that no regulations have been made for the sector in fulfilment of lpra s regulatory mandate the question is if the anticipated bid round can take place without the regulations 2019 highs the government of liberia through the liberia petroleum regulatory authority lpra and the national oil company of liberia nocal has taken steps toward rebuilding a vibrant and viable oil and gas program by improving governance transparency accountability and equity participation of all liberians the move is in keeping with section 78 of the petroleum exploration and production reform act of 2014 the government according to a release wishes to inform the public and its international partners that the transfer plan referred to and required in the petroleum law has been completed this signals two major milestones the full transfer of all regulatory functions from nocal to lpra allowing nocal to focus on improving the commercial capabilities and promoting the government s interest and citizen participation and this allows for lpra to immediately commence key activities leading to the bid activities of offshore acreages the president of the republic of liberia george m weah challenged the ceo of nocal and the director general of lpra to engage with international oil companies and other global partners in building an economically successful and sustainable oil and gas sector one that will maximize government s take ensure environmental sustainability and equitable participation of all liberians 2019 lows things have not been looking good at lpra against the advice of those on the board and a senior level advisor within lpra as well as nocal and the upper echelon members of president weah s advisory team mr donmo signed a contract with tgs nopec that could potentially rob liberia of millions of dollars in potential revenue at press time fpa learned that despite the signing lpra had no authority to sign according to the petroleum law and the contract is being deemed as invalid by the ministry of justice most troubling in 2019 lpra issued a reconnaissance license to deeco limited similar to the license issued to simba energy for data acquisition over an area in bong county the license given to deeco limited was never administered because the lpra failed to do the necessary background investigation on deeco grade f 2020 outlook there are high hopes for liberia s petroleum sector and the announced bid round is a vital part of liberia s recovery the anticipation is that lpra begins the consultation process for the much needed regulations liberia bank for development investment the lowdown the liberia bank for development and investment is a state owned bank with a compelling task to provide incentives to simulate the flow of private investment capital an fuel the engine of national and international trade foremost among the incentives which the government of liberia considered to be imperative in pursuance of this goal was the creation of lbdi include facilitate the creation and expansion of small medium and large scale productive businesses such as agro industrial and service including tourism enterprises and provide increased goods and services for the rapidly growing consumption requirements of the economy 2019 highs after 54 years of existence the liberia bank for development and investment lbdi finally come off age with a new five year strategic plan designed to transition the bank into the new banking world the first of its kind in the country the new plan according to the bank s president mr john davies iii is designed to fit millennials into the banking system and revolutionize the way banking is done in liberia it is meant to bring banking at the doorsteps of customers the first real fruits of that five year strategic plan are going to come out by november of this year the bank has invested in a brand new state of the art ultra modern banking system in fact in west africa we would probably be the third bank to move to that system mr davies bragged in october this year the new system is designed to reduce banking bureaucracies ensure customer convenience amongst others this means customers would now have full control of activities relating to their accounts without having to queue to meet a teller of a customer service agent as part of its plan for an improved customer service the bank would be recruiting the first 500 agents across the country with special emphasis on where lbdi customers are based on the analysis of their data base and also where the bank does not have a presence like lofa county the 500 agents would eventually be increased to over 3 000 over a three year period 2019 lows lbdi was hard hit by the shortage of liberian dollars leaving many of its customers stranded the situation was however not unique to lbdi but affected its ability to effectively carry out some of its key functions grade c 2020 outlook customers look forward to how the complete digitalization of the bank would impact the way they do business positively liberia petroleum refining company the lowdown the primary statutory obligation of the liberia petroleum refinery company lprc is to ensure adequate and consistent supply of petroleum products on the liberian market effectuating this task has always generated mixed reactions from the public whether from owners or users of vehicles manufacturers or consumers the prices of petroleum products are inseparable from the factors that drive transportation fares which remain the engine of domestic trade and commerce in liberia in 2019 the year under review the prices of petroleum products fluctuated month by month and when there were apparent shortages retailers were accused of holding thereby causing hike in the prices while the lprc and other relevant government ministries and agency were condemned for not enforcing appropriate measures to avert fuel shortage and its ramifications meanwhile during the year under review the lprc experienced the appointment of two managing directors respectively first it was ms nyemadi d pearson steering the wheel at the lprc and by june president george weah opted for ms marie urey coleman as pearson s successor 2019 highs although the lprc faced some public backlashes for its periodic shortage of petroleum on the market thereby causing price hike they had insistently argued that importation of petro was delayed by vessels transporting the products to the country there were also reductions in the prices of petroleum products gasoline was reduced by fifteen 0 15 united states cents while there was an increase of ten 0 10 united states cents in the pump prices of diesel fuel ago on the liberian market the lprc also completed the product storage terminal pst rehabilitation expansion project and the new operation building in 2019 experts at the time who toured the facilities described them as a pre defined quality assurance standard which meets best international standard the operation building now has several offices while the pst has an increased volumetric capacity of from 61 431mt to 91 422 mt representing 33 in addition to a new bitumen storage tank with a capacity of 10 000 mt also a rehabilitation and expansion project of the tecxico tank farm will be increased from 61 431mt to 91 422 mt representing 33 or 91 422mt a 10 000 mt capacity bitumen storage tank the lprc disclosed in the year under review 2019 lows sporadic shortage or lack of petroleum on the market at certain time of the year made the lprc unpopular amongst commercial motorists and passengers alike local businesses struggled to keep their generators on while prices of basic commodities in rural liberia were doubled because transportation had also doubled or tripled also during the year mr ben sanvee s resignation as member of the board brought the lprc under public scrutiny sanvee following his resignation appeared on the costa show to lambast the running of the lprc he asserted that the lprc needed a complete overhaul and later during the year the house of representatives on thursday june 20 2019 during the 40th day sitting expressed their disappointments and frustration because major petroleum dealers had refused to pay road fund levies that was after the companies had agreed to withdraw their case from the court the delays by petroleum importers to pay road fund levy landed the management in hot water with the lawmakers representatives clarence massaquoi joseph somwarbi edward karfiah ben fofana matthew zarzar and nathaniel barway publically voiced their unhappiness and resentments over the unwanted delay and said the lprc was partially reasonable for the delays grade d 2020 outlook with the stability in the price of gasoline at the end of the year the lprc is expected to stay the course and ensure importers and retailers are checkmated there will also be scrutiny about the lprc role in the collection of fuel levy for the national road fund which is intended for the maintenance of roads and bridges in the country national housing authority nha the lowdown the national housing authority nha was one of those liberian government s agencies that were always in the news they had some kind of activities either negative or positive in almost all of the last 12 months of 2019 2019 lows the nha year began in january with the first judicial circuit criminal court c at the temple of justice issuing a writ of arrest for their former bosses including duannah siryon for their alleged involvement with the bribery scandal according to the writ siryon tugbeh c tugbeh nha isaac roberts nha augustine weah executive director of guss group of companies and emmanuel tapsoda gelpaz immo representative were indicted for the crimes of economic sabotage theft of property bribery misapplication of entrusted property and criminal conspiracy the grand jury for montserrado county republic of liberia upon their oath do hereby find more probably than not that the defendants duannah siryon tugbeh c tugbeh isaac roberts and augustine weah to be identified committed the crime of economic sabotage a felony of the first degree excerpt of the indictment read based on the writ it appeared damning for the nha which had begun on a somewhat good note at the inception of the george weah lead regime in 2018 few months further into the year the very same burkinabe construction company that siryon and others had been accused of receiving bribes from to favor was again presented with a contract for the construction of housing units by the new nha team which had taken over from the siryon led team at the nha this was a somewhat redux of the infamous sable mining exposé the gelpaz national housing authority corruption saga that saw siryon his principal deputies and officials of gelpaz land in jail for alleged bribery and solicitation of bribes took another trend despite the case being in court for alleged bribery gelpaz and the national housing authority nha signed a memorandum of understanding in october 2018 for the construction of 50 000 low cost housing units throughout the 15 counties of liberia however things went amiss between the nha and the burkina faso based real estate developer after a leaked secret recording alleging some big shots in government requested bribes as compensation for the consummation of the contract was exposed by frontpageafrica pictures of the contract signing were posted to facebook on july 10 2019 by madam celia cuffy brown who was appointed two weeks earlier by the president as the new managing director of the nha sources closed to the developments at the nha had informed this newspaper that ms cuffy brown would have issued a press statement to announce the signing of the contract which she regarded as a big achievement for the short period of time she has headed the housing authority frontpageafrica was informed that the consummation of the contract was pushed by the minister of state nathaniel mcgill it was the same mcgill s name which was mentioned in the leaked audio to have made financial demands to the company for the signing of the contract in the audio which was published by this newspaper in november 2018 the former representative of gelpaz in liberia augustine weah who is also the vice president of the company alleged that nha managing director mr duanah siryon had requested kickback in the tone of us 160 000 for nha us 100 000 for justice minister us 100 000 for nathaniel mcgill and us 100 000 for finance minister before the contract can be consummated according to weah he negotiated with siryon that they gelpaz did not have that amount of money on hand but had made some transfer via lbdi bank and could produce us 80 000 to be split between minister mcgill his team and the nha after that the us 80 000 was presented to duanah siryon and he told me i ll give you us 20 000 to keep and i ll take the us 60 000 to mcgill to disburse weah was heard saying on the leaked audio weah further alleged that the nha managing director requested and was offered a percentage in the construction but pleaded that such should be kept secret from his principal deputies the case dragged on throughout the year in the court until november when the criminal court c judge blamo dixon handed down on friday november 8 2019 his ruling acquitting siryon and all others from nha of all charges brought against them by the state the men had been indicted on december 14 2018 whether or not the prosecution proved its case beyond all reasonable the answer is no the prosecution willfully failed to establish its prima facie against the defendants in the absence of augustine weah and emmanuel taosoba officials of the burkinabe firm who allegedly brought the money there is no evidence at all to convict the defendants there is no proven evidence because emmanuel taosoba and augustine weah defendants escaped the bailiwick of the republic of liberia judge blamo had said when he ruled as the case was ongoing in october 2019 officers of the liberia national police flew in full swing to disperse a group of nha workers who had gathered to protest for 11 month salaries which had not been paid them the disenchanted employees of the housing authority had gathered in front the ministry of foreign affairs to protest the police arrested three of the peaceful protesters who were seen holding placard the three persons arrested according to their spokesman were taken into police custody the protesters then relocated to the ministry of education on third street sinkor and continued their protest the nha aggrieved staffs held placards bearing inscriptions like our children need to go to school we need to take care of our families we have waited for too long dixon n nebo spokesperson of the protesters told frontpageafrica that their concerns had been ignored on many occasions today is a sad day in liberia and the national housing authority workers are still in the street because we have tried all efforts used all the diplomatic means and our plights have not been adhered to and the best thing is to draw government attention nebo said they and many other public agencies are still dogged by this salary delay situation 2019 highs nevertheless there were many high moments too in the year authorities at the nha always had these highs in the form of letting the public know that they were entering new agreements with construction companies for the building of low cost housing units in parts of the country at least news of sort from the nha appeared in january february march may july august september and october of the year under review grade d 2020 outlook the year coming is going to be among the crucial years ahead for the national housing authority nearly all of that good news of agreements being signed between the nha and those construction companies are yet to be seen coming to fruition hopefully those projects might be jump started in 2020 the environmental protection agency the lowdown the environmental protection agency epa is the regulatory institution of the government of liberia for the sustainable management of the environment and its natural resources the agency was established by an act of the legislature november 26 2002 and published into hand bill on april 30 2003 the act creating the agency provides the legal mandates and authority to manage coordinate monitor and supervise in consultation with relevant line ministries agencies and organization and other relevant stakeholders for the protection of the environment and sustainable use of natural resources the act details the functions of the epa from the policy council to environmental inspectors the act also clearly explain the entire environmental impact assessment eia process in its totality 2019 highs the epa has been in the limelight this year at the just ended united nations conference on climate change cop 25 in madrid spain epa executive director dr nathaniel t blama sr signed an mou for the establishment of ecovillages in liberia the mou was signed with the global ecovillage network gen the deployment of ecovillages in liberia is intended to work with communities that face severe ecological challenges the programme will assist the government in achieving sustainable development goals considering the vulnerable groups such as women and children youth elders and most importantly people with disabilities this project will also bring to reality the ecotourism strategy developed by the forestry development authority fda in september this year the epa launched a rescue mission for west point the largest slum community in monrovia which is gradually sinking under water due to the situation the government has finally asked residents in red zone to evacuate dangerous spots to avoid fatality but the government says it needs us 40 million to secure the entire township from the rising sea levels though the government faces financial constraint epa is soliciting funding to erect coastal defenses in west point on thursday september 5 epa and its partners as well as other stakeholders validated the monrovia metropolitan coastal resilience project mcrp an initiative that would cost over us 28 million that seeks to address the issue of the violent rapid sea erosion taking place at the township of west point the violent waves from the sea which have caused erosion are now a perennial problem for the township that is home to about 75 000 people in august this year more than 75 homes were washed away by the violent sea waves but if the coastal resilience project is completed it will save the township from total collapse over the year the epa has conducted pieces of training for various stakeholders including journalists farmers and civil society organizations on the effects and impact of climate change and the climate actions they can take to avert climate change 2019 lows not much has been visible on the epa s efforts to curtail illegal occupation of swamplands which is leading to the massive destruction of mangroves mangroves protect shorelines from damaging storm and hurricane winds waves and floods mangroves also help prevent erosion by stabilizing sediments with their tangled root systems they maintain water quality and clarity filtering pollutants and trapping sediments originating from land grade c 2020 outlook with 100 people trained in environmental safeguarding it is expected that the epa s robustness would be felt more in the coming year the enforcement of environmental laws throughout the country
monrovia liberia s state owned enterprises can make or break a country s economy or in some cases overburden them with when governance lapses are in abundance the sum total of 20 soes are government owned and make up several sectors including port services airport and civil aviation electricity supply oil and gas water and sewage agriculture and forestry maritime petroleum importation and storage and information communications services for a weah led government trumpeting a pro poor agenda these are key areas where the emphasis if laid right could help reduce the stress on government and set it on its way to fulfilling its key objectives sadly during the course of the year under review some of these institutions became notorious for breaching the public financial management pfm law of 2009 which sets out rules governing soe management and operations the year 2019 was a bad year for some soe s as major concession operations at a near standstill in liberia and some packing up and about to show liberia the door like the previous year this year found a number of high profile soe s enduring financial meltdowns and unable to rescue the national government while some have been able to stay afloat a lot of others are finding it difficult just to break even or perform simple salary payments for employees long before the weah government came into office the writings were already on the wall the former government of ellen johnson sirleaf pushed to dissolved a few soe s either for inability to perform or deliver or perhaps simply causing government more strains former president sirleaf submitted a bill in 2015 to the national legislature seeking to dissolve six state owned enterprises the national insurance company of liberia nicol libyan liberia holding company llhc the liberia free zone authority lfza the liberia produce marketing corporation lpmc the bureau of state enterprises bse and the national food assistance program nfap respectively for sirleaf these institutions had outlived their viability and functionality and it is not in the interest of the liberian people to continue to support non functional enterprises with public resources over the years the major contributors to the economy have been the national port authority npa liberia electricity corporation lec roberts international airport ria liberia civil aviation authority lcaa national oil company of liberia nocal forestry development authority fda liberia maritime authority lma liberia petroleum refining corporation lprc liberia water and sewer corporation lwsc and liberia telecommunication authority lta these days the numbers and projects appear to be dwindling by the day more importantly the soe s have become a haven for political appointments with little to show in terms of how much contribution they make to government s coffers this economists say is bad for a government and country heavily reliant on foreign aid today we look at the performance of the state owned enterprises liberia electricity corporation lec the lowdown the entity mandated to produce and supply economic and reliable electric power throughout liberia continues to struggle as more and more liberian crave consistent electricity not much has changed since the entity s formation in 1973 when electricity was largely limited to the capital of monrovia and its environs as liberia struggles to rebuild its power sector destroyed during a civil war which lasted from 1989 to 2003 the challenges remain enormous with only 12 of liberians and less than 20 of residents in the capital monrovia benefiting from electricity making liberia one of the lowest access rates in the world during the course of the year under review the lec commenced the commercialization of the rural electrification grids in grand gedeh and maryland counties after which residents and businesses connected to the grid to commence payment of electricity bills 2019 highs during the course of the year under review the lec broke grounds for the electrification of the pleebo to fish town corridor a component of the liberia energy efficiency access project leeap the separate groundbreaking ceremonies were held in pleebo maryland county and fish town rivergee county the leap is a 31 8m project jointly funded by the african development bank afdb the european union eu and the government of liberia the project entails the construction of 66kv double circuit transmission lines from paynesville to ria the construction of two new substations 66 22kv and 66 33kv the construction of medium and low

capacity at the lec rural renewable energy agency rrea environmental protection agency epa and the ministry of mines and energy mme the launched of the leeap in pleebo and fish town signifies the lec commitment to improving people s livelihood through the provision of reliable and affordable electricity 2019 lows the lec continues to struggle to curb power theft during the year nearly 70 percent of electricity generated fell prey to illegal connections to homes and businesses causing losses of about us35m to the company in august the senate passed a bill submitted by president weah aptly dubbed the power theft bill with violation punishable as a felonious act the senate s action was based on a recommendation contained in a report submitted to plenary by the senate committee on lands mines energy and environment and judiciary in its decision to make power theft a felony the committee firstly defined it under the black law dictionary s 18th edition of 2004 as a serious crime usually punishable by imprisonment for more than one year or by death such as is brought against acts of burglary arson rape and murder grade d 2020 outlook when will electricity become consistent in liberia will the west african power pool finally become a reality national fisheries aquaculture authority the lowdown like agriculture the national fisheries and aquaculture authority has the potential to help the weah led government get out of the current financial mess it finds itself if utilized wisely and efficiently the fisheries sector could contribute immensely to national growth and development through huge support to the national budget to put it in a broad perspective the sector in the gambia contributes about 13 annually to government revenue the national fish per caput consumption average is 25 kg but it is as low as 9 kg in the inland areas as fish consumption is highest in coastal areas where fish production is high the artisanal subsector in the gambia employs between 25 000 and 30 000 people while about 2 000 people work in the industrial sub sector the livelihoods of an estimated 200 000 people are indirectly dependent on fisheries and related activities for women in particular fish processing and marketing provide an important source of income and livelihood support an estimated 80 percent of fish processors and 50 percent of small scale fish traders are women in neighboring guinea the national institute of statistics reports the contribution of the industry to the gdp is 15 8 percent while fisheries represent only 3 7 percent all the fisheries sectors contribute with more than 40 percent to the total state budget in ghana the fisheries sector is estimated to contribute about 3 percent of the nation s gross domestic product gdp and 5 percent of the agriculture gdp the per capita consumption of fish is estimated at about 25 kg per annum representing 60 percent of animal protein intake by the ghanaian populace in the ivory coast a modern fishing wharf opened since 1964 in abidjan which is africa s largest tuna fishing port handling about 100 000 tons of tuna each year there are fish hatcheries in bouake bamoro and korhogo commercial fishing for tuna is carried on in the gulf of guinea sardines are also caught in quantity the total catch was 71 841 tons in 2004 with commercial fishing accounting for 25 percent artisanal fishing 74 percent and aquaculture 1 percent the liberian fisheries sector has been underperforming unlike other countries because of outdated laws and lack of polices to probably manage the fishing sector during the 1970 liberia generated at least 40m per annum from the mesurado fishing pier on export of shrimps which happens to be one of our main commercial species to japan director general emma metieh glassco is on record for acknowledging that the development of coastal communities could lead to the creating of more job opportunities for liberians to reduce the current hardships and more importantly make the fisheries sector more commercialized where private investors will be operating fish processing facilities across the coastal communities during the course of the year under review nafaa held discussions with the world bank for a fisheries project valued at us 21 million phase 2 of that project dubbed the west africa regional fisheries project warfp came to an end as a result of the pause on regional project by the bank in december 2018 it has now been increased to us 40m subsequent to the agreement in july 2019 to continue with as a national project the project titled sustainable management of the fisheries project aims to sustain the gains of the warfp in liberia and develop national capacity to improve the value added and increase the economic contribution to the fisheries sectors and the restoration of key infrastructure to enhance the sector contribution to the economy this new world bank national fisheries project will focus on the rehabilitation and expansion of the mesurado fishing pier to a state of the art modern fishing port with onshore processing facilities for value addition it will also prioritize the establishment of landing jetties targeted in five coastal counties with densely populated fishing communities such as montserrado grand bassa county etc in an effort to reduce to huge post harvest loss and supply the domestic market with high quality of fish products which has a fish demand deficit of 33 000metric tons with infrastructure development in the fisheries sector liberia will be in a strong position to compete with its next door neighbor and gravitate from a regime of only issuance of license for wild marine fisheries to a fully industrialize and commercialized fishing industry which includes huge exports proceeds signing of fish access agreement through bilateral arrangements such as eu liberia or senegal liberia as well as with private tuna fishing industry when implemented the project will greatly impart the liberian fisheries sector as there exist a need for a state of the art fishing and processing facilities and landing jetties in all of the nine coastal counties 2019 highs during the course of the year under review nafaa gain accession and ratification of the port state measure agreement psma which is an international fao fisheries instrument that has been deposited at food agriculture

fishing 2019 lows nafaa was not without controversy during the course of the year under review following the signing of a five year agreement with its west african neighbors senegal to exploit liberian territorial waters and in return provide training and support to local fisherman and the fishing industry the five year agreement which is also renewable for equal period will grant senegal greenlight to the exploitation and the management of the marine resources the enhancement and commercialization of fishery and aquaculture products fisheries research preservation of the marine and coastal environment training and capacity building of human resources monitoring control and surveillance of fisheries and safety at sea for artisanal fishermen among other important measures in liberia amid the controversy the government scrambled for answers to put local fishermen at ease in the end plenary of the house of representatives voted to endorse a report from its joint committee on agriculture forestry and fisheries and investment and concession that the fishery agreement is a no deal the report said the fishery agreement is still at its embryonic pre natal stage and needs to reach its threshold or maturity to meet legislative involvement because the ministries of justice and finance and development planning are yet to sign the agreement to become a legal and binding instrument for ratification of the house of representatives and the liberian senate the house s joint committee further said that any senegalese business institution interested in the liberian waters must meet the pre conditions and all criteria set for licenses under our laws for nafaa the senegalese agreement was controversial because of misconceptions on the protocol of the agreement after clarity was provided to both houses than it was than agreed that the executives should go ahead and complete the process before resubmission however at the time both the justice minister and the finance had not attested to the document also the agreement did not reach the us 10 million threshold to be brought to the legislature therefore the executive can now proceed with the implementation of the protocol which has already been attested nafaa believes the senegalese agreement has the potential of attracting huge investment to the sector which cover all the different aspects such as the onshore processing and value addition for exports to international markets expansion of the industrial tuna fishing introduction of new fisheries licensing regime such as shrimps and octopus fishing as the liberian coastal waters has high productivity for shellfish fishing it attracts onshore processing such as canning factory fish mill as well as a robust semi industrial program which intends to supply the local market thus decreasing the net importation of fish product 2020 outlook will the coming year see nafaa stepping it up a notch and fulfill its potential and endless possibilities grade

leaving the compound for several hours c abayemi cassell secretary general of the lwsc workers union summed aptly up the problem well the management of the liberia water and sewer corporation has been very inhumane to workers of the corporation they have been giving us very misleading information as it relates to our salaries and benefits this month makes it exactly five months we have not taken pay and seven months we have not gotten transportation allowance but every day they tell workers that you come to work if you do not come we will mark you absent grade f 2020 outlook whatever happened

ports freeport of monrovia port of buchanan port of greenville and port of harper struggled to break even freeport which is the main port and once regarded as a key contributor to the national budget is only a shell of what it once was the port which once boasted record setting 7 452 492 metric tons of cargo at its docks even during the days of the 2014 ebola outbreak fell short of expectations during the year this was evident in july when managing director bill twehway who replaced celia cuffy brown acknowledged the dip in numbers upon his return from next door guinea we have come to guinea to look at the port of conakry and to find out why our people are coming to guinea to import their goods drive their goods from here for more than three days into monrovia rather than using the free port of monrovia that is closed to them according to twehway his trip to guinea showed him that there was a strong need to act as urgently as possible to make the free port of monrovia gateway to liberia s economy affordable for importers and exporters most of whom are using alternative means to import or export their goods the sad reality of mr twehway s denial is that the current government met the gateway in a much better shape then it has not been denigrated to twehway s new obsession with transforming the free port of monrovia to make it affordable for good public service suggest that the npa may have kissed its best days goodbye 2019 highs the cancellation of demurrage payments and charges on all containers being shipped into the country as of april 1 2019 was a rare high point for the port and although it did little to improve revenues it offered a small cushion for shippers the port management acknowledged that the decision was necessary to alleviate the unwarranted hardship and huge financial nightmare on shippers and members of the business community suffered over the years demurrage is a charge levied by shipping agencies to the importers in cases where they have not taken delivery of the full container and move it out of the port or terminal for unpacking within the allowed line free days the npa management says the imposition of demurrage in 2016 by the past government cost huge losses to shippers and diversion of consignments and containers to neighboring ports 2019 lows two steps forward two steps backwards despite dropping demurrage fees and laying the blame on the past government the port management would trigger new controversy of its own when it signed a container tracking deal with global tracking and maritime solutions liberia a company chased out of sierra leone for allegedly defrauding the sierra leonean government over us 11 million under the deal and based on the agreement gmt solutions would track all containers coming

delta airlines the deal with hartsfield jackson halted the ria s reliance on the south africa aviation sector for its aircraft maintenance in addition the move also contributed to job creation and boost to the aviation sector as aircrafts from several other countries in the region will turn to liberia for aircraft spare parts and repairs liberia already has the longest runway in west africa which is about 11 000 feet that has been rehabilitated making it suitable for more international airlines to resume flights to the country 2019 lows when the escalator at the newly renovated us 50

sector in the absence of a national carrier the lcaa is left with a few chartered companies offering their services internally and regionally with the united nations mission in liberia no longer in the country workload for the lcaa has slowed a bit although the pending arrival of air france in the new year should improve business the lcaa s woes were evident during the course of the year under review when managing director emmanuel nuquay appealed for more allocation in the national budget for nuquay the lack of adequate budgetary support is keeping management from ensuring stringent implementation of high cable standards and recommended practices in terms of executions of critical elements of safety oversight system and aviation security oversight system which is very cardinal to

the bank had hit new highs as they pledged to work to restore the bank s independence and credibility much of the cbl s frailties were owed to its own doing and failure to adequately provide the necessary information to the public a case in point the sudden appearance of freshly minted ld banknotes toward the tail end of the year in review as mind boggling as it seemed liberians endured more than a year of hardships pains and suffering after being told there were simply no ld notes in the country they whined about mutilated liberian dollar banknotes from commercial banks as many institutions simply told their customers there was no ld notes available suddenly in the dog days of the christmas holidays new banknotes appear the new banknotes according to the minister of information lenn eugene nagbe had been in the vaults of the cbl all along and that the bank routinely disburses money whenever it sees it fit to do so the central bank of liberia has issued out to commercial banks unused liberian dollar banknotes that have been in its custody in the vaults the bank puts out banknotes used and unused from time to time as a routine exercise to meet the liquidity needs of commercial banks for the record this administration has not printed any new banknotes minister nagbe said the explanation is turning out to be a tough sell to a skeptical public unsure what to make of it especially coming 24 hours after montserrado county district 10 representative yekeh kolubah blew the alarm that new banknotes had been printed the saga sums up how strange a year it has been for the cbl much of the year under review was dominated over the resignation of former governor nathaniel patray the president looking to overhaul of the cbl s leadership and restore confidence in an institution beset by scandals announced in may that patray would retire in three months it took five months for patray to finally take his bow when the president accepted the resignation on

detailed explanation of the transaction carried out by nasscorp senator johnson in his communication stated that being aware that money within the custody of nasscorp is collected from workers across the country with the intent of providing retirement and other social reimbursements to beneficiaries it is significant to know the intent of the investment nasscorp needs to provide reasons to the plenary of the liberian senate as to why they are investing our people moneys at a time when the present government is phasing out there is a tendency that accountability could be lax and people could carry on dubious acts he stated 2019 highs during the course of the year under review nasscorp reported that it enrolled more than 4 300 pensioners the coordinator for public sector and claims department madam mahdea belleka said out of 17 541 beneficiaries the entity has processed about 4 305 so far in march firestone liberia inc announced changes to its employee pension program effective

liberia will continue to honor its pension obligations through company direct pension payments as in the past also during the year dg vonballmoos was reappointed chairperson of the technical commission tc on investment of social security funds of the international social security association issa for another three year term 2019 lows this year like many previous years nasscorp this year was again at the center of controversies over delayed payment of pension benefits which led to a group of disenchanted pensioners planning to stage a protest the protest was however called off grade c 2020 outlook nasscorp could play a critical role in helping the government achieve its pro poor agenda for prosperity and development through increased investment in infrastructure and improving pension payment mechanisms liberia national lottery the lowdown the statutory authority responsible for regulating lottery in liberia and mandated to engage in lottery and other gaming or chance business to generate funds for the government endured a rough spell during the course of the year under review in april president weah suspended mr martin s kollie managing director of the national lottery authority nla for time indefinite and further ordered to turn over all government properties in his possession and to cooperate with the investigation his deputy managing director for operations at the nla hon nevad kortu has been acting since the year before the lna was embroiled in another scandal when it went to the supreme court to complain that its account was frozen by the ministry of finance development planning mfdp despite previous order unfreeze the court previously ordered solicitor general daku mulbah to instruct mfdp to allow the agency operates like the way it used to prior to new appointments by president george weah cllr stanley kparkillen told the court that the mandates given the mfdp were not adhered to as the ministry is currently allowing all vouchers and checks to be approved by the minister of fiscal affairs samora wolokolie much of the problems with the lna borders around political interference a year ago president weah sparked controversy when he wrestled oversight responsibilities of the lotteries from the office of the vice president in what many insiders say is a last ditch effort by the president to shift power and influence away from his vice president section 1 amendment to part iii regarding the establishment of the board immediately upon the passage of this act part iii section 15 2 a reads the board shall consist of seven 7 members a senior policy staff of the office of the vice president of liberia as chairman with the right to cast a deciding vote in addition to his her regular vote is hereby amended to read as follows 15 2 the board shall consists of seven 7 members a chairman to be appointed by the president with the right to cast a deciding vote the act shall take effect immediately upon publication into handbill a year later the nla found itself struggling to dismiss report that the vice president was influencing decision at the entity the nla in a statement distanced the vice president from the controversy and speculations stating that the vice president as a legal luminary and a respecter of the law cannot be in violation of any constitutional instrument including the laws governing the gambling sector of the country 2019 highs a dysfunctional disjointed and disorganized organization did very little during the year under review 2019 lows during the year under review an audit by the general auditing commission found that us 2 7m could not be accounted for up to the end of the year it was unclear whether the nla administration headed by mr martin s kollie would have expended huge amount of monies supposedly without any documentation and or proper authorization kollie has not taken the matter lying down and lawyers representing his legal interest are seeking legal redress at the supreme court of liberia against what they called their client s illegal suspension the nla also came under fire during the course of the year when it shut down doxxbet company for allegedly refusing to comply with government standing regulations regarding the betting industry citing the regulation that betting company is allow to bring into the country more than twenty slots of betting machines at cost of us 20 million the regulation according to the nla states that anything other than the twenty machines would lead to such company paying us 500 00 per each additional machine doxxbet took issue with the nla dismissing the accusations grade f 2020 outlook will the act to amend part iii section 15 2 a of an act to repeal the act incorporating the liberia national lotteries corporation of 1993 see passage in the new year liberia regulatory authority the lowdown the liberian petroleum regulatory authority lpra was created by the exploration petroleum law of 2014 separating nocal s functions and creating lpra as the country s regulator the 1st director of lpra was edward smith in early 2018 but later resigned by november of the same year little is known professionally about archie n donmo who replaced edward smith other than he was a banker for many years with ecobank lpra being a newly minted entity many on the ground believed that the person heading such an important regulatory role should have a background working in the oil sector according to article 75 1 and 75 2 of the new petroleum e p law of 2014 the lpra is to make regulations for giving effect to the provisions of the act the law states that the regulations should be done in consultation with the relevant government agencies and public hearings discussing the drafting of each regulation to date no such exercises have been carried out by the authority indicating that no regulations have been made for the sector in fulfilment of lpra s regulatory mandate the question is if the anticipated bid round can take place without the regulations 2019 highs the government of liberia through the liberia petroleum regulatory authority lpra and the national oil company of liberia nocal has taken steps toward rebuilding a vibrant and viable oil and gas program by improving governance transparency accountability and equity participation of all liberians the move is in keeping with section 78 of the petroleum exploration and production reform act of 2014 the government according to a release wishes to inform the public and its international partners that the transfer plan referred to and required in the petroleum law has been completed this signals two major milestones the full transfer of all regulatory functions from nocal to lpra allowing nocal to focus on improving the commercial capabilities and promoting the government s interest and citizen participation and this allows for lpra to immediately commence key activities leading to the bid activities of offshore acreages the president of the republic of liberia george m weah challenged the ceo of nocal and the director general of lpra to engage with international oil companies and other global partners in building an economically successful and sustainable oil and gas sector one that will maximize government s take ensure environmental sustainability and equitable participation of all liberians 2019 lows things have not been looking good at lpra against the advice of those on the board and a senior level advisor within lpra as well as nocal and the upper echelon members of president weah s advisory team mr donmo signed a contract with tgs nopec that could potentially rob liberia of millions of dollars in potential revenue at press time fpa learned that despite the signing lpra had no authority to sign according to the petroleum law and the contract is being deemed as invalid by the ministry of justice most troubling in 2019 lpra issued a reconnaissance license to deeco limited similar to the license issued to simba energy for data acquisition over an area in bong county the license given to deeco limited was never administered because the lpra failed to do the necessary background investigation on deeco grade f 2020 outlook there are high hopes for liberia s petroleum sector and the announced bid round is a vital part of liberia s recovery the anticipation is that lpra begins the consultation process for the much needed regulations liberia bank for development investment the lowdown the liberia bank for development and investment is a state owned bank with a compelling task to provide incentives to simulate the flow of private investment capital an fuel the engine of national and international trade foremost among the incentives which the government of liberia considered to be imperative in pursuance of this goal was the creation of lbdi include facilitate the creation and expansion of small medium and large scale productive businesses such as agro industrial and service including tourism enterprises and provide increased goods and services for the rapidly growing consumption requirements of the economy 2019 highs after 54 years of existence the liberia bank for development and investment lbdi finally come off age with a new five year strategic plan designed to transition the bank into the new banking world the first of its kind in the country the new plan according to the bank s president mr john davies iii is designed to fit millennials into the banking system and revolutionize the way banking is done in liberia it is meant to bring banking at the doorsteps of customers the first real fruits of that five year strategic plan are going to come out by november of this year the bank has invested in a brand new state of the art ultra modern banking system in fact in west africa we would probably be the third bank to move to that system mr davies bragged in october this year the new system is designed to reduce banking bureaucracies ensure customer convenience amongst others this means customers would now have full control of activities relating to their accounts without having to queue to meet a teller of a customer service agent as part of its plan for an improved customer service the bank would be recruiting the first 500 agents across the country with special emphasis on where lbdi customers are based on the analysis of their data base and also where the bank does not have a presence like lofa county the 500 agents would eventually be increased to over 3 000 over a three year period 2019 lows lbdi was hard hit by the shortage of liberian dollars leaving many of its customers stranded the situation was however not unique to lbdi but affected its ability to effectively carry out some of its key functions grade c 2020 outlook customers look forward to how the complete digitalization of the bank would impact the way they do business positively liberia petroleum refining company the lowdown the primary statutory obligation of the liberia petroleum refinery company lprc is to ensure adequate and consistent supply of petroleum products on the liberian market effectuating this task has always generated mixed reactions from the public whether from owners or users of vehicles manufacturers or consumers the prices of petroleum products are inseparable from the factors that drive transportation fares which remain the engine of domestic trade and commerce in liberia in 2019 the year under review the prices of petroleum products fluctuated month by month and when there were apparent shortages retailers were accused of holding thereby causing hike in the prices while the lprc and other relevant government ministries and agency were condemned for not enforcing appropriate measures to avert fuel shortage and its ramifications meanwhile during the year under review the lprc experienced the appointment of two managing directors respectively first it was ms nyemadi d pearson steering the wheel at the lprc and by june president george weah opted for ms marie urey coleman as pearson s successor 2019 highs although the lprc faced some public backlashes for its periodic shortage of petroleum on the market thereby causing price hike they had insistently argued that importation of petro was delayed by vessels transporting the products to the country there were also reductions in the prices of petroleum products gasoline was reduced by fifteen 0 15 united states cents while there was an increase of ten 0 10 united states cents in the pump prices of diesel fuel ago on the liberian market the lprc also completed the product storage terminal pst rehabilitation expansion project and the new operation building in 2019 experts at the time who toured the facilities described them as a pre defined quality assurance standard which meets best international standard the operation building now has several offices while the pst has an increased volumetric capacity of from 61 431mt to 91 422 mt representing 33 in addition to a new bitumen storage tank with a capacity of 10 000 mt also a rehabilitation and expansion project of the tecxico tank farm will be increased from 61 431mt to 91 422 mt representing 33 or 91 422mt a 10 000 mt capacity bitumen storage tank the lprc disclosed in the year under review 2019 lows sporadic shortage or lack of petroleum on the market at certain time of the year made the lprc unpopular amongst commercial motorists and passengers alike local businesses struggled to keep their generators on while prices of basic commodities in rural liberia were doubled because transportation had also doubled or tripled also during the year mr ben sanvee s resignation as member of the board brought the lprc under public scrutiny sanvee following his resignation appeared on the costa show to lambast the running of the lprc he asserted that the lprc needed a complete overhaul and later during the year the house of representatives on thursday june 20 2019 during the 40th day sitting expressed their disappointments and frustration because major petroleum dealers had refused to pay road fund levies that was after the companies had agreed to withdraw their case from the court the delays by petroleum importers to pay road fund levy landed the management in hot water with the lawmakers representatives clarence massaquoi joseph somwarbi edward karfiah ben fofana matthew zarzar and nathaniel barway publically voiced their unhappiness and resentments over the unwanted delay and said the lprc was partially reasonable for the delays grade d 2020 outlook with the stability in the price of gasoline at the end of the year the lprc is expected to stay the course and ensure importers and retailers are checkmated there will also be scrutiny about the lprc role in the collection of fuel levy for the national road fund which is intended for the maintenance of roads and bridges in the country national housing authority nha the lowdown the national housing authority nha was one of those liberian government s agencies that were always in the news they had some kind of activities either negative or positive in almost all of the last 12 months of 2019 2019 lows the nha year began in january with the first judicial circuit criminal court c at the temple of justice issuing a writ of arrest for their former bosses including duannah siryon for their alleged involvement with the bribery scandal according to the writ siryon tugbeh c tugbeh nha isaac roberts nha augustine weah executive director of guss group of companies and emmanuel tapsoda gelpaz immo representative were indicted for the crimes of economic sabotage theft of property bribery misapplication of entrusted property and criminal conspiracy the grand jury for montserrado county republic of liberia upon their oath do hereby find more probably than not that the defendants duannah siryon tugbeh c tugbeh isaac roberts and augustine weah to be identified committed the crime of economic sabotage a felony of the first degree excerpt of the indictment read based on the writ it appeared damning for the nha which had begun on a somewhat good note at the inception of the george weah lead regime in 2018 few months further into the year the very same burkinabe construction company that siryon and others had been accused of receiving bribes from to favor was again presented with a contract for the construction of housing units by the new nha team which had taken over from the siryon led team at the nha this was a somewhat redux of the infamous sable mining exposé the gelpaz national housing authority corruption saga that saw siryon his principal deputies and officials of gelpaz land in jail for alleged bribery and solicitation of bribes took another trend despite the case being in court for alleged bribery gelpaz and the national housing authority nha signed a memorandum of understanding in october 2018 for the construction of 50 000 low cost housing units throughout the 15 counties of liberia however things went amiss between the nha and the burkina faso based real estate developer after a leaked secret recording alleging some big shots in government requested bribes as compensation for the consummation of the contract was exposed by frontpageafrica pictures of the contract signing were posted to facebook on july 10 2019 by madam celia cuffy brown who was appointed two weeks earlier by the president as the new managing director of the nha sources closed to the developments at the nha had informed this newspaper that ms cuffy brown would have issued a press statement to announce the signing of the contract which she regarded as a big achievement for the short period of time she has headed the housing authority frontpageafrica was informed that the consummation of the contract was pushed by the minister of state nathaniel mcgill it was the same mcgill s name which was mentioned in the leaked audio to have made financial demands to the company for the signing of the contract in the audio which was published by this newspaper in november 2018 the former representative of gelpaz in liberia augustine weah who is also the vice president of the company alleged that nha managing director mr duanah siryon had requested kickback in the tone of us 160 000 for nha us 100 000 for justice minister us 100 000 for nathaniel mcgill and us 100 000 for finance minister before the contract can be consummated according to weah he negotiated with siryon that they gelpaz did not have that amount of money on hand but had made some transfer via lbdi bank and could produce us 80 000 to be split between minister mcgill his team and the nha after that the us 80 000 was presented to duanah siryon and he told me i ll give you us 20 000 to keep and i ll take the us 60 000 to mcgill to disburse weah was heard saying on the leaked audio weah further alleged that the nha managing director requested and was offered a percentage in the construction but pleaded that such should be kept secret from his principal deputies the case dragged on throughout the year in the court until november when the criminal court c judge blamo dixon handed down on friday november 8 2019 his ruling acquitting siryon and all others from nha of all charges brought against them by the state the men had been indicted on december 14 2018 whether or not the prosecution proved its case beyond all reasonable the answer is no the prosecution willfully failed to establish its prima facie against the defendants in the absence of augustine weah and emmanuel taosoba officials of the burkinabe firm who allegedly brought the money there is no evidence at all to convict the defendants there is no proven evidence because emmanuel taosoba and augustine weah defendants escaped the bailiwick of the republic of liberia judge blamo had said when he ruled as the case was ongoing in october 2019 officers of the liberia national police flew in full swing to disperse a group of nha workers who had gathered to protest for 11 month salaries which had not been paid them the disenchanted employees of the housing authority had gathered in front the ministry of foreign affairs to protest the police arrested three of the peaceful protesters who were seen holding placard the three persons arrested according to their spokesman were taken into police custody the protesters then relocated to the ministry of education on third street sinkor and continued their protest the nha aggrieved staffs held placards bearing inscriptions like our children need to go to school we need to take care of our families we have waited for too long dixon n nebo spokesperson of the protesters told frontpageafrica that their concerns had been ignored on many occasions today is a sad day in liberia and the national housing authority workers are still in the street because we have tried all efforts used all the diplomatic means and our plights have not been adhered to and the best thing is to draw government attention nebo said they and many other public agencies are still dogged by this salary delay situation 2019 highs nevertheless there were many high moments too in the year authorities at the nha always had these highs in the form of letting the public know that they were entering new agreements with construction companies for the building of low cost housing units in parts of the country at least news of sort from the nha appeared in january february march may july august september and october of the year under review grade d 2020 outlook the year coming is going to be among the crucial years ahead for the national housing authority nearly all of that good news of agreements being signed between the nha and those construction companies are yet to be seen coming to fruition hopefully those projects might be jump started in 2020 the environmental protection agency the lowdown the environmental protection agency epa is the regulatory institution of the government of liberia for the sustainable management of the environment and its natural resources the agency was established by an act of the legislature november 26 2002 and published into hand bill on april 30 2003 the act creating the agency provides the legal mandates and authority to manage coordinate monitor and supervise in consultation with relevant line ministries agencies and organization and other relevant stakeholders for the protection of the environment and sustainable use of natural resources the act details the functions of the epa from the policy council to environmental inspectors the act also clearly explain the entire environmental impact assessment eia process in its totality 2019 highs the epa has been in the limelight this year at the just ended united nations conference on climate change cop 25 in madrid spain epa executive director dr nathaniel t blama sr signed an mou for the establishment of ecovillages in liberia the mou was signed with the global ecovillage network gen the deployment of ecovillages in liberia is intended to work with communities that face severe ecological challenges the programme will assist the government in achieving sustainable development goals considering the vulnerable groups such as women and children youth elders and most importantly people with disabilities this project will also bring to reality the ecotourism strategy developed by the forestry development authority fda in september this year the epa launched a rescue mission for west point the largest slum community in monrovia which is gradually sinking under water due to the situation the government has finally asked residents in red zone to evacuate dangerous spots to avoid fatality but the government says it needs us 40 million to secure the entire township from the rising sea levels though the government faces financial constraint epa is soliciting funding to erect coastal defenses in west point on thursday september 5 epa and its partners as well as other stakeholders validated the monrovia metropolitan coastal resilience project mcrp an initiative that would cost over us 28 million that seeks to address the issue of the violent rapid sea erosion taking place at the township of west point the violent waves from the sea which have caused erosion are now a perennial problem for the township that is home to about 75 000 people in august this year more than 75 homes were washed away by the violent sea waves but if the coastal resilience project is completed it will save the township from total collapse over the year the epa has conducted pieces of training for various stakeholders including journalists farmers and civil society organizations on the effects and impact of climate change and the climate actions they can take to avert climate change 2019 lows not much has been visible on the epa s efforts to curtail illegal occupation of swamplands which is leading to the massive destruction of mangroves mangroves protect shorelines from damaging storm and hurricane winds waves and floods mangroves also help prevent erosion by stabilizing sediments with their tangled root systems they maintain water quality and clarity filtering pollutants and trapping sediments originating from land grade c 2020 outlook with 100 people trained in environmental safeguarding it is expected that the epa s robustness would be felt more in the coming year the enforcement of environmental laws throughout the country
many grassroots democrats separated from their party in the 1990s and the 2020 election may be the last chance to save the marriage while the gop has been trying to establish a semi permanent ruling majority through bigotry gerrymandering and voter suppression democrats had long term majority control of american politics pretty much continuously for more than a half century franklin d roosevelt was elected four times to the presidency and brought with him a democratic party sweep so complete that with the exception of two brief two year periods democrats controlled the house of representatives from 1931 to 1995 fdr built the modern day democratic party and launched it toward the 21st century working class americans had fallen in love with roosevelt and democratic party policies in the 1930s and that love affair persisted across the better part of three generations in the past few decades though they fell out of love with the democratic party and began regularly putting republicans in charge of the country what happened back in the 1980s sociologist diane vaughan did some remarkable research about how people fall in and out of love that she compiled in her book uncoupling her surprising but commonsense findings now used by psychotherapists and marriage counselors around the world apply to politics as much as they do to intimate relationships at some point during most relationships one partner will become dissatisfied with the behavior of the other when this dissatisfaction is so fundamental that the unhappy partner might consider dissolving the relationship if it s not changed they will almost always say something or otherwise signal their dissatisfaction this signal of dissatisfaction is referred to by therapists as the cry as in the announcement think town crier not sobbing if the offending partner ignores or doesn t understand the gravity of this cry out about how the relationship is going it s referred to as the cry unheard the most common occurrence is that the partner hears the cry but doesn t think it s a big deal and so ignores it in other cases it s missed altogether when the cry isn t heard or is misunderstood as a routine small disagreement the dissatisfied partner will begin noticing other things that are offending and over time compile a list of reasons to leave the relationship that outnumbers the reasons to stay meanwhile the offending partner not having heard or having misunderstood the cry is oblivious and thinks everything is just fine the first turning point in the relationship comes when the dissatisfied partner having put out the cry unheard and not seeing changes in behavior starts to share the grievance with others complaining often subtly about their partner after a typically relatively short time having gotten feedback from others that yes that behavior would bother me too the dissatisfied partner concluding the relationship can t be salvaged begins an emotional separation process moving past bargaining and anger into grieving the loss accepting that the relationship is not salvageable and then finally announcing that they are pulling the plug on the relationship hearing for the first time this announcement that the relationship is dead the clueless partner who didn t hear the cry is blindsided shocked and devastated while their partner has already gone through all the stages of unhappiness deciding to leave grieving the failure of the relationship and accepting it as over the clueless partner is forced to begin the process similar to kubler ross stages of dying for themselves from a cold start applying this model to the democratic party the first really loud cry unheard from the democratic electorate came in 1992 prior to 1992 the democratic party had been fdr s and lbj s party of big government big projects from legalizing unions to creating social security and medicare to putting a man on the moon and the great defender of working people for example many democrats and their union allies strongly opposed nixon s 1974 trade act ultimately signed by gerald ford that gave fast track authority to the president to encourage offshoring american jobs we ve lost more than 80 000 factories just since then by cutting protective tariffs on imports i was living in michigan running an advertising agency and reporting news part time in the mid 1970s and i remember well how dangerous it was to drive one of the cheap imported mostly japanese cars that began flooding the country that decade as a result of the nixon ford trade policies working people were furious with the job losses and when jimmy carter didn t reverse nixon s trade policies they turned to reagan who had promised in the election of 1980 that he would protect workers jobs even securing the endorsement of patco the air controllers union he would famously betray in his first year in office while union leaders were wary and opposed reagan many rank and file members believed the charismatic actor but instead of standing up for working people in 1981 reagan declared war on the unions then the largest funders of the democratic party nationwide and began negotiations with mexico and canada to speed up the rate at which american companies were moving factories and thus union jobs out of the u s this picked up steam with the nafta agreement itself which was finalized by the george h w bush administration in 1992 although it was yet to be ratified by congress in 1971 when walmart was a regional retailer operating in only five states its stores often had banners proclaiming what became the title of sam walton s autobiography made in america by the election year of 1992 four years after sam had stepped down as ceo it was getting hard to find anything in a walmart that was still made in the usa and it wasn t just walmart the 1970s trickle of foreign cars had become a flood by the end of the reagan and bush years in 1992 and union jobs all across america were vanishing along with the factories that provided for them thus the cry unheard of america s working people most of them democrats back then even if they d had an affair with reagan was please stop these insane free trade deals that nixon started and reagan bush put on steroids but by this time the leadership of the democratic party wasn t listening or dismissed union concerns as something that would pass as reagan planned union jobs evaporated throughout the 1980s and with them went the ability of big unions to support democratic politicians with either cash or boots on the ground with the unions dying under reagan s assault bill clinton planning to run for president in the election of 1992 knew he had to find other sources of financial support the supreme court had opened the floodgates to corporate money in 1976 and 1978 exploding the cost of a presidential campaign this was before anybody knew how to raise individual contributions on the internet so clinton had to figure out how to finance his campaign without relying on the unions as al from lays out in his book the new democrats and the return to power he and bill clinton worked to rescue the party from the political wilderness redefine its message and most importantly win presidential elections and that would take a lot of cash bank robber willie sutton famously said that banks were where the money is and the money available for politics in 1992 had moved from the pockets of working people wages had been flat for more than a decade and their unions unionization was in freefall into the pockets of banks insurance companies drug companies defense contractors and other big corporations and the supreme court had legalized taking their money in exchange for favors just before reagan s election in 1976 and 1978 and tripled down on it in 2016 in april 1989 from s book notes he traveled to little rock arkansas to recruit the state s young governor bill clinton to be chairman of the dlc the result of their partnership was the creation of the democratic leadership council dlc and a new mantra for the democratic party conomic centrism national security and entitlement reform that brought with it a flood of corporate and billionaire money the party of big government solutions had become the party of big corporate money as a result that first clinton election year 1992 was also the year when the cry unheard of american working people became a primal scream nearly one in five voters that year cast a ballot for an eccentric billionaire from texas ross perot whose mantra was that the nafta free trade agreement negotiated by reagan bush but also supported by the newly baptized dlc chair clinton would lead to a giant sucking sound from the south as factories and jobs moved to mexico clinton suggested that blue collar jobs weren t the future of america and his running mate al gore said that moving automotive and other factories to mexico would actually be good for america because mexican workers would no longer have an incentive to cross our southern border and we cut down on illegal immigration the democratic party now led by clinton thus embraced a behavior that most working americans knew would be a disaster for them and that they had cried out loudly against with their perot vote in 1992 over the next eight years as clinton ignored them many began considering having another affair with the gop after all if clinton was going to embrace reagan bush trade policies why not just go right to the source the gop itself for policy prescriptions according to bob woodward during a meeting in the oval office clinton said sarcastically where are all the democrats i hope you re all aware we re all eisenhower republicans he added we re eisenhower republicans here here we are and we re standing for lower deficits and free trade and the bond market isn t that great further turning his back on the fdr lbj democratic party principles clinton went on to heartily embrace republican policies of cutting the social safety net the era of big government is over he proclaimed putting the knife hilt deep into the spine of lbj s great society clinton said today we are ending welfare as we know it as he signed into law the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 that law undid much of lbj s great society legislation which had succeeded in cutting poverty rates in america from 22 2 percent in 1963 down to 12 6 percent in 1970 for the first time since lbj s great society in the 1960s families in poverty were not guaranteed a lifeline they had to prove they were working in order to qualify for assistance which sounded like a good idea in theory especially during boom times like the 90s when there were lots of jobs available but during recessions when three or four people are looking for every one available job a work requirement for welfare does a lot of harm to already struggling families the stats have borne this out in the years after welfare reform as a series of presidents and governors have followed in clinton s footsteps ever more people have been kicked off benefits while poverty has increased before clinton s welfare reform roughly 70 percent of impoverished families had access to a lifeline but after reform by 2016 only 23 percent did and in some states that number was below 10 percent meanwhile the reagan revolution s trade policy was wiping out the industrial base of america while its tax policies were simultaneously moving trillions of dollars in wealth from middle class families into the pockets of the top 1 percent the year reagan was sworn in we were the richest nation in the world and other than a few wobbles during the civil war and two world wars our national debt had been relatively steady in inflation adjusted dollars since the administration of george washington we were the world s largest creditor more countries owed us money than any other nation on earth today after nearly 40 years of neoliberal reaganomics we are the world s largest debtor nation and our national debt nearly outweighs our annual gdp the year reagan was sworn into office the united states was the largest importer of raw materials in the world and the world s largest exporter of finished manufactured goods we brought in ores for manufacturing and shipped out everything from tvs

goods we ve gone from trade surpluses to trade deficits a reflection of the fact that our factory floors had moved to asia and mexico in 1960 about one in four americans worked in manufacturing producing things of lasting wealth for our nation today after jumping headfirst into one free trade agreement after another fewer than one in ten americans work in manufacturing between 2000 and 2017 5 5 million manufacturing jobs have been lost they didn t disappear they just moved to low wage factories in foreign nations ironically republican president eisenhower 1952 1960 knew that americans loved fdr s new deal and continued fdr s trade policies he had after all grown up with them he was born in 1890 and fought world war ii as the supreme allied commander of europe under fdr and led the invasion at normandy he told his brother edgar in a 1954 letter should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history eisenhower added there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or businessman from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid but clinton and the moderate dlc democrats embraced becoming eisenhower republicans even as eisenhower would have repudiated their policies clinton swipes the gop s lyrics read the headline of a 1996 washington post column by e j dionne which opened with this prescient paragraph the good news is that we may elect a republican president this year said republican consultant alex castellanos the bad news is that it may be bill clinton the result was the beginning of the great uncoupling the democratic party experienced in the 1990s with formerly democratic voting working class and poor people going over to the gop a trend we saw continued with trump s election as harry truman once said the people don t want a phony democrat if it s a choice between a genuine republican and a republican in democratic clothing the people will choose the genuine article every time that is they will take a republican before they will a phony democrat as jobs and economic issues became the exclusive provenance of what the media calls far left politicians like sherrod brown and bernie sanders and the leadership of the democratic party stayed with reaganomics working people generally failed to show up in large enough numbers to keep george w bush out of the white house but george w bush didn t repudiate reaganomics so the working class continued to stagnate economically frustrated americans decided to take another try with the democrats this set up senator barack obama who promised hope and change to beat john mccain s steady as she goes approach to the presidency but vague rhetoric aside obama s change was largely a continuation of clinton s eisenhower like corporate and billionaire friendly dlc policies he restored dignity and sanity to the presidency but also pushed hard to expand nafta like outsourcing policies by throwing several years of political capital into the trans pacific partnership tpp which was ultimately as unpopular among a majority of americans as was nafta in 1992 and his support of organized labor was weak at best since 1981 not one american president has seriously challenged the neoliberal basis of reaganomics billionaires and corporations now largely run our politics to the point that average working people s desires are about as likely

steadily for the past four decades four decades earlier of course the democratic party began a course that culminated in bill clinton leading the party to turn its back on fdr and lbj and embrace republican lite economic and trade policies like a partner whose cry was still unheard america s still wounded working class and newly poor voters decided to take another chance with a new republican partner this time a mobbed up new york city real estate hustler and reality tv star who promised to reverse so called free trade and bring those jobs home donald trump had reached back into the old democratic playbook picking up where lbj who maintained protective tariffs and brought us medicare and medicaid without a single republican vote had left off promising to reinstate protectionist trade policies to bring factories back to america he also promised to reinstate lbj s emphasis on the quality of life for working class and poor people through a national health insurance plan that would be better than obama s affordable care act which was floundering after being gutted by the supreme court we re going to have insurance for everybody trump told the washington post there was a philosophy in some circles that if you can t pay for it you don t get it that s not going to happen with us then health and human services secretary tom price added on meet the press that nobody will be worse off financially with the new trumpcare plan trump tweeted that there would be no cuts to medicaid and said that no one will lose coverage and while trump s trade efforts have been ham handed his trade war with china is outside of farming communities still popular in the industrial heartland particularly among current and former union workers his health care plan was a scam making available on obamacare exchanges formerly 90 day now three year emergency bridge plans that could still cancel insurance for preexisting conditions but with the media focused on trump horserace and scandal virtually no americans realize that the plans trump pitched as new and cheaper are so dangerous thus working class whites in the american midwest and south even those not in thrall to trump s pitch to white supremacists are largely staying with him hope springs eternal after all and dies last the democratic party is still locked out of the senate the supreme court and the white house even after two of the past four presidents who served for eight years each were democrats which brings us to how relationships heal and couples reunite and how this could be applied to save the soul and electoral outcomes of the democratic party when the partner who had ignored the cry now hears it there s a very real chance that the relationship can be saved doing so requires two steps both done with a lot of commitment and hard work first change the offensive behavior second remember why you fell in love in the first place and revisit those reasons experiences feelings and activities that first brought you together democrats know how to do both of these things party leadership notwithstanding the democratic party had built a three generation governing majority once in the past all they need do today is reimplement democratic policies from 1933 to 1979 updated for modern times raise taxes on the rich bring our factories home expand the safety net support gi bill style free education and restore union rights the party should know its history after all and should remember how well it was received by the american people like a partner who wants to repair a wounded relationship the democrats must return to core principles and stay faithful to them and we still have the template today the democratic party has two presidential nominees who carry the values and economic policies of fdr and lbj while embracing modern day values of diversity and inclusion in ways neither party dared before this century the congressional progressive caucus is the second largest democratic caucus and the third largest in all of congress if the democratic party follows its base and promotes progressive candidates and policies it has a good chance of pulling america back from the brink of authoritarianism and oligarchy and to restore our moral authority in the world a return to big thinking and big goals like those of fdr and lbj will put democrats on a track to a second multigenerational governing majority if the party uses its convention and superdelegates on a second vote to choose another candidate committed to dlc now third way policies get ready for either

this article was produced by economy for all a project of the independent media institute many grassroots democrats separated from their party in the 1990s and the 2020 election may be the last chance to save the marriage while the gop has been trying to establish a semi permanent ruling majority through bigotry gerrymandering and voter suppression democrats had long term majority control of american politics pretty much continuously for more than a half century franklin d roosevelt was elected four times to the presidency and brought with him a democratic party sweep so complete that with the exception of two brief two year periods democrats controlled the house of representatives from 1931 to 1995 fdr built the modern day democratic party and launched it toward the 21st century working class americans had fallen in love with roosevelt and democratic party policies in the 1930s and that love affair persisted across the better part of three generations in the past few decades though they fell out of love with the democratic party and began regularly putting republicans in charge of the country what happened back in the 1980s sociologist diane vaughan did some remarkable research about how people fall in and out of love that she compiled in her book uncoupling her surprising but commonsense findings now used by psychotherapists and marriage counselors around the world apply to politics as much as they do to intimate relationships at some point during most relationships one partner will become dissatisfied with the behavior of the other when this dissatisfaction is so fundamental that the unhappy partner might consider dissolving the relationship if it s not changed they will almost always say something or otherwise signal their dissatisfaction this signal of dissatisfaction is referred to by therapists as the cry as in the announcement think town crier not sobbing if the offending partner ignores or doesn t understand the gravity of this cry out about how the relationship is going it s referred to as the cry unheard the most common occurrence is that the partner hears the cry but doesn t think it s a big deal and so ignores it in other cases it s missed altogether when the cry isn t heard or is misunderstood as a routine small disagreement the dissatisfied partner will begin noticing other things that are offending and over time compile a list of reasons to leave the relationship that outnumbers the reasons to stay meanwhile the offending partner not having heard or having misunderstood the cry is oblivious and thinks everything is just fine the first turning point in the relationship comes when the dissatisfied partner having put out the cry unheard and not seeing changes in behavior starts to share the grievance with others complaining often subtly about their partner after a typically relatively short time having gotten feedback from others that yes that behavior would bother me too the dissatisfied partner concluding the relationship can t be salvaged begins an emotional separation process moving past bargaining and anger into grieving the loss accepting that the relationship is not salvageable and then finally announcing that they are pulling the plug on the relationship hearing for the first time this announcement that the relationship is dead the clueless partner who didn t hear the cry is blindsided shocked and devastated while their partner has already gone through all the stages of unhappiness deciding to leave grieving the failure of the relationship and accepting it as over the clueless partner is forced to begin the process similar to kubler ross stages of dying for themselves from a cold start applying this model to the democratic party the first really loud cry unheard from the democratic electorate came in 1992 prior to 1992 the democratic party had been fdr s and lbj s party of big government big projects from legalizing unions to creating social security and medicare to putting a man on the moon and the great defender of working people for example many democrats and their union allies strongly opposed nixon s 1974 trade act ultimately signed by gerald ford that gave fast track authority to the president to encourage offshoring american jobs we ve lost more than 80 000 factories just since then by cutting protective tariffs on imports i was living in michigan running an advertising agency and reporting news part time in the mid 1970s and i remember well how dangerous it was to drive one of the cheap imported mostly japanese cars that began flooding the country that decade as a result of the nixon ford trade policies working people were furious with the job losses and when jimmy carter didn t reverse nixon s trade policies they turned to reagan who had promised in the election of 1980 that he would protect workers jobs even securing the endorsement of patco the air controllers union he would famously betray in his first year in office while union leaders were wary and opposed reagan many rank and file members believed the charismatic actor but instead of standing up for working people in 1981 reagan declared war on the unions then the largest funders of the democratic party nationwide and began negotiations with mexico and canada to speed up the rate at which american companies were moving factories and thus union jobs out of the u s this picked up steam with the nafta agreement itself which was finalized by the george h w bush administration in 1992 although it was yet to be ratified by congress in 1971 when walmart was a regional retailer operating in only five states its stores often had banners proclaiming what became the title of sam walton s autobiography made in america by the election year of 1992 four years after sam had stepped down as ceo it was getting hard to find anything in a walmart that was still made in the usa and it wasn t just walmart the 1970s trickle of foreign cars had become a flood by the end of the reagan and bush years in 1992 and union jobs all across america were vanishing along with the factories that provided for them thus the cry unheard of america s working people most of them democrats back then even if they d had an affair with reagan was please stop these insane free trade deals that nixon started and reagan bush put on steroids but by this time the leadership of the democratic party wasn t listening or dismissed union concerns as something that would pass as reagan planned union jobs evaporated throughout the 1980s and with them went the ability of big unions to support democratic politicians with either cash or boots on the ground with the unions dying under reagan s assault bill clinton planning to run for president in the election of 1992 knew he had to find other sources of financial support the supreme court had opened the floodgates to corporate money in 1976 and 1978 exploding the cost of a presidential campaign this was before anybody knew how to raise individual contributions on the internet so clinton had to figure out how to finance his campaign without relying on the unions as al from lays out in his book the new democrats and the return to power he and bill clinton worked to rescue the party from the political wilderness redefine its message and most importantly win presidential elections and that would take a lot of cash bank robber willie sutton famously said that banks were where the money is and the money available for politics in 1992 had moved from the pockets of working people wages had been flat for more than a decade and their unions unionization was in freefall into the pockets of banks insurance companies drug companies defense contractors and other big corporations and the supreme court had legalized taking their money in exchange for favors just before reagan s election in 1976 and 1978 and tripled down on it in 2016 in april 1989 from s book notes he traveled to little rock arkansas to recruit the state s young governor bill clinton to be chairman of the dlc the result of their partnership was the creation of the democratic leadership council dlc and a new mantra for the democratic party conomic centrism national security and entitlement reform that brought with it a flood of corporate and billionaire money the party of big government solutions had become the party of big corporate money as a result that first clinton election year 1992 was also the year when the cry unheard of american working people became a primal scream nearly one in five voters that year cast a ballot for an eccentric billionaire from texas ross perot whose mantra was that the nafta free trade agreement negotiated by reagan bush but also supported by the newly baptized dlc chair clinton would lead to a giant sucking sound from the south as factories and jobs moved to mexico clinton suggested that blue collar jobs weren t the future of america and his running mate al gore said that moving automotive and other factories to mexico would actually be good for america because mexican workers would no longer have an incentive to cross our southern border and we cut down on illegal immigration the democratic party now led by clinton thus embraced a behavior that most working americans knew would be a disaster for them and that they had cried out loudly against with their perot vote in 1992 over the next eight years as clinton ignored them many began considering having another affair with the gop after all if clinton was going to embrace reagan bush trade policies why not just go right to the source the gop itself for policy prescriptions according to bob woodward during a meeting in the oval office clinton said sarcastically where are all the democrats i hope you re all aware we re all eisenhower republicans he added we re eisenhower republicans here here we are and we re standing for lower deficits and free trade and the bond market isn t that great further turning his back on the fdr lbj democratic party principles clinton went on to heartily embrace republican policies of cutting the social safety net the era of big government is over he proclaimed putting the knife hilt deep into the spine of lbj s great society clinton said today we are ending welfare as we know it as he signed into law the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 that law undid much of lbj s great society legislation which had succeeded in cutting poverty rates in america from 22 2 percent in 1963 down to 12 6 percent in 1970 for the first time since lbj s great society in the 1960s families in poverty were not guaranteed a lifeline they had to prove they were working in order to qualify for assistance which sounded like a good idea in theory especially during boom times like the 90s when there were lots of jobs available but during recessions when three or four people are looking for every one available job a work requirement for welfare does a lot of harm to already struggling families the stats have borne this out in the years after welfare reform as a series of presidents and governors have followed in clinton s footsteps ever more people have been kicked off benefits while poverty has increased before clinton s welfare reform roughly 70 percent of impoverished families had access to a lifeline but after reform by 2016 only 23 percent did and in some states that number was below 10 percent meanwhile the reagan revolution s trade policy was wiping out the industrial base of america while its tax policies were simultaneously moving trillions of dollars in wealth from middle class families into the pockets of the top 1 percent the year reagan was sworn in we were the richest nation in the world and other than a few wobbles during the civil war and two world wars our national debt had been relatively steady in inflation adjusted dollars since the administration of george washington we were the world s largest creditor more countries owed us money than any other nation on earth today after nearly 40 years of neoliberal reaganomics we are the world s largest debtor nation and our national debt nearly outweighs our annual gdp the year reagan was sworn into office the united states was the largest importer of raw materials in the world and the world s largest exporter of finished manufactured goods we brought in ores

which had succeeded in cutting poverty rates in america from 22 2 percent in 1963 down to 12 6 percent in 1970 for the first time since lbj s great society in the 1960s families in poverty were not guaranteed a lifeline they had to prove they were working in order to qualify for assistance which sounded like a good idea in theory especially during boom times like the 90s when there were lots of jobs available but during recessions when three or four people are looking for every one available job a work requirement for welfare does a lot of harm to already struggling families the stats have borne this out in the years after welfare reform as a series of presidents and governors have followed in clinton s footsteps ever more people have been kicked off benefits while poverty has increased before clinton s welfare reform roughly 70 percent of impoverished families had access to a lifeline but after reform by 2016 only 23 percent did and in some states that number was below 10 percent meanwhile the reagan revolution s trade policy was wiping out the industrial base of america while its tax policies were simultaneously moving trillions of dollars in wealth from middle class families into the pockets of the top 1 percent the year reagan was sworn in we were the richest nation in the world and other than a few wobbles during the civil war and two world wars our national debt had been relatively steady in inflation adjusted dollars since the administration of george washington we were the world s largest creditor more countries owed us money than any other nation on earth today after nearly 40 years of neoliberal reaganomics we are the world s largest debtor nation and our national debt nearly outweighs our annual gdp the year reagan was sworn into office the united states was the largest importer of raw materials in the world and the world s largest exporter of finished manufactured goods we brought in ores for manufacturing and shipped out everything from tvs and computers to cars and clothing today things are totally reversed we are now the world s mining pit the largest exporter of raw materials and the world s largest importer of finished manufactured goods we ve gone from trade surpluses to trade deficits a reflection of the fact that our factory floors had moved to asia and mexico in 1960 about one in four americans worked in manufacturing producing things of lasting wealth for our nation today after jumping headfirst into one free trade agreement after another fewer than one in ten americans work in manufacturing between 2000 and 2017 5 5 million manufacturing jobs have been lost they didn t disappear they just moved to low wage factories in foreign nations ironically republican president eisenhower 1952 1960 knew that americans loved fdr s new deal and continued fdr s trade policies he had after all grown up with them he was born in 1890 and fought world war ii as the supreme allied commander of europe under fdr and led the invasion at normandy he told his brother edgar in a 1954 letter should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history eisenhower added there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are texas oil millionaires and an

lbj while embracing modern day values of diversity and inclusion in ways neither party dared before this century the congressional progressive caucus is the second largest democratic caucus and the third largest in all of congress if the democratic party follows its base and promotes progressive candidates and policies it has a good chance of pulling america back from the brink of authoritarianism and oligarchy and to restore our moral authority in the world a return to big thinking and big goals like those of fdr and lbj will put democrats on a track to a second

many grassroots democrats separated from their party in the 1990s and the 2020 election may be the last chance to save the marriage while the gop has been trying to establish a semi permanent ruling majority through bigotry gerrymandering and voter suppression democrats had long term majority control of american politics pretty much continuously for more than a half century franklin d roosevelt was elected four times to the presidency and brought with him a democratic party sweep so complete that with the exception of two brief two year periods democrats controlled the house of representatives from 1931 to 1995 fdr built the modern day democratic party and launched it toward the 21st century working class americans had fallen in love with roosevelt and democratic party policies in the 1930s and that love affair persisted across the better part of three generations in the past few decades though they fell out of love with the democratic party and began regularly putting republicans in charge of the country what happened back in the 1980s sociologist diane vaughan did some remarkable research about how people fall in and out of love that she compiled in her book uncoupling her surprising but commonsense findings now used by psychotherapists and marriage counselors around the world apply to politics as much as they do to intimate relationships at some point during most relationships one partner will become dissatisfied with the behavior of the other when this dissatisfaction is so fundamental that the unhappy partner might consider dissolving the relationship if it s not changed they will almost always say something or otherwise signal their dissatisfaction this signal of dissatisfaction is referred to by therapists as the cry as in the announcement think town crier not sobbing if the offending partner ignores or doesn t understand the gravity of this cry out about how the relationship is going it s referred to as the cry unheard the most common occurrence is that the partner hears the cry but doesn t think it s a big deal and so ignores it in other cases it s missed altogether when the cry isn t heard or is misunderstood as a routine small disagreement the dissatisfied partner will begin noticing other things that are offending and over time compile a list of reasons to leave the relationship that outnumbers the reasons to stay meanwhile the offending partner not having heard or having misunderstood the cry is oblivious and thinks everything is just fine the first turning point in the relationship comes when the dissatisfied partner having put out the cry unheard and not seeing changes in behavior starts to share the grievance with others complaining often subtly about their partner after a typically relatively short time having gotten feedback from others that yes that behavior would bother me too the dissatisfied partner concluding the relationship can t be salvaged begins an emotional separation process moving past bargaining and anger into grieving the loss accepting that the relationship is not salvageable and then finally announcing that they are pulling the plug on the relationship hearing for the first time this announcement that the relationship is dead the clueless partner who didn t hear the cry is blindsided shocked and devastated while their partner has already gone through all the stages of unhappiness deciding to leave grieving the failure of the relationship and accepting it as over the clueless partner is forced to begin the process similar to kubler ross stages of dying for themselves from a cold start applying this model to the democratic party the first really loud cry unheard from the democratic electorate came in 1992 prior to 1992 the democratic party had been fdr s and lbj s party of big government big projects from legalizing unions to creating social security and medicare to putting a man on the moon and the great defender of working people for example many democrats and their union allies strongly opposed nixon s 1974 trade act ultimately signed by gerald ford that gave fast track authority to the president to encourage offshoring american jobs we ve lost more than 80 000 factories just since then by cutting protective tariffs on imports i was living in michigan running an advertising agency and reporting news part time in the mid 1970s and i remember well how dangerous it was to drive one of the cheap imported mostly japanese cars that began flooding the country that decade as a result of the nixon ford trade policies working people were furious with the job losses and when jimmy carter didn t reverse nixon s trade policies they turned to reagan who had promised in the election of 1980 that he would protect workers jobs even securing the endorsement of patco the air controllers union he would famously betray in his first year in office while union leaders were wary and opposed reagan many rank and file members believed the charismatic actor but instead of standing up for working people in 1981 reagan declared war on the unions then the largest funders of the democratic party nationwide and began negotiations with mexico and canada to speed up the rate at which american companies were moving factories and thus union jobs out of the u s this picked up steam with the nafta agreement itself which was finalized by the george h w bush administration in 1992 although it was yet to be ratified by congress in 1971 when walmart was a regional retailer operating in only five states its stores often had banners proclaiming what became the title of sam walton s autobiography made in america by the election year of 1992 four years after sam had stepped down as ceo it was getting hard to find anything in a walmart that was still made in the usa and it wasn t just walmart the 1970s trickle of foreign cars had become a flood by the end of the reagan and bush years in 1992 and union jobs all across america were vanishing along with the factories that provided for them thus the cry unheard of america s working people most of them democrats back then even if they d had an affair with reagan was please stop these insane free trade deals that nixon started and reagan bush put on steroids but by this time the leadership of the democratic party wasn t listening or dismissed union concerns as something that would pass as reagan planned union jobs evaporated throughout the 1980s and with them went the ability of big unions to support democratic politicians with either cash or boots on the ground with the unions dying under reagan s assault bill clinton planning to run for president in the election of 1992 knew he had to find other sources of financial support the supreme court had opened the floodgates to corporate money in 1976 and 1978 exploding the cost of a presidential campaign this was before anybody knew how to raise individual contributions on the internet so clinton had to figure out how to finance his campaign without relying on the unions as al from lays out in his book the new democrats and the return to power he and bill clinton worked to rescue the party from the political wilderness redefine its message and most importantly win presidential elections and that would take a lot of cash bank robber willie sutton famously said that banks were where the money is and the money available for politics in 1992 had moved from the pockets of working people wages had been flat for more than a decade and their unions unionization was in freefall into the pockets of banks insurance companies drug companies defense contractors and other big corporations and the supreme court had legalized taking their money in exchange for favors just before reagan s election in 1976 and 1978 and tripled down on it in 2016 in april 1989 from s book notes he traveled to little rock arkansas to recruit the state s young governor bill clinton to be chairman of the dlc the result of their partnership was the creation of the democratic leadership council dlc and a new mantra for the democratic party conomic centrism national security and entitlement reform that brought with it a flood of corporate and billionaire money the party of big government solutions had become the party of big corporate money as a result that first clinton election year 1992 was also the year when the cry unheard of american working people became a primal scream nearly one in five voters that year cast a ballot for an eccentric billionaire from texas ross perot whose mantra was that the nafta free trade agreement negotiated by reagan bush but also supported by the newly baptized dlc chair clinton would lead to a giant sucking sound from the south as factories and jobs moved to mexico clinton suggested that blue collar jobs weren t the future of america and his running mate al gore said that moving automotive and other factories to mexico would actually be good for america because mexican workers would no longer have an incentive to cross our southern border and we cut down on illegal immigration the democratic party now led by clinton thus embraced a behavior that most working americans knew would be a disaster for them and that they had cried out loudly against with their perot vote in 1992 over the next eight years as clinton ignored them many began considering having another affair with the gop after all if clinton was going to embrace reagan bush trade policies why not just go right to the source the gop itself for policy prescriptions according to bob woodward during a meeting in the oval office clinton said sarcastically where are all the democrats i hope you re all aware we re all eisenhower republicans he added we re eisenhower republicans here here we are and we re standing for lower deficits and free trade and the bond market isn t that great further turning his back on the fdr lbj democratic party principles clinton went on to heartily embrace republican policies of cutting the social safety net the era of big government is over he proclaimed putting the knife hilt deep into the spine of lbj s great society clinton

this would provide a foundation for a long term u s relationship with constituencies in pakistan s urban centers who have been negatively impacted by china s unfair trade practices but may be courted by beijing through the next stage of china pakistan economic corridor last month alice wells the top u s diplomat for south asia delivered a scathing critique of the china pakistan economic corridor cpec the connectivity program valued at upwards of 62 billion linked to china s belt and road initiative or bri what wells offered was a polemic that presented two competing approaches to foreign aid and investment focusing on what china has gotten wrong and what america has gotten right wells rightly noted that cpec with its controlled bidding processes and unclear contractual terms falls short of offering the sustainability and transparency critical for developing countries like pakistan to grow over the long term and she correctly asserted that cpec is not an exercise in chinese philanthropy given that infrastructure projects are mainly funded by loans and chinese companies are earning handsome guaranteed profits by selling comparatively expensive electricity to the pakistani grid america wells claimed provides an alternative development partnership model pairing grant assistance with support for policy reforms aimed at attracting private sector investment but that is only half of the story the u s civilian aid program in pakistan is actually far from a success and china is attempting to make corrections to its economic partnership with pakistan that could position itself as an alternative to the western aid model as the u s development assistance portfolio in pakistan shrinks washington risks losing influence in a strategic region if it continues to offer mere words in response to cpec the most effective way america can offer an alternative to cpec is not by offering more aid but through expanding trade with an emphasis on pakistan s textiles and apparel industry america s aid industrial complex has a mixed record in pakistan since 2009 the united states has given over 4 billion in economic and development assistance to pakistan through the enhanced partnership with pakistan act or eppa the program has resulted in some shared u s pakistan achievements for example the united states agency for international development or usaid facilitated the construction of energy starved pakistan s first liquified natural gas terminal and supply procurement contracts also pakistani mango exports have grown from 28 million in 2011 to 73 million in 2018 or 160 percent thanks in part to usaid assistance in developing a mango processing and logistics infrastructure that allows for pakistani farmers to comply with export market regulations unfortunately the eppa s successes are outweighed by its failures usaid s own office of the inspector general oig assessed in 2016 that roughly 30 percent of the eppa awards funded did not meet intended goals and 55 percent only met them partially more broadly the oig report states that the program also suffered from a conflict between the state department s security driven shorter term priorities including stabilizing conflict hit areas distant from industrial centers rather than usaid s long term objectives focusing on economic growth education and health not only is the american model not the success that wells makes it out to be but it also bears similarity in some ways to the chinese approach both cpec and eppa ostensibly adhere to the recipient government s long term economic plans but in practice they have been project oriented and contractor driven disproportionately benefitting donor country surrogates including chinese state owned enterprises and for profit american development companies as well as pakistani rent seekers nadeem ul haque a former top official with pakistan s main economic planning body has correctly described usaid as an aid outsourcing agency u s companies like chemonics and john snow inc each receive hundreds of millions of dollars a year from usaid and have been among the major recipients of eppa funds with the disparate nature of eppa inflows and considerable outflows the end result is this despite the billions spent eppa did not meaningfully catalyze economic growth in pakistan from 2009 to 2013 the pakistani economy grew at an average annual rate of three percent to be fair fueling growth was not the singular goal of eppa and pakistan during these years was hit with a perfect storm an unprecedented wave of terror epic floods and crippling energy shortages and ultimately it is the pakistani elite that bears responsibility for why their country has failed to develop the human capital governance system and regulatory environment that are requisites for sustainable growth but as i will explain later washington opted for a massive aid program for pakistan when focused trade concessions paired with a more modest aid portfolio could have been far more effective in transforming the pakistani economy china is a lender not a development partner for now as it stands cpec also offers no recipe for fueling long term sustainable growth from 2014 2018 as billions in cpec funds flooded into pakistan and security improved the country s economy grew at an average rate of 5 2 percent this period of expansion however was short lived after peaking at 5 7 percent in 2017 pakistan is now stuck in stagflation with growth below 3 percent and inflation in the double digits rather than transforming the pakistani economy cpec deepened its structural imbalances contributing to a boom driven by household consumption and government spending as pakistani exports declined facing a balance of payments crisis pakistan last year went to the international monetary fund for its twenty second bailout but despite its flaws cpec has produced tangible results over 12 billion in projects have been completed including seven thousand megawatts mw of installed electric power and large upgrades to pakistan s national highway network but the china pakistan economic relationship is far from the win win beijing claims it to be since the china pakistan free trade agreement fta took effect in 2006 islamabad s trade deficit with beijing excluding hong kong has grown by over 500 percent according to pakistani official data pakistan s exports to china grew from 506 million in 2006 to 1 8 billion in 2018 but its imports from china surged from 2 9 billion to 15 3 billion over the same period as with many other countries pakistan s free trade agreement with china has had a devastating impact on its domestic small and medium enterprises beijing and islamabad have a strategic partnership but the chinese remain cutthroat competitors in trade however as cpec heads into its second stage there is potential for china pakistan trade dynamics to change perhaps even fundamentally in response to pakistan s economic crisis and complaints about the trade imbalance from pakistan s business community china has made concessions that could reduce its trade surplus with pakistan earlier this year beijing provided islamabad with 1 billion in temporary trade concessions and this month the second phase of the china pakistan free trade agreement came into effect with 313 tariff lines from pakistan such as textile goods and meat products receiving zero duty status next year chinese companies could also begin to invest in cpec special economic zones or sezs as well as pakistan s extractive industries there are reasons to be skeptical that these measures will achieve their desired results but sustained diversified foreign direct investment in pakistan and growth exports are essential to pakistan s economic rehabilitation china has the potential to be the economic partner that gets pakistan on that path and so does america why exports matter for pakistan pakistan s export weakness goes beyond its trade relationship with china the country s stagnant exports are arguably the biggest missing piece of its growth puzzle and why its economy heats up well before reaching double digit rates of growth when it comes to exports pakistan is a laggard compared to its peers in south asia in 2018 exports made up 8 5 percent of pakistan s gross domestic product or gdp compared to 14 8 percent for bangladesh and 19 7 percent for india the bangladeshi economy now the fastest growing in south asia has been catapulted by apparel exports the apparel sector makes up roughly 80 percent of bangladesh s exports which have surged past pakistan s since 2014 growing by almost 8 billion since then despite the fact that pakistan s textile industry is vertically integrated and bangladesh is a net importer of raw material and fabric bangladesh has had a singular focus on value added apparel exports leveraging its domestic gas reserves and low wages to attract fdi in its export processing zones it is just the latest country whose experience demonstrates how the textiles and apparel sector can drive growth and fuel rising incomes in emerging markets textiles and apparel are also pakistan s largest exports and the united states is pakistan s biggest single country export destination expanding the pakistani textile and apparel industry s access to the u s market would be the among most effective ways to fuel economic growth in pakistan it seems like common sense that a u s strategy for catalyzing aggregate growth in a country population of two hundred million would prioritize the mass production of goods instead of a dizzying array of programs including training low volume handicrafts artisans america has an opportunity to address pakistan s export challenge given that the textile and apparel industry runs on low margins tariffs are an important factor impacting competitiveness jordan for example imports energy labor and raw materials and even labor but it has emerged as a major apparel exporter to the united states as a result of their bilateral fta though pakistan has a preferential trade relationship with the united states through the generalized system of preferences or gsp pakistan s main textile and apparel products are not zero rated they are hit with double digit tariffs as is the case with most gsp beneficiaries

trade figures were mixed exports fell less than expected 7 9 but are still the third worse of the year japanese exports have fallen on a year over year basis since last november in october exports were off 9 2 the most in the cycle however the greater surprise was on imports rather than improve they contracted by 15 7 after a 14 8 decline in october the fall in imports appears to reflect the weak domestic economy and soft demand for durable goods like autos and cell phones on a seasonally adjusted basis it was the ninth consecutive month of trade deficit a positive note from today s figure is that net exports may not be a drag on q4 gdp which is being depressed by the sales tax increase and the tsunami that hit in october the dollar is in less than a 20 pip range against the

for the past three months the bank of england meets tomorrow and is widely expected to hold policy steady even though two members of the mpc dissented last month ostensibly the lifting of uncertainty around brexit and the fiscal promises made during the campaign will likely keep the boe s hand steady at carney s second to the last meeting as governor sp changed the outlook for the uk credit to stable from negative while it acknowledged that a no deal exit is still possible it anticipates despite the government s move to block it that it will eventually request an extension of the transition period separately fitch took the uk off its negative credit watch but maintained a negative outlook both rating agencies rate the uk aa moody s has the equivalent rating and also has a negative outlook the euro s upside momentum stalled ahead of last weekend near 1 12 recall that it began the month a little above 1 10 the risk is that some of the late longs cut and run and push the euro to 1

central bank incentive not to join many other countries that have eased monetary policy the calculus would change if there were to be a serious deterioration in the labor market mexico s central bank

i n his classic book asian drama an inquiry into the poverty of nations 1968 the economist and nobel prize winner gunnar myrdal expressed concern about the rapid fall of asia in the world economy in the past 150 years he was pessimistic about asia s growth prospects deepak nayyar an eminent economist administrator and policymaker shows in his latest book resurgent asia diversity in development that myrdal s pessimism turned out to be wrong nayyar provides an analytical narrative of the economic development of asia in the past 50 years in historical perspective and an economic analysis of the underlying factors with a focus on critical issues in the process of and outcomes of development page 4 his perspective is asian his analysis is broader in geographical coverage than myrdal s he disaggregates asia into its four constituent subregions east asia south east asia south asia and west asia central asia is omitted because countries in this subregion were part of the erstwhile soviet union for half of the 50 year study period west asia is not covered in depth because its countries are natural resource based economies and hence different from the rest of asia for understanding the diversity in development he considers 14 asian countries china south korea and taiwan in east asia indonesia malaysia the philippines singapore thailand and vietnam in south east asia bangladesh india pakistan and sri lanka in south asia and turkey in west asia the data for the 14 countries cover the period between 1971 and 2016 in chapter 2 the author provides a historical perspective on the decline and fall of asia in the world economy from 1820 to 1962 asia s share in the world population declined from 65 2 per cent to 52 2 per cent its share in the world gross domestic product gdp fell from 56 5 per cent to 14 9 per cent while that of the west increased from 36 9 per cent to 73 4 per cent in this period nayyar attributes the decline and fall of asia to its integration with the world economy through trade and investment shaped by colonialism and driven by imperialism page 38 the social and economic transformation in asia between 1965 and 2016 is impressive the population increased by 142 per cent birth rate per 1 000 fell from 40 to 17 life expectancy increased from 49 years to 72 years and infant mortality per 1 000 live births fell from 160 to 23 the gdp per capita in constant 2010 us increased from 714 to 4 898 the share of the primary sector in the gdp fell from 27 4 per cent to 8 per cent gross capital formation as a percentage of gdp increased from 21 6 per cent to 37 6 per cent during 1971 2016 the gdp growth rate in asia was 5 8 per cent compared with the world gdp growth rate of 2 96 per cent the inward flows of foreign direct investment fdi as a percentage of the world inflows increased from 13 per cent in 1981 90 to 28 9 per cent over the 2011 15 period the macroeconomics of asia 14 countries growth in the 1971 2016 period is analysed in terms of indicators such as gdp growth rate investment rate savings rate employment creation gross fiscal balance current account balance and inflation rate china recorded the highest annual growth rate of 9 14 per cent followed by south korea at 6 85 singapore 6 69 and taiwan 6 42 india achieved a growth rate of 5 73 per cent as for investment as a percentage of gdp in 2015 china had 45 2 indonesia 34 4 and india 32 7 pakistan had the lowest 15 1 per cent gross domestic savings as a percentage of gdp in 2011 15 was 53 6 in singapore 49 3 in china 32 0 in india and 8 4 in pakistan on the demand side the study finds private consumption expenditure as an important stimulus for economic growth the rate of employment creation per annum was lower in the 1991 2016 period than in 1971 90 macroeconomic balances are reported in terms of indicators such as gross fiscal balance and current account balance as a percentage of gdp and inflation rate in per cent per annum in 2015 all countries except south korea and singapore reported gross negative fiscal balance the current account balance was positive for the three east asian countries and malaysia the philippines singapore thailand vietnam and bangladesh it was negative for the other five countries the inflation rate was high in india and pakistan and was the lowest in taiwan nayyar says that many of the asia 14 countries did not follow orthodox prescriptions of balanced budgets and price stability for macroeconomic management structural changes structural changes during economic transformation are analysed in terms of shares of primary secondary and tertiary sectors in output and employment these changes do occur because income elasticities of demand for these sectors differ less than one for agriculture and above one for industry and services in china the share of the primary sector in the composition of output fell from 35 1 per cent in 1970 to 8 9 per cent in 2016 in the case of south korea the fall was from 28 9 per cent to 2 2 per cent for india the fall was from 44 per cent to 17 4 per cent for pakistan the share was 25 2 per cent in 2016 as for the secondary sector only in china and malaysia the share was 40 per cent or more the share of the tertiary sector in 2016 was above 50 per cent in all countries except indonesia and vietnam in terms of employment the share of the primary sector fell in all the 14 countries in 2016 it was above 40 per cent in bangladesh india pakistan and vietnam the share of the secondary sector in employment in 2016 varied from 16 3 per cent in singapore to 35 9 per cent in taiwan the process of structural transformation is seen in the migration of the rural population to urban areas international trade in goods and services and flows of fdi are viewed as the most visible forms of economic openness merchandise exports as a percentage of gdp were high for malaysia and singapore even in 1970 in the case of china it increased from 2 6 in 1970 to 31 1 in 2008 and fell to 18 7 in 2016 for india it increased from 3 4 in 1970 to 15 5 and fell to 11 7 in 2016 exports of services as a percentage of gdp for asia 14 increased from 2 2 in 1980 to 5 0 in 2013 the share of services in 2013 was the highest for singapore at 40 5 per cent fdi flows the annual flows of fdi as a percentage of gross domestic capital formation in asia 14 increased from 2 1 in 1981 90 to 7 4 in 2001 08 and fell to 4 6 in 2009 16 in 2009 16 it was 73 8 in singapore manufacturing value added mva as a percentage of gdp is considered an important outcome of industrialisation for asia 14 the mva increased from 9 8 in 1970 to 26 3 in 2010 and fell to 24 3 in 2016 it was above 25 per cent in east asian countries between 14 and 27 per cent in south east asian countries and between 12 and 17 per cent in south asian countries nayyar states that openness while necessary is not sufficient for rapid development it was conducive to industrialisation only when combined with industrial policy page 152 the success stories of south korea taiwan singapore china and vietnam in industrialisation illustrate how firms could realise economies of scale vertical diversification and technological upgradation through government intervention according to him india lagged behind the leaders because india s industrial policy was poorly implemented or was not simply used page 152 nayyar delineates the economic and political roles of the state in the process of economic development in many asian countries governments performed a crucial role ranging from leader to catalyst or supporter he argues that the state and the markets complement each other and their respective roles differed from country to country and changed over time the developmental states of south korea taiwan and singapore coordinated policies across sectors using the carrot and stick approach china emulated these developmental states in a different political context india followed centralised planning until 1990 and started the process of liberalisation the experiences of the other asia 14 countries also differ the distribution of gdp among the regions became more unequal during the 50 year period the share of east asia rose from less than two fifths to three fifths the share of south asia fell from three tenths to one eighth while the share of south east asia remained unchanged income inequality inequality in income distribution is measured using the gini coefficient a value of zero implying perfect equality and a value of 100 implying perfect inequality the gini coefficient for china increased from 27 9 in 1970 to 46 2 in 2015 implying increase in inequality in the case of south korea taiwan indonesia and thailand there were small changes inequality is decreasing in malaysia the philippines and thailand but increasing in singapore in south asia inequality is increasing in bangladesh india and sri lanka in pakistan there is no trend the percentage of poor having income below the purchasing power parity of 1 90 a day in china fell dramatically from 75 8 in 1984 to 6 5 in 2012 the percentage declined in all the countries in india it was 21 2 per cent in 2012 the highest among the asia 14 countries well being is analysed in terms of three indicators infant mortality rate life expectancy at birth and adult literacy rate between 1970 and 2016 infant mortality fell below 10 per 1 000 live births in china south korea taiwan malaysia singapore thailand and sri lanka it was high for india at 34 and pakistan at 63 life expectancy has increased in all these countries the adult literacy rate has also improved in all these countries it is above 90 per cent in east asian and south east asian countries and was relatively low in 2016 in bangladesh 73 india 69 and pakistan 57 in the 1970 2016 period asia s economic significance in the world economy as a percentage of the world gdp is seen in a rise in the gdp from 8 7 to 29 9 b increase in mva from 3 6 to 40 8 c growth in merchandise exports from 8 4 to 36 and d increase in foreign exchange reserves from 11 2 to 53 9 nayyar considers the negative and positive effects of the rise of asia on the global economy the negative effects might arise because a the burgeoning demand in china and india could drive up the prices of primary commodities and rising real wages in asia could drive up the prices of labour intensive manufactured goods in the world market both could turn the terms of trade against industrialised countries b for the industrialised countries asian countries could emerge as potential locations to compete for investment c the economic rise of asia may lead to downward pressure on employment levels and real wages in the industrialised countries page 213 the positive impacts are a expanding markets for exports from industrialised countries b reduced inflationary pressures in industrialised countries owing to imports of cheap manufactured goods and c asia as a new source of technologies such as mobile phones and solar panels page 214 nayyar raises the following question what does transformed asia imply for international institutions multilateral rules and global governance western countries created the international monetary fund and the world bank after the second world war with minor roles for developing countries in management in the united nations security council only china is a permanent member from among the developing countries the world trade organisation wto was established in 1995 it is democratic and rule based but the position of developing countries in trade negotiations and bargaining appears to be weak the failure of the doha round is a recent example now developing countries fear that they may lose the special and differential treatment provision in the wto environment resurgent asia does not address environmental issues although it recognises the problem page 232 in 2015 u n member states adopted 17 sustainable development goals sdgs as a universal call to end poverty to protect the planet and to ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030 most sdgs are in the nature of global public goods via global public choice sustainable development has three pillars economic social and environmental past economic policies focussing only on economic growth resulted in degradation of natural resources according to the environmental performance index based on environmental health and ecosystem vitality indicators prepared by the yale centre for environmental law and policy of the 180 countries covered the ranking of asia 14 ranges from taiwan 23 to bangladesh 179 india s rank is 177 and china s is 120 only six of the asia 14 countries figure below 100 in the ranking principle 7 of the rio declaration on environment and development 1992 notes that in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation states have common but differentiated responsibilities cbdr the u n framework convention on climate change incorporates this rio principle in addressing climate change greenhouse gas accumulation is a global public bad since developed countries are historically responsible for the current level of the stock and as they have the resources and technologies for climate change mitigation they are required to shoulder a large burden in climate change mitigation for this reason developing countries were exempted from greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements under the kyoto protocol in the world conference on environment and development 2012 some developed countries were against the cbdr the paris agreement on climate change in 2015 expects all nations to undertake efforts to combat climate change the united states considers the paris agreement unfair to it and decided to withdraw from it it is a setback to global environmental governance the recent economic slowdown and political backlash resurgent nationalism riding on populist or chauvinist sentiments would result in elimination of concessions and development assistance enjoyed by developing countries particularly asia sustainable development requires resource conservation waste minimisation and planning economic growth subject to ecological limits hence in order to achieve sustainable development asian countries must integrate and balance the three pillars in policy formulation and implementation through the u n wto they must negotiate access to environment friendly technologies from developed countries on affordable terms they must also evolve common positions on multilateral negotiations relating to trade environment technology transfer and global environmental governance nayyar s brilliant analysis based on historical and statistical analysis using the asian perspective enables the reader to understand the socio economic transformation of asia in the past 50 years students of economic development researchers and economic policymakers will find the book an excellent reference material
protesters at an extinction rebellion rally in london photo bu julian meehan flickr global finance capital has seized control of the economies of most nation states the citizens watch helplessly as money and goods are transferred with little regulation across borders they watch as jobs in manufacturing and the professions are shipped to regions of the global south where most workers are paid a dollar or less an hour and receive no benefits they watch as the taxes of the rich and corporations are slashed often to zero they watch as austerity programs dismantle or privatize utilities and basic social services jacking up fees to consumers they watch as chronic unemployment and underemployment devastate workers especially the young they watch as wages stagnate or decline leaving working men and women with unsustainable debts this economic tyranny lies at the root of the unrest in hong kong india chile france iran iraq and lebanon as well as the rise of right wing demagogues and false prophets such as british prime minister boris johnson president donald trump and indian prime minister narendra modi it does not matter whether liberals or conservatives tories or labour republicans or democrats are in power finance capital is impervious to political control the newly defeated labour party in britain by adopting a brexit neutral stance in the election badly misread the zeitgeist yes its leader jeremy corbyn had to contend with hysterical warnings of economic collapse and endured a smear campaign amplified by a media mouthing the accusations of his tory opponents that included claims he was a threat to national security and an anti semite but his and labour s failure to appreciate how desperate workers were for a solution even one growing out of magical thinking about the promise of brexit was a mistake brexit is not a realistic alternative to economic tyranny but it at least offers a hope however unfounded of shattering the bonds of corporate power it posits itself as a weapon in the war between the insiders and the outsiders that this desperate hope by the outsiders is peddled by con artists and charlatans such as johnson and trump is part of the sickness of our age an echo of the economic distortions and right wing populism that saw fascists rise to power in italy and germany in the first part of the 20th century goldman sachs jpmorgan chase citibank exxon mobile walmart apple and amazon are the modern versions of the east india company or la compagnie française de l orient et de la chine these and others among today s global corporations with the assistance of the world bank the world trade organization and the international monetary fund have created unassailable monopolies and effectively hollowed out many nation states both physically and culturally forlorn derelict urban wastelands populated by the bitterly dispossessed are as common in france or britain as they are in america s rust belt governments captive to corporate control have been prostituted to transfer wealth upward swell corporate profits and crush dissent at the expense of democracy the decay and rupture of the social bonds that once held our societies together have unleashed the dark pathologies of opioid alcohol and gambling addictions and led to an explosion of hate crimes and mass shootings along with suicide social control provided by work civic and political participation bonds that integrated us into our communities and gave us a sense of place dignity and agency has been handed over to a heavily militarized police a massive prison system and a judicial system complicit in abolishing basic rights including due process and privacy so to steal a line from vladimir lenin what is to be done can a reformist political candidate a bernie sanders or perhaps an elizabeth warren although i question the authenticity of warren defeat trump and the retrograde forces that empower him or will the u s reformers suffer corbyn s fate in short can the system be reformed from the inside or will we have to take to the streets as the people are doing in chile lebanon france hong kong and elsewhere to demand the overthrow of corporate rule the left even under corbyn is not ready to speak in revolutionary language revolutionary rhetoric within the political system has been adopted by the neofascists and the hard right the brexit debate is about blowing up the system not working within it those who support brexit and johnson will like those who support trump be betrayed but the language employed by johnson and trump is about destruction and this yearning for destruction runs deep among the working class the tragedy is that by backing these demagogues the public is complicit in its own enslavement extinction rebellion which i support is attempting to counter this corporate assault and the consequent ecocide with revolutionary language and sustained civil disobedience designed to make governance impossible i hope extinction rebellion will gain enough popular support to raise a strong barrier before the corporate state starts employing the brute force outlined in operation yellowhammer the six page british government plan that calls for the possible deployment of 50 000 regular and reserved troops and 10 000 riot police to cope with the unrest that might be caused by food and medical shortages following britain s departure from the european union the violent suppression of protesters in france chile iraq iran lebanon india and hong kong is already underway a window into what may be coming to england the united states and other countries that attempt to throw off the yoke of corporate oppression the corporate state loathes the political left but the american political left by agreeing to operate within the constrained and largely rigged electoral system is easily neutered as liberalism was this year in britain and was in 2016 and will be in 2020 in the united states america s democratic party leadership as hostile to its progressive candidates as many in the labour party hierarchy in britain were to corbyn employed a series of measures to prevent sanders from obtaining the nomination in 2016 they included a superdelegates scheme the use of hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate money iron control of the democratic national committee and blocking those registered as independents from voting in democratic primaries politicians such as sanders and corbyn are easily dispatched street art near the marble arch in london england photo by martin hearn but while the corporate state detests political mavericks such as sanders and corbyn it both hates and fears the revolutionary left the revolutionary left speaks an unvarnished truth about corporate power and calls out the entire political ruling class for its complicity it is not interested in accommodation it seeks to disrupt and paralyze the corporate state when many thousands as in hong kong take to the streets shouting slogans like there are no rioters only a tyrannical regime and it was you who taught me that peaceful marches are useless the corporate ruling elites begin to worry this is why populist leaders including eric drouet of the gilets jaunes or yellow vests in france are arrested it is why roger hallam the co founder of extinction rebellion spent six weeks in jail this fall in britain it is why edward leung is serving a six year prison sentence on charges of rioting and assaulting a police officer during the 2016 fishball revolution in hong kong revolutionaries refuse to play by the rules these global revolutionary movements embody a resurrection of the concept of the common good the belief that a society should be structured around caring for all its members especially the most vulnerable they are forces of solidarity even community they understand as the economist karl polanyi wrote that there are two kinds of freedoms there are the bad freedoms to exploit those around us and extract huge profits without regard to the common good and there are the good freedoms freedom of conscience freedom of speech freedom of meeting freedom of association freedom to choose one s job that the bad freedoms destroy the bad freedoms championed by an atomized hyper individualistic consumer culture which kneels before the cult of the self have triumphed the death grip of the ruling elites was illustrated in recent days in madrid where world leaders refused during cop25 the united nations conference on climate change to take meaningful action to halt the climate emergency an existential threat to humankind the bankrupt ideologies of globalization and neoliberalism formulated and used to justify the consolidation of wealth and power as well as the ecocide that is devastating the planet have however lost their credibility neoliberalism the idea that once regulations on corporations and trade barriers are lifted and taxes slashed a society will prosper was always an absurdity none of its promises could be defended by the history and theory of economics concentrating wealth in the hands of a global oligarchic elite eight families now hold as much wealth as 50 percent of the world s population while demolishing government controls and regulations sending production to the global south privatizing public services and destroying labor unions does not distribute wealth allowing global speculators to use money lent to them by the government at virtually zero percent interest to buy back their stock does not distribute wealth permitting corporations to engage in structured asset destruction through inflation to strip assets through mergers and acquisitions to raise the levels of debt incumbency to enforce debt peonage on the public to engage in corporate fraud that includes the dispossession of assets does not distribute wealth the raiding of pension funds credit and stock manipulations and looting the u s treasury when the bubbles and ponzi schemes evaporate does not distribute wealth such actions funnel wealth to those at the top they create enormous income inequality and monopoly power they fuel discontent and political extremism they make the planet uninhabitable for most species they destroy democracy but economic rationality was never the point the point was the restoration of class power neoliberalism transforms freedom for the many into freedom for the few the idiocy of the intellectual gurus who sold us this ideology milton friedman friedrich hayek and ayn rand should have exposed the con from the beginning but they were given ample platforms while their critics the old keynesians were pushed out and silenced freedom became equated with freedom of market forces to do anything the capitalists wanted and that freedom doomed us and looks set to doom the ecosystem on which we depend for life karl marx in volume one of capital explained over a century ago how freedom of the market always results in social inequality the loss of credibility of the reigning ideology has led the ruling elites to forge an alliance with right wing neofascist demagogues such as trump and johnson who employ the tropes of racism islamophobia homophobia bigotry and misogyny to channel the public s growing rage and frustration away from the corporate elites and toward the vulnerable these demagogues accelerate the pillage they accelerate the hatred racism and violence that act as a diversion and they accelerate the social unrest that becomes the excuse for the imposition of tyranny hope lies in the streets millions of

with brent d griffiths the ticker boeing s decision to halt production of its staple 737 max planes is delivering a fresh blow to an already battered manufacturing sector the weakest spot in a slowing u s economy and the ripple effects will be wide enough to take a measurable bite out of economic growth early next year if the aerospace giant can t win regulatory approval to restart production of the plane economic forecasters project the stoppage could cut up to a half point from gdp growth in the first three months of 2020 at a time when its rate already may be dipping below 2 percent worse boeing s skid will compound manufacturing s woes just as the industry looks to be finding firmer footing the sector slid into a technical recession in the first half of the year and intensified this fall pain that was particularly acute in midwestern swing states that could decide the 2020 presidential election advertisement the announcement extends far beyond boeing s own business joseph brusuelas chief economist at accounting firm rsm wrote in a note the damage will ripple throughout the economy affecting everything from inventory channels factory orders industrial production and ultimately headcount among boeing s vast network of suppliers that could lead to an even greater hit than the 0 5 percent cut to gdp several economists are projecting next quarter according to capital economics senior u s economist michael pearce it appears likely that at least some of the workers at the more than 600 smaller companies in the supply chain will be furloughed or laid off as a result of the decision pearce wrote in a note suppliers may also put on hold investment plans the longer the shutdown persists the more likely that is delivering a broader hit to consumption and investment growth the supply chain involved in making each 737 max is sprawling incorporating parts from japan korea and sweden but also washington state kansas utah and south carolina this graphic which brusuelas grabbed from boeing s website offers a view the company says it will work with suppliers to minimize the impact of its decision but the uncertainty will make it difficult to navigate the weeks and likely months ahead at a minimum with little ability to predict how long the production will be shut down suppliers such as spirit aerosystems which builds the max s fuselage in wichita and ships them across the country to washington state face a difficult decision my colleague aaron gregg reports those suppliers can either keep employees on staff indefinitely in the hope that boeing s production lines will resume quickly or furlough employees advertisement kansas gov laura kelly r announced she is directing state agencies to help however they can the company s stock dropped 2 7

largest buyer of the planes will be pulling approximately 300 flights a day from a peak day schedule in excess of 4 000 flights my colleague taylor telford reports customers who have booked these flights will be notified and reassigned to other planes last week american airlines extended its 737 max cancellations until early april after the federal aviation administration said it wouldn t approve the aircraft s return for the remainder of 2019 but boeing itself is bearing the brunt of the burden in an alternate universe where two 737 max crashes the most recent in march didn t force the worldwide grounding of the jets this would have been a red letter month for it the company was the dow s top performer in 2017 with its share price rising 90 percent then came the trump administration s trade war with china a direct threat since boeing sells 80 percent of its planes abroad and china is its largest single market the company s stock became a proxy for investor nerves

previous year gregg writes and its stock is off 26 percent from a high it notched in february through it all boeing has kept the production line rolling in hopes regulators would lift the grounding

but clearly what is required is regulatory certainty gita gopinath it is commendable that the government wants to get india very quickly to the 5 trillion mark they are focussing on investment in infrastructure and improving rural incomes and streamlining gst there is a bunch of policies that are put in place but just in terms of the math it is extremely challenging in terms of the 2024 25 deadline says chief economist excerpts from an interview with mihir bhatt of etnow at times networks india economic conclave india is one of the emerging markets where growth has surprised on the downside in october we were projecting india growing at 6 1 for 2019 and 7 for 2020 but if you look at the recent incoming data we will be revising the numbers and we will come out with new numbers in january it is likely to be a significant downward revision for india india is one of those emerging markets where growth has slowed down more i would not put a number at this point because this is something which we are still working on we will put it out in january i think january 20 but from what i am seeing it would be a significant downgrade in india what the picture looks like is one of very weak private demand in these last couple of quarters growth has relied quite heavily on government spending while on the other hand investment has slowed fairly strikingly consumption growth while still holding up is still slowing both private investment consumption and a cut back in imports is also a sign of weak private demand core inflation which is around 3 5 is again a sign of weakness in demand so private demand is weak at this point as you said some of the bottlenecks or frictions in the economy are not new for instance take the issues with the banking sector and the non banking financial corporations nbfcs if anything policies were put in place to improve the scenario and we did see some improvement the question then is what is driving the sudden change one indicator that was particularly telling was the survey of business sentiment rbi does this survey and it was put out recently from 2014 until september october of this year it is fairly flat and then it drops a bit it looks like there is a dramatic change in sentiment that has come about very recently that must be compounding the other forces that exist over there there is very much a case for stress in the financial system it is very much a case that rural income growth is weak and there are policies being undertaken to address them the monetary policy has had many rate cuts but we are still seeing very low pass through of those rate cuts into the real economy the us economy is actually quite strong at this point it has got record low unemployment rates we in fact projected the us economy to slow some more next year and we project china to slow some more next year for china it is a structural slowdown for the us as for many advanced economies again it is a structural slowdown because of ageing demographics and low productivity growth that would be a perfectly fine scenario if we saw a gradual slowing china was growing at blockbuster rates for a long time but that is not going to happen if it is a much larger economy it is a normal transition away from credit boom and external sector driven domestic growth we should expect to see china slowing down the recovery was in the rest of the world which was mostly in some very stressed emerging markets this is in latin america but we are thinking about turkey and also whether the euro area would stabilise we will see some improvement there so that is the sense which we expect to see there is a sense that things are getting a little more stable around the world one country among emerging markets where the numbers have surprised on the downside is india it is a very good aspiration to have it is commendable that the government wants to get india very quickly to the 5 trillion mark they are focussing on investment in infrastructure and improving rural incomes and streamlining gst there is a bunch of policies that are put in place but just in terms of the math it is extremely challenging in terms of the 2024 25 deadline if you just do that math it would require india to grow in nominal dollar terms by about 10 5 every year for the next five years over the last six years on an average india grew in dollar terms by 6 so to go from that 6 number to 10 5 if you do the calculation we would require a real growth rate of about 8 9 this is quite substantial but one can go past that 2024 25 date and think of a more medium term goal of getting to 5 trillion i am not going to put date on it at this point the manifesto situation is challenging right now there was this recent corporate income tax cut but they are offsetting revenue where sources of revenues were not announced so there is certainly a situation where it looks like the fiscal deficit might breach the target but in terms of fixing the problems in the economy the important thing you should recognise is where the problems are the problems are very much in the financial system at this point we have had the problems of non performing assets that has been around for a while processes have been put in place to fix it but they are certainly not working fast enough if you look at the pace of resolution of npas it is not happening at the pace it was stipulated to happen by law that is because there are serious capacity constraints to making this happen very quickly those capacity constraints which is the national company law tribunal have to be addressed second thing is 2019 is a year where the pass through for monetary policy rate cuts to actual lending rates has been quite weak it has come down relative to the previous year and the question is why is that one factor that seems to have come up is a bit of loss of risk appetite of the banking sector that is another feature that needs to be addressed if these aspects can be targeted more directly then we can have similar stimulus that has already been put in place work through the system it is a good idea to clean up the system and to have a sound regulation in place but clearly what is required is regulatory certainty it has to be the case that this is a fairly predictable environment in which you are functioning the rules are quite clear so that you can adapt to it and you can move quickly and you can have the capacity in place to implement these regulations in a way that does not create problems certainly more can be done there are many good programmes that have been announced and implemented and gst is one of those but again that is an area where most streamlining would help more clarity would help for making capital work much more easily those two have to go along because if you are going to put regulations in place it is important that people can adapt it it is not something that you are uncertain about going forward i believe gst was a very good reform it was the idea of having a single market and bringing the different disaggregated markets together and it was a very welcome development but more has to be done in improving its effectiveness the ease with which people can work with the system and those things still have to be worked out i believe the idea of gst was a perfectly good idea i would not this is a bit like comparing apples and oranges because china is a 14 trillion economy india is a 2 7 trillion economy they are very different sizes of economies you would expect to see china slowing and not growing at 7 or 8 but you would expect india to be growing at 7 or 8 they are at very different points in their growth cycle china s challenges are different china s challenges so far has been very high credit growth and that has driven the economy external demand infrastructure investment has driven the economy they have to find a way of transitioning away from this towards more consumption driven growth and to bring down leverage in the system they need financial regulatory tightening in china and that is what they are trying to do we would expect the economy to slow as that happens now they have been hit very strongly by the us china trade tensions they have some upside risk coming from the most recent pause on the trade tensions and the potential to rollback some of the tariffs in the case of india it is the opposite there is no credit growth story at this point the problem is a lack of credit growth and india is still a relatively domestic demand driven economy it is not a big part of global supply chains while the us china trade tensions have had some kind of indirect effect on india these are very different economies i believe much more has to be done on an accelerated fashion for the financial sector that would be the top up there what exactly would that be the non performing asset resolution has to be done in a much more timely fashion that was what the law originally said it should be that would require increasing the capacity of the tribunal secondly it deals with the stock of non performing assets but it is not dealing with the flow problem which is what is happening with new credit creation in the economy without appropriate governance change one cannot see the right kind of credit allocation you need to have improvement in governance of the banking sector and that is hugely important otherwise one will end up with the stock of another kind of non performing assets a few years from now so that has to be fixed the hope is that in the process there would be some further increase in risk appetite for the banking sector which would open up lending that could then push through the rate cuts that were done in monetary policy through the economy those are one set of reforms the second is rural income and rural income growth is an important driver of consumption in india that having slowed down has been an issue now there is obviously this double edged feature to it because on the plus side the period of low food prices and low food inflation has been good for the consumer it has been good in terms of inflation numbers but it has been tough for farmers who has been selling it right the question is how do we end up in a situation where you have low food inflation at the same time farmers incomes are not terribly affected the solution to that is higher productivity productivity in indian agriculture is quite low it is about one third of what it is in china it is about 1 of what it is in the us an increase in productivity in the agriculture sector either through new kinds of seed varieties or infrastructure through roads irrigation better storage facilities and productivity improvements can generate long lasting impact third it is very important for india to stay on track for fiscal consolidation the combined deficit of the centre and the states having a good stable macroeconomic environment is hugely important right now interest rates are very low everywhere in the world and india receives portfolio flows and fdi flows but that can change so one has to be prepared for an environment of that kind and that is very important too lastly this government with its huge mandate having a strong majority in parliament should be able to push through important structural reforms we have talked about land reforms and labour market reforms if you really want to get that big boost to go towards the 5 trillion target as quickly as possible these reforms will be necessary we had the projection for crude in october and the situation is very much the same it is about 60 65 a barrel the question is that we think risks are to the upside or to the downside in october because of the weakness in global demand we thought the risks were more to the downside for oil prices but at the same time there are geopolitical tensions and those things can come up again iran is an example of that and that can be another factor but our projection is on an average we do not expect to see a big uptick in oil prices and these are hard things to project but given the level of demand in the world given the sources of supply and the possible disruptions too our projections would be around the 60s again manufacturing is one sector that got hit really hard pretty much across the globe this was a combination of trade uncertainty but it is also was an outcome of the auto sector which did quite poorly in germany china and even in india this also had something to do with the tech side in terms of creations of new iphones and things of that kind we are seeing a bit of stabilisation in manufacturing especially in the auto sector we are seeing trade picking up and so we are seeing some improvement in manufacturing from india s perspective i would say that given the appetite for shifting global supply chains this would be a great time for india to be able to see that opportunity but those would require some serious reforms again in january i will have the exact numbers and you will tell you exactly what the projection path is going forward at this point instead of looking at some particular 8 number it is important for the stimulus which has been put in place in the economy to come through the corporate tax cut the monetary policy rate cuts the rural income support schemes if those can work through the system and change the business sentiment which is doing quite poorly at this point those can have a virtuous circle effect and that can push the economy out of the belt of the doldrums that it is stuck in
published wednesday 18 december 2019 print disqus by keith weiner phd monetary metals dear mr taft i eagerly read your piece warriors for opportunity on wednesday as i often do about pieces that argue that capitalism is not working today you begin by saying financial capitalism free markets powered by a robust financial system is the dominant economic model in the world today yet many who have benefited from the system agree it s not working the way it ought to leaving aside that our financial system is not robust the interest rate is collapsing and the debt is growing exponentially we do not have capitalism we have licensure of most professions and regulation of nearly every productive activity we have government owned roads airports harbors radio spectrum trains and schools this last item is plank 10 from the communist manifesto we have a vast array of subsidies both corporate and consumer and of course massive taxes to pay for it all this year tax freedom day was april 16 over one quarter of the year is spent working just for the government yet this massive rake is not enough to pay for the massive cost of the government in fy2019 the federal government added 1 2t to its debt i should say this is only the component of its debt that it acknowledges a private company would be forced to include accrued liabilities which would result in even larger total liabilities and an even larger deficit it would not be possible to borrow so much if we had a gold standard the interest rate would skyrocket so the government looted the gold of the people and made it illegal to own gold re legalizing it only after it was no longer part of the monetary system we have a central bank plank 5 to manage the interest rate under the fed s tender ministrations interest has been falling for four decades john maynard keynes said to drive interest rates to zero to kill the savers and overthrow the capitalist order politicians of course love the idea because the lower the interest rate the more they can borrow to finance their welfare schemes either way both the cause and the effect of the falling interest rate regime are not capitalist the cause is central planning of credit largely entrusted to the federal reserve the effect is to feed ever increasing quantities of the people s wealth into the hungry maw of the government and to enrich crony banks and corporations you ask rhetorically are we in fact witnessing the twilight years of capitalism we are clearly in the twilight years of something however that something is not capitalism it a crony system of nominally private ownership but under increasing government control in other words incipient fascism in the vision of benito mussolini who coined the term fascism there was private property however he clarified the nature of this property the fascist state organizes the nation but it leaves the individual adequate elbow room it has curtailed useless or harmful liberties while preserving those which are essential today nearly everyone agrees that we should have irredeemable currency and a central bank to manage it and thus the right to opt out by withdrawing gold coin from the banks enjoyed by americans until 1933 was deemed to be useless or harmful the saver was disenfranchised his interest rate preference is no longer respected and is another useless or harmful liberty thus the interest rate can be driven down nearly to zero or beyond zero in switzerland germany and a number of other countries you say even as capitalism has powered one of the longest and most sustained economic recoveries as well as one of the most durable bull markets in our lifetimes with the s p 500 trading near all time highs one of the seeds for the boom that began a decade ago it s not exactly a recovery were planted by president bush in december 2008 he said i ve abandoned free market principles to save the free market system to make sure the economy doesn t collapse and we had bailouts quantitative easing pork barrel spending and no one should forget when the accounting rules were changed in march 2009 so that if a bank held an asset worth 900 000 it could keep it on the books as 1 000 000 with respect none of this is capitalism it is true we have an incredible bull market everyone loves a bull market but let s get back to keynes for a moment as i noted above he wanted to push the interest rate to zero and he was explicit about unleashing destruction he noted that the process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose the reason why they are unable to diagnose it is that the price of the bond is the inverse of the interest rate falling interest means rising bond prices and arbitrage pushes up other asset prices most do not focus on the collapse in yields interest rates equity dividend yields real estate cap rates etc the collapse in yields is a subtle phenomenon most people prefer to focus on the much more obvious rise in asset prices who could be against a bull market it is not capitalism that you are describing when you say leverage was the tool used to jack up what had been sustainable growth to unsustainable levels in a free market no one would lend so much or at such dirt cheap interest rates this is on the fed which somehow people have come to think is part of capitalism i believe i have made my point that we don t have capitalism today or anything even close but you say one other thing to which i want to respond donald trump who promised in 2016 to deliver better standards of living for the middle class through his own version of ayn rand capitalism powered by a 1 trillion tax cut and one of the most sweeping across the board deregulatory initiatives we have ever seen first his deregulation is a myth it is true that under president trump the federal register is smaller than under president obama or bush however the federal register is the book of new regulations this means trump is adding new regulations at a slower rate than obama added them second a sweeping tax cut with no change to spending is a shift from taxing to borrowing and trump did not even keep spending flat he increased it significantly the problem with our system is not that it promotes what you call growth at any and all costs the problem is that we call borrowing to consume growth would anyone make the mistake of calling it family growth if a couple racks up 25 000 on their credit cards to go on a gambling binge to las vegas we should not make that mistake when uncle sam does it yet borrowing to consume adds to gdp finally i must say that if you read rand s novel atlas shrugged you see a big difference between her hero john galt who refuses the job of economic dictator and donald trump who directed the fed to lower interest rates anyone interested in ayn rand capitalism should read her short book capitalism the unknown ideal in essence there should be a complete separation of economy and state she argues against antitrust for example trump threatened antitrust action against amazon she included an essay by alan greenspan long before he took the job of federal reserve chairman i e economic dictator greenspan wrote cogently on the harm inflicted by a central bank sincerely keith weiner phd ceo monetary metals market report we apologize for publishing this report late we have been very busy developing the business the price of gold moved up 16 and that of silver 0 39 almost two groceries leaked out of that store of value par excellence bitcoin but hey stocks are up former fed chairman paul volcker passed away this week at the age of 92 the consensus among liberals and conservatives keynesians and monetarists free marketers and central planners is that volcker beat inflation while the various publications by and for these groups write their hagiographies we find ourselves writing something more critical ironically for a man with a reputation for fighting inflation volcker helped persuade president nixon to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar into gold he may be widely hailed as beating inflation but severing the last link between the dollar and gold is widely condemned as unleashing it we have two things to say about the idea that a man we are not picking on volcker per se beat inflation and stabilized a floating irredeemable fiat currency one this is tantamount to saying he is a good central planner a central planner is to an economy what a virus is to the body a foreign particle that takes over and reprograms the cells with a destructive code we must get up to the rooftops to bellow that it s not just a matter of finding the right man to make central planning work there is no right man and there is no right central plan even if the right quantity of dollars were static it varies moment by moment like everything else in the economy and even if the fed could know what that right quantity is it cannot the mechanism by which it would change the quantity of dollars is all wrong a free market is a process not an end result such as a price or a quantity supplied the central planner even if he set the right price would not create the same effect as the free market because he would not be creating the same cause the question is never which man should be economic dictator to use the fictional title from the novel atlas shrugged it is the existence of the institution itself two the very theory agreed by those liberals and conservatives keynesians and monetarists free marketers and central planners the quantity theory of money is wrong changing the quantity of dollars does not change inflation the way people suppose as knut wicksell observed in the 1890 s but has been forgotten the price level correlates to the interest rate not the quantity of money or dollars that is higher interest rates cause and are caused by higher prices and volcker to fight rising prices raised the interest rate it is a ratchet mechanism however there is a limit because the rising cycle is characterized by corporate borrowing to increase inventory of commodities that is they go deeper into debt to increase their hoarding of things which have declining marginal utility ultimately the cost of borrowing exceeds the profits to be made hoarding commodities i e waiting for prices to rise before selling one s product then bankruptcies and liquidations begin and the rising cycle is broken initiating a falling cycle we don t want to get too deeply into keith s theory of interest and prices here but we do want to note that whatever volcker may have thought he was doing and what people even today four decades later believe he did it just does not work that way the fed centrally plans the single most important price in the economic universe the price of credit specifically overnight credit this is an awesome power which no one should possess however there is a limit to this power the price of long term credit is subject to market forces and they interact with the force applied by the fed to create a dynamic this dynamic is characterized by positive feedback that is the system tends to run and run in one direction for decades when volcker was appointed in 1979 the trend of rising interest and rising prices had been going on since the end of wwii here is a graph of the fed funds rate the rate dictated by the fed it begins in 1954 the earliest data the st louis fed provides in this series the rate is a consistently rising trend with one exception the fed pulls it back once it has triggered a recession each time the pullback ends on a higher low the opposite of the trend today with lower highs before each recession we assume most readers know that consumer prices were rising relentlessly during this period by the time volcker got into power this trend had been running for so long that it would have been inconceivable for it to reverse much less to reverse on its own to make it stop the fed would have to do something like the doctors who let the blood of their patients based on the current medical science thinking of their day the volcker fed pushed up the interest rate further the time of managing the interest rate was over you can see how well their management worked in the chart above based on the current monetary science thinking now the fed would manage the general price level or at least the quantity of dollars which is held by said monetary science thinking to be causal of the general price level invalid theories can persist a long time sometimes shortly after bloodletting the patient would recover his body finally eradicated the influenza virus or staphylococcus bacteria people especially the doctor and the patient thought that the bloodletting worked have you ever noticed that on many elevators whether you press the door close button or whether you don t press it the doors close in about three to five seconds did you know that experiments show that when rats are addicted to cocaine they will keep pressing a bar to get another dose of drug even after researchers have removed the drug volcker immediately began pushing rates up he relented when a nasty recession occurred we assume that some doctors would cease bloodletting if the patient became pale in any event he resumed and raised rates again in this case we can t really say that that the corpus economicus got better this part is not analogous to the body defeating an infection a closer analogy would be that the giant wrecking ball of the economy had wreaked its damage on the north side of the street and began to swing to the south side when it begins destruction on this side nothing repairs the damage on the other side the north side of course is rising interest and prices the problems of that era were well known then and are still well known now the south side is falling interest and prices or soft prices if ever increasing mandated useless ingredients prevent them from falling manufacturers struggle to make enough margin to service their debts much less cover their cost of capital people now speak of the post industrial economy and a post manufacturing world of course this doesn t mean that we don t make things any more would you please excuse us as we finish typing this on a computer connected to the internet leave our office and trust the motion sensor light to turn off take the elevator down get in a car and drive to a restaurant that cooks meat in a kitchen with sophisticated equipment all of those things have to be made what people mean by this phrase post industrial is that industry is not where the value is they are right sadly that the value is in finance and especially where capital gains may be made industry struggles to earn scant profit margins quick somebody lower the interest rate the problems of keynes falling interest rate world are not well understand keynes smirked that not one in a million is able to diagnose the problem it was true then and it s still true now we hope that our report helps more people grasp the enormity and simplicity in a sense of the problem let

the last time a us president signed on to a major trade agreement in 2016 it was barack obama and the trans pacific partnership deal with 11 pacific rim nations politicians from both the republican and democratic parties soon rejected it today the us mexico canada agreement seems set to sail through a divided congress after democrats forced additional changes into the deal to replace the north american free trade agreement advertisement are there lessons here for crafting future free trade agreements with europe or china i don t know what the lesson here is in getting a free trade agreement passed because president trump did not says mary lovely a syracuse university economist and senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics one way to get a trade agreement passed is just to throw out free trade the new name does that quite literally but the substantial changes are smaller the 35 increase in us economic production that a key government analysis pdf expects is less than the half percentage point reduction provided by boeing s decision to temporarily shut down production of the 737 max at least as forecast by wall street lovely and her colleagues quibble with the international trade commission which produced the analysis they expect the deal will actually slow us economic growth a tiny amount since they are dubious of the itc s assumption that the deal will increase investment by eliminating uncertainty about future rules advertisement focus on workers however the deal has won over democrats and the afl cio the country s largest labor union which importantly represents american autoworkers a key reason are protections for the us auto and steel industries these come in the form of requirements to use more components in particular steel produced in north america that might lead to more investment in production in the us or to more jobs moving overseas since us auto tariffs outside of the usmca will remain at a relatively low 2 5 that s another reason analysts don t expect major changes the itc expects that these new rules will actually increase auto prices in the us but also increase the number of jobs in parts manufacturing there may be an analogy between trade protections and minimum wage laws both may hinder productivity while also benefitting workers overall but economists fret that more expensive us cars will be less competitive on the world market that s not to say labor loves the deal the economic policy institute a union backed think tank called usmca weak tea at best advertisement the deal also has a passel of new labor protections for mexican workers who earn the lowest wages and have the least protection among the three nations in the deal these include a 16 wage requirement for certain jobs more protection for independent unions and new labor inspections alvaro santos a georgetown law professor who advised mexican negotiators in 2018 is skeptical that these provisions will have much immediate impact on the us economy but says they may prove useful in the long term in pressing the mexican government to improve its workers lot lose the corporate give aways for democrats the political difference is also in the treatment of multinational corporations a common criticism of free trade deals is that they are often used by corporations as back door routes to win political priorities that aren t really about free trade the tpp failed in part because us negotiators wanted to make america s over the top protections for the pharmaceutical industry a global standard influential republican senator orrin hatch insisted on the provisions which rankled progressive democrats and trade counterparts alike usmca doesn t attempt to force other countries to adopt these protections advertisement another controversial provision allowed companies to challenge new laws in private arbitration called investor state dispute settlement isds it is intended to protect foreign companies from unlawful expropriation and some developing economies saw the provisions as important to attracting foreign investment but isds has been abused including by cigarette companies to battle public health regulations rather than enshrine it the new deal largely walks back isds provisions none of these changes are looked upon with favor by the free trade community one reason they were inked is that president donald trump and his chief trade negotiator robert lighthizer take a distinctly nationalistic view of trade seeking immediate gains for the us rather than a long term system of unfettered commerce many republicans are just glad to see the basic structures of the major regional trade deal remain in place given trump s repeated threats to pull out of nafta entirely trump s ability to cow his party into voting for a protectionist trade deal shouldn t surprise but it s a key reason usmca is expected to be enacted republicans may be ruing their decision to abandon the tpp under obama today against the backdrop of ongoing trade tensions with well everyone but especially china this does offer some hope to skeptical foreign interlocutors that the trump administration can make a deal on behalf of the united states assuming he doesn t blow it up with another tariff tantrum after it is finalized and lovely hopes that the new labor provisions are seen as effective and validate the afl cio s endorsement which could increase domestic confidence in future global deals advertisement while this deal isn t directly connected to the us tariff standoff with china it may offer hints about the long term future of the economic relationship between the two countries many american strategists still view joining the existing tpp or the cptpp as it s now called as the best way to create an economic bulwark against chinese expansion backing regional allies and setting the terms of global trade a future president may need to learn from usmca about how to make that happen

growth on nov 8 the imf stated that pakistan s fiscal deficits were narrowing and announced it would release the second tranche of its 6 billion financial assistance program to the country completion of the review will enable disbursement of sdr 328 million or around 450 million and will help unlock significant funding from bilateral and multilateral partners ramirez rigo head of an imf mission to islamabad had said in a statement after the mission completed its first review of its program the government policies have started to bear fruit helping to reserve the buildup of vulnerabilities and restore economic stability the external and fiscal deficits are narrowing inflation is expected to decline and growth although slow remains positive the imf statement said the imf had held meetings with federal bureau of revenue fbr chairman shabbar zaidi and advisor to the prime minister on finance abdul hafeez sheikh under the fund programme the imf mission had reviewed pakistan s performance against six performance criteria related to net international reserves nir net domestic assets nda net foreign currency swap position primary budget deficit target net government borrowing from the central bank and stock of sovereign guarantees issued by the government in addition there were two continuous performance criteria including zero new credit to the government by the sbp and on accumulation of external public payment arrears on top of that the authorities performance was also reviewed on five indicative targets including disbursements under bisp government spending on health and education tax collections payment of tax refunds and a freeze on power sector s circular debt the mission was in islamabad from oct 28 to nov 8 the imf said pakistan s near term economic outlook was broadly unchanged from the time of the program approval in april with gradually strengthening activity and average inflation expected to decelerate in the 2020 fiscal year however domestic and international risks remain and structural economic challenges persist it had stated positive for pakistan imf mission concludes successfully imf confirms that pakistan met all first quarter performance criteria by good margins and economy continuing to get better thank you pm and entire team dr abdul hafeez shaikh finance adviser to the prime minister had said in a tweet on the night of

completion of all prior actions committed by pakistan before signing the fund programme according to the signed agreement in july this year pakistan will get 2 billion annually under the eff for the period of three years the amount is supposed to help pakistan stabilise its crippling state of economy and recover from fiscal debt and inflation on oct 21 the imf and the world bank group had expressed support for pakistan s economy while the global funds had also appreciated the economic reforms of the country the assurances were given by the managing directors of the imf and the work

decisions were being made and implemented to stabilise pakistan s economy she had appreciated the commitment of the government and assured continued support of the imf for the reform process foreign exchange reserves swell to nine month high meanwhile pakistan s foreign exchange reserves have risen to nine month high of 17 29 billion as the state bank of pakistan sbp received 1 3 billion from the asian development bank adb the central bank s reserves have expanded to 10 41 billion whereas the reserves of commercial banks are 6 88 billion in the current financial year foreign exchange reserves have increased by 3 10 billion financial experts are of the view that despite the country s foreign exchange have swelled but that still does not meet the standards of the imf which considers that the reserves of any country should be equal to imports for at least three months the asian development bank adb and pakistan on monday struck a loan agreement of 1 3 billion for budgetary support and reforms of the country this will help stabilise the foreign exchange reserves of the country and strengthen pakistan s slowing economy under the agreement the adb has committed to providing 1 billion

speech by benoît cœuré member of the executive board of the ecb at the ecb colloquium on monetary policy the challenges ahead held in his honour in a few days i will leave the ecb after eight years of unprecedented challenges for the integrity and stability of our single currency the euro throughout these years the ecb s resolve and steadiness have been the cornerstone of europe s crisis response and economic recovery i feel grateful and humbled to have been given a chance to be part of this effort i would like to thank former president mario draghi my executive board and governing council colleagues and the staff of this great institution for their friendship and trust and i would like to wish isabel schnabel and fabio panetta the best of luck the starting point for my remarks this morning is people s sense of frustration and their criticism of central banks for failing to deliver inflation consistent with their aim this criticism has taken different forms in society professional observers and financial market participants often criticise the inadequate size of our actions and question the effectiveness of our instruments private citizens criticise the type of instruments we use in particular asset purchases and negative interest rates and the side effects they associate with them the use of these instruments has caused persistent mistrust while three in four euro area citizens think the single currency is good for the european union and two in three think it is good for their country less than half of citizens trust the ecb in my remarks this morning i would like to make two points that speak to these concerns the first is that there is no contradiction between inflation being low and monetary policy being effective central banks have achieved great success in recent years their achievements however and this will be my second point are of little avail if the public does not recognise or understand them i will argue that this veil of effectiveness creates enormous challenges for the credibility and acceptance of central banks challenges which can only be overcome by revisiting the appropriateness of four key components at the heart of our current monetary policy frameworks how we define price stability how we measure inflation how we evaluate the credibility of our intentions and the range of counterparts through which we implement monetary policy low inflation and the effectiveness of monetary policy my first point how to square low inflation with policy effectiveness centres on two separate questions how should we the central banking community evaluate the effectiveness of our own actions and why despite years of extraordinary policy support is inflation remaining stubbornly low evaluating our own actions is surprisingly difficult there is no handbook no checklist that we can use to consistently grade our actions ultimately of course there can only be one yardstick to measure central bank effectiveness our track record in delivering inflation consistent with our aim but does inflation failing to converge to our aim mechanically imply that our actions have not been effective my answer is a clear no despite unprecedented challenges to monetary policy implementation central banks have succeeded in delivering financial and monetary conditions that are exceptionally supportive of real economic activity many euro area firms can currently borrow in financial markets at negative rates bank lending rates also for small and medium sized firms are currently at or close to historical lows with little dispersion across major economies firms have responded to these incentives as economic theory would predict over the past five years real investment has expanded at a faster pace than in the five years preceding the global financial crisis this is no small achievement considering the persistent uncertainty that has weighed on sentiment in recent years investment in turn has boosted job creation employment is up by 7 compared with mid 2014 and in many euro area countries wages are growing at the fastest pace in many years all in all ecb staff estimates show that without our policy actions euro area real gdp would have been up to 2 7 percentage points lower at the end of last year and inflation would have been up to half a percentage point lower every year over the past four years explaining low inflation such counterfactuals based on a wide range of models are important proof that policy has been effective along the full chain of transmission from financial market prices to economic activity and from the real side to the nominal side for everything we know about how policy propagates through the economy inflation today would be significantly weaker in the absence of our actions maybe even dangerously close to deflation but such counterfactuals are far too complex to lend true credibility to our actions outside of our narrow circle they still raise the question as to why policy support has failed to promote a more robust convergence of inflation to levels that would allow a normalisation of policy that would allow graduating the instruments that have caused mistrust and concern there are two broad hypotheses for why this might be the case the first is that policy has been wrongly calibrated that is slack is larger than widely assumed and policy should be even more accommodative true the output gap is an elusive concept that should never have become a gauge for conducting public policy and it may be larger than thought and broader measures of unemployment that include for example involuntary part time work remain well above headline unemployment but these measures are now no longer higher than they were before the crisis i would also dismiss the assertion that the relationship between output and inflation has broken down a plethora of empirical studies prove that the phillips curve is alive and well the second and in my view more plausible explanation is that the phillips curve has shifted inward over time that is inflation today may be lower at every level of the output gap such shifts typically relate to persistent and slow moving changes on the supply side of our economies where monetary policy has less traction as such they are difficult to detect and even more difficult to prove in particular when they coincide with weak aggregate demand but collectively their impact on wage and price inflation is difficult to dismiss just consider the structural changes in global energy markets where the shale oil revolution has effectively put a ceiling on oil prices by increasing the responsiveness of oil supply to demand shocks think of the secular decline in wage bargaining power that contributed to a significant part of recent productivity gains no longer being distributed to labour with adverse consequences for real disposable incomes consumption growth and ultimately inflation or consider the salient impact of digitalisation on the pricing power of brick and mortar firms which may have contributed at least in part to the recent decline in the pass through of higher wage costs to consumer prices add to these shocks the effects of ageing the rise of services and the broader effects of globalisation and it is hard not to conclude that the combination of these shocks is likely to have put a lid on inflation in recent years and that these shocks are likely to constrain price pressure also in the near future none of this is necessarily bad news many of these shocks are in fact benign in the sense that they have the potential to ultimately lift productivity and real wages and pave the way to a low carbon economy central banks clearly need to step up their research and modelling capacities to understand their joint impact but until this happens and the pace will depend a lot on our broader economic policy framework which i won t discuss this morning central banks are likely to have to navigate in a low growth low inflation environment with the risk of repeatedly failing to deliver inflation in line with their aim monetary policy in a low inflation environment what then can or should central banks do in this environment let me propose four elements for future reflection how we define price stability how we treat inflation expectations how we measure inflation and how we implement monetary policy some proposals are more far reaching than others but all share one aim to bring monetary policy closer to the people to dismantle the veil of effectiveness and to foster acceptance of policies and instruments that too often are used as scapegoat for shortcomings and deficiencies elsewhere in our public policy apparatus rethinking the definition of price stability consider first the ecb s definition of price stability as inflation rates of below but close to 2 a simple answer to the current challenges would be to lower the inflation aim if my dissection of the current inflation drivers is vaguely on the right track then it is clear that this strategy would be wrong on many levels it would misjudge the current low inflation episode as permanent and thereby dismiss the lessons of history on the slow pace of diffusion of new technologies it would create perilous time consistency challenges for central banks when inflation eventually transitions to the new steady state and it would shift a disproportionate share of the macroeconomic adjustment burden onto workers as even more so than today shocks to euro area economies would have to be accommodated by lowering nominal wages not the best way to foster support for europe and its single currency raising the aim is similarly misguided why raise an aim that you have failed to achieve in the first place i come at this debate from a different angle if we communicate that we aim to maintain inflation at say 1 9 then we should not be surprised if the public expects us to control inflation up to the first decimal point it significantly raises the bar for maintaining the credibility of monetary policy particularly given how little the public actually knows about inflation and monetary policy we need to dismantle the absurd idea of an omnipotent central bank that can mechanically steer inflation the ecb should clarify that it aims to deliver inflation of 2 over the medium term and it could communicate the range of inflation outcomes that can be considered acceptable in normal times such a tolerance band which can be more or less precise is not an invitation for inaction or complacency research shows that central banks have a strong incentive to already respond to inflation deviations within the tolerance zone rather than waiting until inflation has crossed the edges and there is no convincing evidence that a tolerance band weakens the anchoring role of a midpoint it rather recognises the large and inherent uncertainty surrounding price and wage decisions conveys this uncertainty to the general public and its elected representatives and establishes consistency with the medium term horizon of the ecb s strategy for this change to be effective however two elements are critical first the ecb would need to do more to communicate the midpoint to the broader public a recent survey in the united states showed that only a quarter of respondent households knew of the federal reserve s 2 inflation aim and second the ecb would need to establish a clear track record that emphasises the centrality of the midpoint in the conduct of its policy the 2 needs to remain the clear nominal anchor for coordinating both expectations and actions which inflation expectations matter the second element we should review relates to how we should evaluate expected deviations from the midpoint target critics would dismiss the idea of tolerance bands around the inflation aim because they fear that by signalling our comfort with a range of inflation rates below 2 we would entrench expectations of low inflation and risk downplaying the nominal anchor i have two comments in response to these fears the first is that we can no longer ignore the fact that medium term inflation expectations of both professional forecasters and financial market participants have persistently adjusted lower adaptive expectations are rational at times of deep structural change my second comment is really more of a question which expectations should central banks consider when evaluating risks to the inflation outlook neither the academic community nor the central banking community have ever provided an answer to this question i see a large gap between the role played by inflation expectations in our profession and the extent of central banks actual knowledge about how expectations ultimately affect inflation outcomes and which expectations are concerned market based measures are convenient because they are readily available but convenience may prove delusive household inflation expectations for example have been found to be a better proxy of firms pricing decisions than those of professional forecasters or financial market participants but expectations by household have pointed in a very different direction in recent times painting a much less dire picture regarding the inflation outlook according to one survey households believed that annual euro area inflation between 2004 and 2018 was close to 9 when in fact it was 1 6 does the consumer price index need to be changed the third element relates to the way we measure inflation the harmonised index of consumer prices hicp has been a tremendous achievement in terms of providing a reliable timely and comparable measure of consumer inflation across eu member states but whether it adequately captures the cost of living should be subject to regular review a well known example is the cost of housing the hicp captures only marginally the largest single lifetime expenditure of households their cost of housing housing costs currently enter the hicp mainly through actual rentals with a weight of just 6 5 the costs of owner occupied housing by contrast are not included even though more than 65 of households in the euro area own their main residence careful reflection is warranted but allowing a wedge to persist between the inflation that households perceive and the rate we officially measure can undermine the validity of our actions rethinking central banks toolkit re evaluating the appropriateness of these three elements the inflation aim the role of inflation expectations and inflation measurement would probably go a long way towards revitalising policy in line with the current challenges but it may not be enough if the current environment of persistently low underlying inflation and elevated uncertainty were to persist well into the future and there is a risk that it may then the odds are large that firms and social partners will increasingly start adjusting prices and wages accordingly in this case more forceful policy action would be needed one option would then be to do more of the same i have no doubt that the ecb can further ease financing conditions by deploying its current instruments but one may doubt whether this approach would be more effective in bringing inflation closer to the aim than it has been so far and one may wonder how far the depth of our shallow capital markets can be sounded and whether the side effects of our measures would not outweigh the benefits at some point in the future a second possible and complementary option is to coordinate economic policies more closely the combination of limited fiscal policy space in many euro area countries political fixation on large fiscal surpluses in some and the persistent opposition to a common fiscal capacity makes this option less credible however coordination with fiscal authorities cannot be a fig leaf for central bank inaction or inability to act and it can easily degenerate into a threat to central bank independence but central banks have one key strength and that is their agility they have always been able to reinvent themselves to innovate and overcome even severe impediments to transmission and if transmission through financial markets and banks hits a wall if the third stage of transmission remains anaemic then central banks have the obvious choice of considering whether to broaden the set of counterparties through which they implement monetary policy the discussion about central bank digital currencies is a case in point at the heart of this discussion is the question of whether central banks should grant the general public direct access to their balance sheets this question comes with many thorny technological choices and policy challenges in particular with regard to financial stability and the future of credit intermediation as we know but assuming that these challenges can be overcome then there are few reasons why central banks within their mandate should not apply the same set of instruments to accounts of private individuals that they currently apply to banks that is charge interest rates on central bank digital money by going to the heart of consumer choices this approach would likely be more effective and faster in stimulating demand and inflation and it could have less negative side effects rather than addressing the symptoms of low inflation this would amount to precision surgery on the euler equation none of this is to say that it would be trivial ultimately central banks would need to weigh the costs against the benefits just like we did for other unconventional policy measures what we should avoid however is restricting our toolkit for dogmatic reasons or intellectual convenience and giving up on our ability to deliver on our mandate if monetary policy remains a conversation between central banks and financial markets we shouldn t be surprised if people don t trust us too many see us as part of a financial system which has failed to deliver growth and fairness and this also curtails our policy options conclusion let me conclude technological progress will continue to transform monetary policy in the future to what extent and in what ways will depend both on the preferences of society and the risks that a very protracted period of low inflation poses to macroeconomic and financial stability there will be evolutionary changes that will ensure that current and tested policy frameworks remain fit for purpose these changes may include progress on how we measure inflation and the evolving consensus on how we define price stability and there will be revolutionary changes similar in scale and scope to the shift from banknotes to bank deposits a few centuries ago or the recent adoption of negative interest rates technology will create new policy choices and options enabling central banks to continue acting within their mandates as mario draghi said at his last press conference never give up i wish christine lagarde and her team the best of luck and i fully trust that they will find the wisdom and courage to act in the face of ever changing conditions as the ecb has always done in its history thank you
view pdf introduction reducing us vulnerability to ccp corruption the united states is now engaged in long overdue efforts to counter economic threats from china fueled by chinese communist party ccp misrule but as policymakers reach for tariffs sanctions and other weapons of economic statecraft some of america s basic financial defenses continue to be overlooked the most urgent problem is that the us government still has no idea who really controls shell companies being used to move billions of dollars through and within its borders the ccp like other adversarial regimes routinely hides behind shell companies to exploit the global financial system in pursuit of geopolitical objectives but it also presides over the world s second largest economy much of the cronyism crime and corruption that afflicts china is the result of prolonged communist misgovernment and is facilitated by opaque corporate networks that now reach far beyond its borders ending anonymous ownership of shell companies is a critical first step to protect the us financial system from the criminal by product of ccp misrule in china it will also set a global standard that can be enforced as a new tool of coercive economic statecraft renewing american leadership in the fight against illicit finance and undermining the ccp s global assault on the rule of law anonymous shell companies america s achilles heel no other country prosecutes foreign crime and corruption with the same aggressiveness resources and global reach as the united states but the strength of the us economy and the us dollar s ubiquity as the global reserve currency also make the united states highly attractive for money launderers looking to convert rubles riyals or renminbi one vulnerability in particular makes it irresistible the ability to create and control shell companies with complete anonymity a recent study found that all fifty us states require more personal information from someone trying to obtain a library card than they do from anyone setting up a company researchers posing as terrorists and kleptocrats for another academic project found that the united states was the easiest place in the world to set up shell companies the professional services providers they used simply had no reason to ask basic questions about their clients identity it is therefore unsurprising that according to the world bank us shell companies have been used more often than those of any other country in major transnational corruption cases indeed the failure to collect corporate beneficial ownership information is the primary reason experts now rank the united states as the world s second worst financial secrecy haven between switzerland and the cayman islands anonymous shell companies continue to provide a backdoor into the us financial system and broader economy as the administration and congress work to counteract serious threats arising from ccp misrule these companies are a vulnerability the united states can no longer afford china s ip theft and shell companies trade secret theft software piracy and counterfeit goods are estimated to cost the united states between 225 billion and 600 billion annually china is the world s principal ip infringer according to the us ip theft commission deeply committed to industrial policies that include maximizing the acquisition of foreign technology and information beyond commercial losses ccp misappropriation of technology with security applications poses an obvious threat to national security the ip theft commission further notes that chinese entities rely on shell companies both to obscure their involvement in ip theft and to shield themselves from potential us sanctions as the china economic and security review commission has warned even a strengthened committee on foreign investment in the united states will be unable to detect and properly scrutinize chinese investments in us technology firms if their ownership is masked by shell companies chinese entities have also acquired valuable american ip and technology by using shell companies to conceal their participation in us bankruptcy proceedings a government accountability office gao study of 1 406 high security us federal leases could not identify the owners in about one third of cases because many of them were shell companies in cases where the gao did identify the owners nine out of fourteen government agencies working on sensitive national security issues were unaware that the buildings in which they were housed were ultimately owned by companies in china and elsewhere a recent nbc investigation found that thousands of chinese nationals have used us registered shell companies as phony employers to remain in the united states illegally after their student visas expire many go on to work for us firms dealing with sensitive information and at least one is now being prosecuted for espionage nearly 90 percent of counterfeit products entering the united states originate in china this poses a unique challenge for defense procurement where substandard equipment jeopardizes the safety of military personnel and compromised technology provides a window for espionage another recent gao study found that shell companies are routinely used to facilitate fraud and circumvent restrictions barring foreign contractors including one whose faulty parts caused the grounding of forty seven us combat aircraft gao also noted that contractors fraudulently misrepresenting themselves to could actually be operated by adversarial foreign governments sabotage or surveillance shell company secrecy also incentivizes american importers of counterfeit goods a new york company currently faces charges of illegally importing chinese surveillance technology and selling it to us government agencies before laundering the proceeds through shell companies sanctions evasion through shell companies for obvious reasons the ability to hide financial transactions behind shell companies severely undermines the effectiveness and integrity of us sanctions programs china s state controlled corporations routinely employ shell companies to circumvent us sanctions and distance themselves from malign behavior huawei is accused of deceiving us banks by using a shell company registered in mauritius to disguise business activities in iran the us government likewise targeted zte for using shell companies to buy and sell goods that washington has banned for export to iran and other countries an integral part of the illicit financial networks on which north korea depends are shell companies registered not only in chinese financial centers but around the world as us treasury officials routinely complain to beijing pyongyang uses them to help procure everything from nuclear weapons components to luxury cars for kim jong un a us court recently held three of china s biggest banks in contempt for failing to supply documents relating to allegations that they laundered 100 million through a hong kong shell company for a sanctioned north korean bank while the majority of shell companies used to evade sanctions are registered overseas a quick search of office of foreign assets control designations shows that as of december 2019 around sixty such entities are located within the united states the belt and road initiative s use of shell companies china s belt and road initiative bri has supercharged kleptocracy throughout the developing world with bribes and unprecedented opportunities for embezzlement offered to local elites in exchange for infrastructure contracts and other investments china s debt diplomacy inevitably comes at the expense of us influence as political leaders who are both publicly and personally beholden to the ccp can never be reliable security partners for the united states local politicians rely on shell companies to funnel bribes or stolen funds while chinese contractors can hide behind them to avoid accountability when they fail to deliver on overambitious projects from ecuador s crumbling dam to kenya s unaffordable railway and sri lanka s infamous stolen port the ability to conceal corruption underpins bri expansion worldwide malaysia s 1mdb heist offers a particularly egregious example according to reports ccp officials in return for infrastructure deals promised to bankroll the siphoning of 4 5 billion from the country s development fund into shell companies and opaque investments tried to dissuade us law enforcement from investigating and then spied on the american and british reporters exposing the scheme communist corruption and shell company concealment after decades of communist party misrule china is not only the world s second largest economy but a predatory pervasive and entrenched kleptocracy illicit financial outflows are conservatively estimated to have exceeded 1 trillion between 2002 and 2011 alone opaque corporate networks sit at the heart of the corrupt system that sustains and empowers the ccp s ruling elite it is illegal for chinese citizens to personally transfer more than 50 000 per year out of china how then can senior ccp officials on modest salaries including xi jinping who earns approximately 20 000 annually transfer the funds to finance the education and lavish lifestyles of relatives in the west in 2016 the panama papers leaks exposed how china s most prominent political families including relatives of xi jinping and other senior politburo members use shell companies to conceal their vast international holdings china was the offshore law firm mossack fonseca s predominant source of business with clients linked to around 40 000 shell and other companies china s state media complained in 2014 that the united states had become the top destination for corrupt ccp officials with more than 150 hiding their wealth here fueling the fentanyl crisis anonymous shell companies play a critical role in facilitating both the chinese production and us distribution of opioids that killed more than 47 000 americans in 2017 a figure that has increased almost six fold since 1999 according to the national money laundering risk assessment of 2018 fentanyl is generally produced in china can be purchased online and shipped directly to individual buyers in the united states or shipped to criminal organizations in mexico canada and the caribbean for distribution in the united states law enforcement notes the increasing prevalence of chinese money laundering networks working with mexican drug traffickers anonymous shell companies facilitate every stage of fentanyl production and distribution chinese producers tend to conceal their operations using opaque corporate structures registered in hong kong and other chinese financial centers us registered shell companies meanwhile are used not only to launder profits but to conceal connections with latin american cartels and hide ownership of freight forwarding firms p o boxes and other properties used as fronts to receive fentanyl shipments directly from china human trafficking and forced labor via shell companies the ccp has one of the world s worst records on using forced labor and failing to prevent human trafficking shell companies provide a corporate veil behind which criminals can prey on the world s most vulnerable people with impunity a report on 9 000 illicit massage businesses across the united states found that the majority of victims were women from china and south korea while 3 000 of these businesses had no corporate records at all only 28 percent of the remaining 6 000 listed a real person as their owner the rest were untraceable shell companies within china itself uyghurs detained in xinjiang province are routinely forced to produce textiles and other goods shell companies are one of the unique difficulties in chinese supply chains that help make the origins of such products untraceable for us importers empowering us law enforcement anonymously owned shell companies fuel ccp misrule and facilitate a broad range of threats to us security prosperity and values but the pushback begins with a surprisingly modest administrative measure many us allies and partners including all european union member states are establishing corporate beneficial ownership registries that require anyone setting up a company to disclose its true owner s contrast this situation with the united states where the only requirement is to disclose legal owners who may be no more than a disinterested lawyer incorporation agent or even just another shell company the immediate benefit of introducing a us corporate beneficial ownership register would be to provide law enforcement officials with a powerful new investigative tool the united kingdom is now producing valuable evidence on how this works in practice having created its own register in 2016 not only did initial fears over potential compliance burdens on small businesses prove unfounded but all british law enforcement agencies have made use of the register and most now access it at least weekly in the course of ongoing investigations a new tool of us economic statecraft of course a us corporate beneficial ownership register would do nothing to address the non us shell companies used in many of the examples above but the adoption of such a measure by the world s most powerful country would set an important new global standard to be enforced against corrupt authoritarian regimes and other problematic jurisdictions at meetings of the financial action task force and other international fora the failure of the united states to tackle shell company abuse leaves it open to accusations of hypocrisy in the fight against transnational crime it is a source of increasing tension between us officials and their european counterparts an unnecessary technocratic difference compared to sanctions and other substantive policy disagreements introducing a beneficial ownership register would turn this situation on its head empowering us officials to assume leadership of a nascent coalition of democracies already promoting measures to improve basic corporate transparency the treasury department would be able to pile further pressure on less scrupulous jurisdictions that negligently or purposefully maintain weak anti money laundering regimes and lax enforcement by forcefully shining a light into these darker corners of the global economy washington can gradually eradicate corporate conduits for malign conduct and dirty money worldwide the united states already maintains a powerful economic arsenal to do so including not only sanctions but actions under section 311 of the usa patriot act which can effectively cut troublesome foreign financial institutions off from the us dollar wielded properly corporate transparency will not only strengthen the potency of existing measures but can become a new coercive tool of economic statecraft in its own right this is not a far fetched proposal indeed us officials stand ready to promote corporate transparency as aggressively as they have promulgated sanctions and other measures targeting the illicit financial networks empowering america s adversaries but they need a congressional mandate to do so current legislative proposals to end shell company abuse there is now growing bipartisan support for action to tackle shell company abuse in october 2019 the us house of representatives passed the corporate transparency act mandating the creation of a beneficial ownership register administered by the financial crimes enforcement network at the treasury department for the first time establishing a beneficial ownership register is also a us government priority according to a statement of administration policy issued by the white house it would help prevent malign actors from leveraging anonymity to exploit these entities for criminal gain important progress in strengthening national security supporting law enforcement and clarifying regulatory requirements in the senate the corporate transparency act and true incorporation transparency for law enforcement title act would also create corporate beneficial ownership registries there is significant bipartisan momentum behind a third bill the improving laundering laws and increasing comprehensive information tracking of criminal activity in shell holdings illicit cash act this would not only create a beneficial ownership register but introduce important updates to the broader us anti money laundering regime require a new government strategy to stop authoritarian regimes abusing the us financial system and commission an official report on the scale and nature of chinese money laundering activities within the united states conclusion terrorists kleptocrats drug cartels and other transnational criminals have used shell companies to facilitate dangerous activity for decades but ccp control of the world s second largest economy presents an unprecedented threat to the integrity of the us financial system a beneficial ownership register would be a modest first step to empower law enforcement and strengthen the outdated us anti money laundering system american leadership to promote corporate transparency could set a new global standard that severely restricts conduits for ccp crime and corruption while expanding the us economic arsenal for the emerging struggle between democratic capitalism and authoritarian kleptocracy view pdf

causes of the crisis impact of the crisis how to get out of the crisis the collapse of the central bank of lebanon following a major state scam plunged the country into an unparalleled economic and financial crisis the reality of its situation is very different from the perception of its citizens the central bank of lebanon has again authorized private banks to freely deliver lebanese pounds but still no dollars this exchange control is illegal in law because it has not been validated by parliament several large companies have already filed an application for interim relief before the courts this financial crisis led parliament to adopt a new tax that triggered the demonstrations that have paralysed the country since october 17 2019 in fact since its creation during the second world war 1943 there that allowed it to preserve its influence after decolonization by depriving the lebanese of any national political life the attempt by us secretary of state henry kissinger to settle the israeli question by making lebanon the homeland of palestinian arabs provoked a civil war 1975 1989 and ended in failure the saudi peace imposed by the taif agreement 1989 restored the confessional system and extended community quotas to all public service jobs the syrian military presence 1989 2005 validated by the international community made it possible to rebuild the country but did not solve any problems 1992 98 and 2000 04 he had raked in 16 billion at the end of his life under the taif agreement rafiq hariri as a representative of the saudi royal family was protected by the syrian peace force present in the country to end the civil war during his assassination it was discovered that he had corrupted the two syrian officials responsible for overseeing peacekeeping the head of the intelligence services ghazi kanaan and vice president abdel halim khaddam the first committed suicide and the second fled to france where he made an alliance with the muslim brotherhood and prepared for the overthrow of president bashar al assad in 2005 the syrian peacekeeping force abruptly withdrew at the request of the lebanese population which saw it as a symbol of its own crimes during the civil war and held it wrongly responsible for the assassination of former prime minister rafiq hariri from 2006 to 2014 i e during the power vacuum and then the presidency of michel sleimane protected mainly from qatar and secondarily from france theit is now materially impossible to determine what taxes have been levied what international aid lebanon has received or what it has spent during this period but for the personal benefit of political leaders dollar deposits earned twice as much interest as in other countries but the interest on these deposits was paid with the money of the new depositors when a major depositor withdrew his money the system faltered political leaders had time to transfer their loot abroad before it collapsed thus last october former prime minister fouad siniora broke all records by secreting away between 6 and 8 billion ill acquired dollars in response to the disaster the acting president of the government he then wrote to china egypt france italy russia saudi arabia turkey and the united states to ask them to guarantee unpaid amounts for the import of basic necessities which must be repaid as soon as exchange controls are lifted in response the main states involved in the economic rescue of lebanon met on december 11 in paris in the morning they discussed behind closed doors their political interest in saving lebanon or letting it sink then in the afternoon they received a lebanese delegation indignant at the idea of new foreign supervision over the country lebanese petitions have been sent to foreign donors to dissuade them from paying money to the central bank until the origin of the crisis has been established but they immediately questioned the authenticity of the central bank s balance sheet and the probity of its director riad salamé hitherto considered an exemplary banker this historical reminder highlights hezbollah s lack of responsibility for the crisis despite the fact that the western press claims the opposite similarly it is important to note that while hezbollah accepts the zakat muslim donation of drug traffickers in the bekaa valley and the shia diaspora in latin america it has always opposed drug cultivation when it came to government it proposed and implemented social assistance programs so that farmers could evolve and change their crops money laundering instituted by the united states and benefiting lebanese bankers mainly christians and sunnis lebanon had never been able to simultaneously fill the functions of christian president of the republic sunni president of the government the unicameral assembly and the constitutional council from 2005 to 2016 most of the others have reduced their working hours in order to proportionally reduce the wages paid without having to lay off their employees so the entire sector of aid to the poor is devastated foreign workers especially asian domestic workers who are paid in lebanese pounds have lost half of what they used to transfer monthly in dollars to their families thousands have already left the country everyone will have noticed that tthe slogans are exactly the same throughout the country and in all communities which gives the demonstrators an illusory sense of the end of the confessional system the designation of the christian president of the republic michel aoun as the main target of the free patriotic movement cpl suggests that the movement is organised against him the united states position is ambiguous on the one hand theto the lebanese army to purchase equipment former us ambassador to lebanon jeffrey feltman testified before congress stating what he had written that is according to him every american must fight the iran herbollah cpl white house alliance the proposal to appoint businessman samir khatib as sunni president of the government was rejected by the grand mufti indeed in lebanon the christian president of the republic is appointed by the maronite patriarch the sunni president of the government by the mufti and the shiite president of the parliament by the mullahs and then they are confirmed by the single chamber for their part the kateb maronite phalangists proposed diplomat and magistrate nawaf salam to make a good face in any case the mufti is in favour of a renewal of saad hariri but this time at the head of a government of technocrats who in any case will be chosen by the three presidents accused of prevarication the free patriotic movement cpl of the christian president of the republic michel aoun has already indicated that it would not participate in the next government he does not intend to be held responsible for future problems under the pretext of covering the embezzlement of funds for which it is accused and which it denies the clashes which took place on december 14 in beirut illustrate the emptiness of the unrest in the early afternoon who had set up tents in the city centre in the evening other young people from the groups that had been attacked shortly before tried to invade parliament and proclaim it the colourful revolution as they did in serbia georgia and many other countries for the lebanese haunted by the memory of the civil war the hundred or so wounded including the forces of order cause unbearable anguish we are therefore heading once again towards a wobbly system because the major powers have been playing with lebanon for 76 years and the lebanese have been submitting to it contrary to the demands of the demonstrators at best they stole money to serve their community at worst to enrich themselves personally lebanon is one of the few countries in the world where billionaires suddenly appear without anyone knowing where their wealth comes from therefore it is not necessary to drive them all out but to rely on the former by encouraging them to serve the nation rather than their only community and to imprison the latter they have still not resolved the trauma of the civil war and continue to see their religious warlords as the only bulwarks against possible aggression from other communities this implies the recognition of the most legitimate personality to lead the country to its destiny it doesn t matter what his confession is and in this case after the victory of his network of resistance against the israeli invader who is indisputably the legitimate personality for the moment it is impossible to change the constitution the parliamentarians who would be massively swept away are too attached to their seats and will not do so a referendum will not do this either because corruption is everywhere including among voters 45 of them admit to having been solicited to sell their vote in lebanon political parties are denominational they do not have a national ambition but they defend their community and distribute prebends to it this is what the sunni president of the government saad hariri had proposed and which was refused him by the demonstrators then it will be necessary to attack warlords from the civil war who must prove their usefulness today or leave public life
nab the nab survey employment index and seek job ads suggest that the demand for labour remains weak such that we continue to expect slower trend growth in employment accordingly nab expects a moderate bounce of 17k in november after last month s surprise 19k fall alongside moderate employment growth we expect unemployment to remain unchanged after ticking up to 5 3 last month note our medium term view remains for a gradual increase in unemployment td securities following the first negative headline employment print in 3 years in oct we anticipate a mild reversal 12k in nov the overall trends in partials don t point to a positive trend change yet and nab s capacity utilisation index is heading back towards lows for the year we expect the u e rate participation rate to remain unchanged from oct levels at 5 3 66 respectively capital economics the 19 000 drop in employment in october marked the largest fall since 2016 admittedly the employment component of the nab business survey is consistent with monthly job gains of just 20 000 but we suspect there will be a bounce back in november after october s sharp fall and have pencilled in a 40 000 increase the participation rate dropped in each of the last two months which prevented the unemployment rate from rising much further we ve pencilled in a renewed increase from 66 0 to 66 1 which would result in a stable unemployment rate of 5 3 looking further ahead though we still expect employment growth to slow and the unemployment rate to creep higher today s agenda local labour force november nz third quarter

in a meeting with the russian security council secretary on december 2 chinese president xi jinping said that russia and china are increasing cooperation to safeguard their core interests and the common security because he united states and some other western countries have increased their interference in the internal affairs of china and russia according to the south china morning post these relations are expanding beyond broader economic ties to deeper security cooperation that may develop into some form of military alliance this was hours after president xi was on a video conference with russian president vladimir putin marking the opening of a 55 billion pipeline from siberia to china the latest manifestation of closer economic ties between the two nations the deal is worth an estimated 400 billion and is the biggest contract in russian state run energy company gazprom s history vladimir putin and xi jinping supervised the opening of the powerofsiberia pipeline that energizes russia china ties and provides a physical link between two nations that are ideologically united in determination to challenge the u s dominated order thetrumpet com thetrumpet_com december 12 2019 this is only the latest example of the growing economic partnership between russia and china it comes after recent rebukes by the u s against china for human rights abuses in hong kong u s president donald trump signed into law a bill that supports hong kong protesters and could place sanctions on any officials deemed responsible for human rights abuses and undermining hong kong s autonomy china s human rights abuses in its western region of xinjiang have seen the u s blacklist several of its companies its continued support of north korea has also drawn sanctions on a slew of companies doing business with the country these are just a few of the many penal economic measures the u s has taken against china the response from china has been consistently defiant telling the u s to stop interfering in china s internal affairs it has been a similar situation with u s russia relations the united states has not relented in sanctions imposed on russia after its illegal annexation of crimea interference with the 2016 u s presidential elections and the nerve agent attack on former russia spy sergei skripal president trump has also signed an order that blocks institutions such as the world bank from lending money to russia as a result there has been a decline in russian investment access to technology and economic growth according to the international monetary fund this could cause russia s economy to shrink by 10 percent instead of taking these economic consequences as cue to change their course however russia and china are trying to blunt the punitive measures by boosting their own mutually beneficial economic ties their comprehensive strategic partnership is designed partly to neutralize the punishments for their crimes china is now russia s number one trade partner displacing the united states sanctions excluding russia from u s dollar denominated markets have been offset by its relationship with china as the u s tries to stop iran from selling oil russia and china are helping iran skirt those efforts this is no accident graham t allison professor of government at the harvard kennedy school wrote emphasis added as u s pressure on russia grew with sanctions after russia s annexation of crimea and a diplomatic effort to isolate russia china opened its arms at every point the united states and western europeans imposed pain china has offered comfort when russian or chinese national security leaders think about current threats the specter they see is the united states of america they believe the united states is not only challenging their interests in eastern europe or the south china sea but is actively seeking to undermine their authoritarian regimes all of russia and china s actions annexation of foreign lands placing troops in disputed territories cyberattacks on foreign powers unlawful trade practices and human rights abuses are in the interest of building their power in order to topple the u s dominated international order that has brought relative stability to the world for decades they long to bring an end to that era which is why both these nations view the u s as an enemy and why they are coming together closer than ever this is what the trumpet and its predecessor the plain truth magazine have been proclaiming for decades a december 1959 plain truth issue wrote russia s program is not to take europe and to attack the united states first the communist program which our leaders should know calls first for the seizure of asia lenin wrote that the way to paris london and new york is via and delhi art of the communist plan to place india and pakistan in a giant vice between russia and china constant dream for centuries has been ultimate world conquest china knows however that in this highly industrialized age she can accomplish this dream only as an ally of russia china is now ready to begin devouring the rest of asia with russia s secret military backing this increasing level of collaboration has put russia and china on the path to military alliance indeed russia has recently begun helping china with weapons defenses the two nations have engaged in joint naval drills and exercises while continuously growing their military capabilities artyom lukin a researcher at the university in vladivostok said this could be the beginning of a de facto military alliance between russia and china as the only natural response to the united states as their common adversary in our booklet russia and china in prophecy we write that russia and china are working to form a new alliance and counter american dominance of world affairs america s dominance allows it to damage china s economy in a trade war and place devastating sanctions on russia this has caused these nations to come together to combat and work toward ending america s dominance for the purpose of establishing their own russia and china in prophecy continues share common philosophies economically politically and militarily and both have a common enemy in the west the way that china for decades counterbalanced russia s presence in asia benefited the united states geopolitically but that equation is changing as russia and china march toward a military alliance russian diplomats want to create a multipolar world and they know that the most expedient way to do so is to cement relations with their closest neighbor to the south the plain truth and the trumpet have been able to predict this alliance because of bible prophecy ezekiel 38 speaks of a powerful asian bloc of nations led by russia with china in a secondary position revelation 16 12 calls them the kings of the east an end time coalition with an army that numbers 200 million soldiers this power bloc will usher in a period

one side of the democratic party wants the nation s billionaires to pay a slightly higher tax rate on their income through an unprecedented wealth tax the other side would target the stock holdings real estate and other property of the nation s billionaires to raise trillions of dollars of new revenue one side has virtually no plans to have the government take over private industry the other has an armada of proposals for federal interventions spanning from government control of american health insurance to public production of prescription drugs to mandating worker control over their companies with democrats set to debate again this week the presidential primary has revealed a sharp split in the party over core tenets of american capitalism as the months long campaign has exposed disagreements about fundamental aspects of the nation s economic system advertisement the leading democratic presidential candidates have split into two camps with sens bernie sanders vt and elizabeth warren mass leading a liberal flank in the polling and former vice president joe biden and pete buttigieg the mayor of south bend ind leading the moderate side the eventual nominee will determine the party s position on the taxes paid by the richest americans the size of the federal welfare state the makeup of the health care industry and the relationship between workers and corporations among other vital economic questions the gap is so large that warren and sanders would spend up to 10 times as much as biden over the next 10 years and about eight times as much as buttigieg at the heart of this primary is a debate over the future of american capitalism said timothy naftali an associate professor of history at new york university advertisement the democratic party is trying to come to terms with where it stands on the kinds of issues warren and sanders raise on the tax system on debt and education on the nature of how we deliver health care he said these are big issues and sanders and warren are on one side and most of the other democrats appear to be on the other the jostling comes as president trump and white house officials have seized on recent economic news to argue that their agenda of low taxes reduced regulations and a shake up in trade policy has helped push the stock market and labor market to record levels the white house has tried to seize on the more liberal proposals emanating from the democratic primary and accuse trump s eventual rival of running on a platform of socialism sanders and warren have aggressively pushed this pretty far left agenda on the economy and biden has tried to run up the middle said stephen moore a conservative at the heritage foundation who advises trump but at the end of the day if you have a president biden or a president buttigieg with a democratic congress you could get much higher taxes a green new deal and a pretty aggressive step toward socialized medicine advertisement democrats say the recent spate of strong economic data overlooks the deeper economic suffering confronting broad swaths of the working class but their solutions to that suffering are markedly different adding up his various policy proposals sanders is calling for new federal spending that would amount to more than 50 trillion over the next decade a number about equal to one fifth of the entire u s economy over that time warren who has called herself a capitalist to my bones but agrees with many of sanders s policies is proposing upward of 30 trillion in new spending part of the difference between warren and sanders is she has a less costly estimate of what it would take to pay for expanding medicare to all americans his climate housing and student debt plans are also significantly bigger than hers by contrast buttigieg is proposing about 6 trillion in new federal spending over the next decade while biden has laid out how he would pay for about 3 trillion in spending over that time advertisement warren and sanders have also pushed a wealth tax that could raise more than 4 trillion taxing accumulated wealth and assets rather than the traditional democratic policy of taxing income biden released a significantly less aggressive tax plan earlier this month that would raise taxes on investors and firms a plan much closer to the position of the obama administration toward the end of his second term some academics said the current division on economic policy between the democratic party s leading presidential candidates may be wider than that between republican and democratic presidential candidates in recent general elections judging by their tax policies for instance sanders and biden are about 10 times further apart today than john mccain and barack obama were in the 2008 presidential campaign advertisement the last time a party faced such divergent paths may have been the 2016 gop primary when most republican candidates pledged a conventional approach to fiscal conservatism including entitlement cuts and free trade while trump promised to leave medicare and social security untouched and criticized trade agreements share this article share the democratic campaigns will continue to announce new economic policies biden s campaign for example is working on a trade policy aimed at seeking a contrast with trump by highlighting the former vice president s experience working with countries worldwide according to two people familiar with the campaign s internal planning and buttigieg aides are crafting a tax plan he is the only candidate in the top tier without one that would probably aim to tax the rich but not go as far as sanders and warren two other people said advertisement these diverging approaches reflect not only differences in the value of specific policies some experts say but also philosophical questions about the degree to which american capitalism requires massive federal intervention a central part of the divide includes divergent paths over how to reform the nation s welfare state with sanders and warren pushing for universal programs such as a medicare for all health care system and tuition free colleges and universities and sanders also calling for eliminating all student debt sanders has long pitched universal programs as generating greater political support and reducing administrative inefficiencies while buttigieg has critiqued the liberals plan for universal free college as benefiting the children of millionaires and billionaires sanders responded earlier this month by telling msnbc i m very glad that mr buttigieg is worried that i have been too easy on upper income people and the millionaires and billionaires advertisement the camps also split over the extent to which they target certain powerful financial interests with warren and sanders calling for significantly curbing the influence of actors such as wall street banks the fossil fuel industry private health insurance companies and the nation s approximately 750 billionaires part of the split with the moderates emerges from a belief among those on the left that the harm created by these special interests cannot be mitigated if their clout and influence over the political system is not significantly reduced both warren and sanders would make the democratic party a social democratic one it would really change the fundamental basis of the party said dean baker a left leaning economist who is supporting warren and called the primary without a doubt the starkest policy choice in democrats modern history advertisement if they get the nomination democrats would be proposing to make us look a lot like france or germany or even closer to some of the nordic countries but whereas there were vast differences between sanders and hillary clinton in the 2016 democratic primary that campaign turned more on questions of whether the party wanted to break with its establishment sanders and warren have in 2020 expanded the policy fight into additional spheres producing sweeping plans on antitrust regulation government production in key areas and worker control over corporate america warren for instance has called for breaking up silicon valley tech firms including amazon and google while sanders has released a broad antitrust policy that would establish new rules for breaking up monopolies warren began her campaign with a proposal that would create a government run drug producer to bring down pharmaceutical prices sanders last week announced a plan to create publicly owned internet providers and universal broadband access both liberals have called for giving workers some voting power over large corporations although sanders s would apply to many more companies and also give them a percentage of their stock holdings public ownership ideas have suddenly become core parts of the economic agenda said peter gowan an economic expert at the democracy collaborative a left leaning think tank we re not just talking about the welfare state now it s the welfare state plus plans to democratize the economy to some of the moderates defenders their approach represents a more pragmatic attempt to address some of the economy s bigger challenges quickly providing help to those who need it most rather than pursuing sweeping programs with little likelihood of being enacted in a divided political system some also view the sanders and warren plans as inadvisable either because they aim to raise taxes too steeply or would force americans to give up their private insurance it s not just about being realistic he just doesn t like the idea said one adviser to biden who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the campaign s thinking about the single payer plan we don t think you can raise 3 trillion a year in taxes it s absurd biden and buttigieg have also ridiculed the math of their opponents as overly optimistic and said the middle class would be hurt by the tax increases required in their large government expansions but they have also dismissed the idea that they are less concerned about the social crises in american life the distinction is between the economic issues on the minds of most americans and big transformative ideas that capture a primary voters attention but aren t great general election issues said andy slavitt a former health administrator who served in the obama administration or as sen amy klobuchar minn put it at the last debate i have bold ideas just because they re different than elizabeth s doesn t mean they re bold still there are signs that candidates are under pressure to make adjustments biden told cnbc earlier this month that he would support a new financial transaction tax on wall street his comments came one day after his campaign released tax proposals that rejected the idea

the canadian dollar celebrates inflation gains but some are looking to cash out and walk away image bank of canada reproduced under cc licensing cad advances on usd and gbp after inflation beat boc s core measures of inflation ticked higher in nov but gains limited by boc that s firmly on hold for now usd now main driver of cad cibc research shows cibc looks to cash out of bet on cad around 1 3050 the canadian dollar got the better of all its major rivals wednesday after being aided by a surprise increase in the bank of canada s boc preferred measures of inflation but some once bullish local analysts have said they intend to exit bets on the loonie ahead of anticipated weakness in 2020 statistics canada said wednesday that inflation fell 0 1 in november although the annualised rate of price growth remained steady at 2 2 however two of the boc s three preferred measures of inflation which are variants of core inflation rose last month and one of them by much more than was expected the boc s trimmed cpi measure rose from 2 1 to 2 2 in line with expectations last month while the median cpi jumped from 2 2 to 12 4 when markets were looking for an unchanged reading this saw the average of the three core measures creep higher from just under 2 1 to just under 2 2 all those numbers are above the 2 target of the boc and come hard on the heels of a quarter that saw the economy slow noticeably which may have led some to conclude that the boc will have little scope to justify following the lead of some counterparts by cutting canadian interest rates in the near future the jump in headline inflation in november was mostly due to base effects with energy prices having fallen sharply toward the end of 2018 says josh nye a senior economist at rbc capital markets we don t think today s inflation data ties the bank of canada s hands policymakers will likely be more influenced by next week s october gdp report which we think will set up for another quarter of sub trend growth in q4 that should leave the door open to a rate cut above canadian dollar performance vs major rivals on wednesday source pound sterling live markets care about inflation data because it s exactly these price pressures the boc is attempting to manipulate with its interest rate policy with hikes to the cash rate being deployed to ensure the consumer price index does not deviate meaningfully above the target while cuts to the benchmark for borrowing costs are used to ensure the price index doesn t fall too far below the target in subsequent years inflation is sensitive to growth and many other things the bank of canada sounded an almost hawkish tone earlier this month when it said it sees nascent evidence of a stabilisation in the global economy weakness of which has been a key driver of the bank s caution earlier this year it also noted stronger than expected business investment during the recent quarter before telling markets that inflation is still likely to average 2 over the next two years even if some months do yield above target increases boc policymakers will be watching consumer spending housing activity and business investment closely over the coming months for signs that those sources of economic resilience are coming under pressures from the global economic slowdown brought on the by the u s trade war with china markets had expected the boc to follow the fed and others by cutting rates soon rather than continuing to stand apart from the crowd but the december policy update suggests the boc is firmly in an on hold stance given we have less than a 33 chance of a cut priced in by year end 2020 we see asymmetry in buying the front end via bax march 21 contracts or 2s says andrew kelvin a bond market strategist at td securities above usd cad rate shown at 4 hour intervals deputy boc governor timothy lane told the ottawa board of trade this month the boc s apparent 2019 divergence from the fec has been overegged by the market and that canada can tread its own path as far as monetary policy is concerned that and the december statement have seen investors grow more confident that the boc will remain on hold for at least the foreseaable future which has lent support to the canadian dollar canada s dollar was again the best performing major currency of 2019 wednesday following steep losses for sterling which held the top spot for only a matter of weeks when fresh brexit related woes led the currency to hand all its post election gains back to the u s dollar euro and other rivals on tuesday boc rate policy and canadian economic outperformance have been key to the loonie s 2019 ascent but cibc capital markets says the u s dollar is now the most important driver of the outlook for the smaller dollar usd cad price action is not being driven by relative central bank expectations or the price of oil right now instead it s broad usd moves that matter says bipan rai cibc s north american head of fx strategy price action is trapped within the 1 30 1 3350 range we are playing this range for now and are tactically short usd cad looking to take profit at the 1 3050 mark we still expect usd cad to resolve higher over the long term above usd cad rate shown at daily intervals canada s dollar has traditionally had a number of different drivers with oil prices relative u s ca interest rate expectations and the direction of the s p 500 stock index normally vying with each other to be the dominant driver of flows however modelling work done by rai and the cibc team has found moves in the broad value of the u s dollar have slowly but surely become the most significant influence on canadian dollar direction in recent months the bank has been betting on a decline in the usd cad rate for weeks but is now looking to exit that bet around 1 3050 after having lowered its stop loss to just above the 1 32 level in order to lock in some profits from the trade however cibc is tipping a canadian dollar depreciation for 2020 and among the numerous reasons for that view is the expectation that the boc will after all cut canadian borrowing costs early next year investors and the canadian dollar are unprepared for a boc cut so such a thing could make waves in the market if one is announced pricing in the overnight index swap market implies the boc s cash rate will sit at 1 69 after the june 03 2020 meeting which is below the current 1 75 level but substantially above the 1 50 that would prevail in the wake of a typical 25 basis point cut given that we are bearish the usd as part of our reflation theme the above result is a risk to our view that the cad will underperform the usd still we do envisage that weaker incoming data will move the market to price in rate cuts from the boc next year that implies that front end spreads should return as the dominant driver for usd cad rai says in a note to clients
washington one side of the democratic party wants the nation s billionaires to pay a slightly higher tax rate on their income through an unprecedented wealth tax the other side would target the stock holdings real estate and other property of the nation s billionaires to raise trillions of dollars of new revenue one side has virtually no plans to have the government take over private industry the other has an armada of proposals for federal interventions spanning from government control of american health insurance to public production of prescription drugs to mandating worker control over their companies with democrats set to debate again this week the democratic presidential primary has revealed a sharp split in the party over core tenets of american capitalism as the months long campaign has exposed disagreements about fundamental aspects of the nation s economic system the leading democratic presidential candidates have split into two camps with sens bernie sanders of vermont and elizabeth warren of massachusetts leading a liberal flank in the polling and former vice president joe biden and pete buttigieg the mayor of south bend indiana leading the moderate side the eventual nominee will determine the party s position on the taxes paid by the richest americans the size of the federal welfare state the makeup of the health care industry and the relationship between workers and corporations among other vital economic questions the gap is so large that warren and sanders would spend up to 10 times as much as biden over the next 10 years and about eight times as much as buttigieg advertising at the heart of this primary is a debate over the future of american capitalism said timothy naftali an associate professor of history at new york university the democratic party is trying to come to terms with where it stands on the kinds of issues warren and sanders raise on the tax system on debt and education on the nature of how we deliver health care he said these are big issues and sanders and warren are on one side and most of the other democrats appear to be on the other the jostling comes as president donald trump and white house officials have seized on recent economic news to argue that their agenda of low taxes reduced regulations and a shake up in trade policy has helped push the stock market and labor market to record levels the white house has tried to seize on the more liberal proposals emanating from the democratic primary and accuse trump s eventual rival of running on a platform of socialism sanders and warren have aggressively pushed this pretty far left agenda on the economy and biden has tried to run up the middle said stephen moore a conservative at the heritage foundation who advises trump but at the end of the day if you have a president biden or a president buttigieg with a democratic congress you could get much higher taxes a green new deal and a pretty aggressive step toward socialized medicine democrats say the recent spate of strong economic data overlooks the deeper economic suffering confronting broad swaths of the working class but their solutions to that suffering are markedly different adding up his various policy proposals sanders is calling for new federal spending that would amount to more than 50 trillion over the next decade a number about equal to one fifth of the entire u s economy over that time warren who has called herself a capitalist to my bones but agrees with many of sanders s policies is proposing upward of 30 trillion in new spending part of the difference between warren and sanders is she has a less costly estimate of what it would take to pay for expanding medicare to all americans his climate housing and student debt plans are also significantly bigger than hers advertising by contrast buttigieg is proposing about 6 trillion in new federal spending over the next decade while biden has laid out how he would pay for about 3 trillion in spending over that time warren and sanders have also pushed a wealth tax that could raise more than 4 trillion taxing accumulated wealth and assets rather than the traditional democratic policy of taxing income biden released a significantly less aggressive tax plan earlier this month that would raise taxes on investors and firms a plan much closer to the position of the obama administration toward the end of his second term some academics said the current division on economic policy between the democratic party s leading presidential candidates may be wider than that between republican and democratic presidential candidates in recent general elections judging by their tax policies for instance sanders and biden are about 10 times further apart today than john mccain and barack obama were in the 2008 presidential campaign the last time a party faced such divergent paths may have been the 2016 gop primary when most republican candidates pledged a conventional approach to fiscal conservatism including entitlement cuts and free trade while trump promised to leave medicare and social security untouched and criticized trade agreements the democratic campaigns will continue to announce new economic policies biden s campaign for example is working on a trade policy aimed at seeking a contrast with trump by highlighting the former vice president s experience working with countries worldwide according to two people familiar with the campaign s internal planning advertising and buttigieg aides are crafting a tax plan he is the only candidate in the top tier without one that would probably aim to tax the rich but not go as far as sanders and warren two other people said these diverging approaches reflect not only differences in the value of specific policies some experts say but also philosophical questions about the degree to which american capitalism requires massive federal intervention a central part of the divide includes divergent paths over how to reform the nation s welfare state with sanders and warren pushing for universal programs such as a medicare for all health care system and tuition free colleges and universities and sanders also calling for eliminating all student debt sanders has long pitched universal programs as generating greater political support and reducing administrative inefficiencies while buttigieg has critiqued the liberals plan for universal free college as benefiting the children of millionaires and billionaires sanders responded earlier this month by telling msnbc i m very glad that mr buttigieg is worried that i have been too easy on upper income people and the millionaires and billionaires the camps also split over the extent to which they target certain powerful financial interests with warren and sanders calling for significantly curbing the influence of actors such as wall street banks the fossil fuel industry private health insurance companies and the nation s approximately 750 billionaires part of the split with the moderates emerges from a belief among those on the left that the harm created by these special interests cannot be mitigated if their clout and influence over the political system is not significantly reduced advertising both warren and sanders would make the democratic party a social democratic one it would really change the fundamental basis of the party said dean baker a left leaning economist who is supporting warren and called the primary without a doubt the starkest policy choice in democrats modern history if they get the nomination democrats would be proposing to make us look a lot like france or germany or even closer to some of the nordic countries but whereas there were vast differences between sanders and hillary clinton in the 2016 democratic primary that campaign turned more on questions of whether the party wanted to break with its establishment sanders and warren have in 2020 expanded the policy fight into additional spheres producing sweeping plans on antitrust regulation government production in key areas and worker control over corporate america warren for instance has called for breaking up silicon valley tech firms including amazon and google while sanders has released a broad antitrust policy that would establish new rules for breaking up monopolies warren began her campaign with a proposal that would create a government run drug producer to bring down pharmaceutical prices sanders last week announced a plan to create publicly owned internet providers and universal broadband access both liberals have called for giving workers some voting power over large corporations although sanders s would apply to many more companies and also give them a percentage of their stock holdings public ownership ideas have suddenly become core parts of the economic agenda said peter gowan an economic expert at the democracy collaborative a left leaning think tank we re not just talking about the welfare state now it s the welfare state plus plans to democratize the economy advertising to some of the moderates defenders their approach represents a more pragmatic attempt to address some of the economy s bigger challenges quickly providing help to those who need it most rather than pursuing sweeping programs with little likelihood of being enacted in a divided political system some also view the sanders and warren plans as inadvisable either because they aim to raise taxes too steeply or would force americans to give up their private insurance it s not just about being realistic he just doesn t like the idea said one adviser to biden who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the campaign s thinking about the single payer plan we don t think you can raise 3 trillion a year in taxes it s absurd biden and buttigieg have also ridiculed the math of their opponents as overly optimistic and said the middle class would be hurt by the tax increases required in their large government expansions but they have also dismissed the idea that they are less concerned about the social crises in american life the distinction is between the economic issues on the minds of most americans and big transformative ideas that capture a primary voters attention but aren t great general election issues said andy slavitt a former health administrator who served in the obama administration advertising or as minnesota sen amy klobuchar put it at the last debate i have bold ideas just because they re different than elizabeth s doesn t mean they re bold still there are signs that candidates are under pressure to make adjustments biden told cnbc earlier this month that he would support a new financial transaction tax on wall street his comments came one day after his campaign released tax proposals that rejected the idea if one side wins it s economic disruption in advantage of the people with the losers being billionaires and defense contractors said alex lawson president of social security works a liberal group and if the other side wins it s less clear but it probably looks basically similar to how it looks now but without trump

by william anderson a decade ago democrat politicians and their cultural and academic allies were singing the praises of hugo chávez and his economic miracle in venezuela from bernie sanders to salon to joseph stiglitz and sean penn chávez s version of socialism had transformed venezuela lifted up the poor and set an example for the united states and latin america today venezuela takes its rightful place with the left in the orwellian memory hole sanders no longer brings it up on the campaign trail stiglitz has not made a public comment on the venezuelan economy or chávez s successor nicolás maduro the left either claims that venezuela never really tried real socialism yahoo finance or simply pretends that the country and its brutal kleptocracy are nonexistent or at best irrelevant to the latest collectivist policies being thrown out by democrat politicians yet neither venezuela nor its policies are irrelevant in us politics on the contrary they are the staple of some candidates running for the presidential nomination of the democratic party their proposals are much closer to the chávez maduro variety of socialism than any of them or their media allies are willing to admit while they insist that they want to create a new denmark what they are fashioning is a domestic version of the latest latin american tragedy to understand why this is so we first need a refresher course on what has happened in venezuela first chávez directed almost all his political rhetoric toward poor people in the country and against those who were wealthy now it is important to remember that latin america has had much greater contrasts between wealth and poverty than what we generally see in the united states and europe the classical liberalism that encouraged free trade and produced the open economy in the usa did not take root south of the border the economies in latin america historically have been much more highly regulated and more protectionist than what has been the case in this country and that means fewer economic opportunities for the masses this fact has not kept socialists from claiming that latin american countries practice untrammeled free enterprise and so politicians there with encouragement from the american left have maintained that authoritarian socialism is necessary to narrow the standard of living gap between rich and poor in those nations in the case of venezuela the chávez government nationalized the oil industry not an insignificant thing given that venezuela sits upon the world s largest reserves of crude oil venezuela hardly is the only country with a government owned oil sector the oil producing facilities of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec nations all are state owned as is norway s petroleum producing sector whatever the inefficiencies of socialism in the energy sectors however the people running the nationalized oil industries at least have had the foresight to maintain a workable capital stock drilling and transportation of crude oil is highly capital intensive which means that a sizable portion of oil revenues must be plowed back into working capital in order to keep the oil fields productive chávez had different and more delusional ideas about how to run venezuela s newly nationalized oil industry first like the cartoon version of the latin american dictator he replaced much of the private workforce with political cronies which guaranteed that the industry would be poorly managed second he spent oil revenues for political purposes ostensibly to build schools and hospitals as the narrative goes and his spending spree somehow drastically reduced the nation s rate of poverty there is some truth to the idea that at the beginning vast wealth transfers will make the recipients better off but this always is temporary because the productive individuals and industrial sectors having their assets confiscated will not go on producing at the same high level in the case of the venezuelan oil boom chávez s scheme had its inevitable meeting with reality at first the vast wealth transfers did make some people better off in part because the nation had enormous oil revenues and oil prices were at historically high levels around the world however even then the oil money was not enough to cover the chávez spending spree and his government resorted to what latin american dictators from central casting always do print money and lots of it the high oil prices did not last and venezuela saw a combination of falling prices and falling production as capital equipment in the neglected oil fields wore out and oil revenues dropped precipitously that meant even more money printing and burgeoning hyperinflation to go with it as one would expect from the cartoonish chávez who mercifully would die of cancer and leave his government in the hands of the even more thuggish maduro but what does that have to do with the platforms of bernie sanders elizabeth warren and other democrats after all while they talk of democratic socialism none are calling for anything that seems to be as radical as anything done in venezuela but guess again their platforms are closer to those of chávez and maduro than they will admit the venezuelan authorities seized the assets of oil companies and other firms and then spent their revenues on things not related to the businesses his supporters say that chávez s government built hospitals and schools providing services for poor people that in return provided chávez his votes as pointed out before whatever chávez and maduro did with the oil revenues was not sustainable because the government failed to maintain the capital and oil prices fell drastically leaving the government to print money the rest is very sad history other than sanders no candidate has called for directly nationalizing the oil and gas industries although warren and sanders have called for shutting down at least some fuel production and it is clear that they would like the industry to disappear altogether with windmills and solar energy providing the bulk of us energy thus whatever income equality schemes they have planned using oil revenues is not one of them sanders has promised to provide five years of pay and benefits for energy workers that lose their jobs under his energy or lack of energy plan instead of milking the oil industry for political cash sanders and warren have found what they believe to be an eternal source of revenue the wealth of american billionaires through proposed wealth taxes and other acts of property confiscation warren and sanders seem to believe that they can fund trillions of dollars in new programs seizing the assets of people like bill gates and jeff bezos and turning them into new revenue that would work economic miracles elsewhere declared sanders say bill gates was actually taxed 100 billion we could end homelessness and provide safe drinking water to everyone in this country bill would still be a multibillionaire while warren hasn t made the claim that confiscating most of gates s wealth would end homelessness and provide clean water for the nation she has made a big deal of the fact that the proposed tax would only be two cents on the dollar but also would accomplish all sorts of wonderful things i will deal with sanders s claims later if the facebook posts by my progressive friends are accurate a small number of billionaires controls most of the wealth in the world and this tiny cadre of people is hoarding all the money and leaving everyone else in the world out in the cold while this might seem like a cause for action there is much that the progressives warren sanders and their economist allies are not saying and what is left out is the most important thing contrary to what one reads in the new york times or the nation people like jeff bezos are not hoarding anything and they certainly are not creating poverty according to economists thomas piketty and gabriel zucman among others capital owners receive increasing returns on their investment and so as their businesses grow they gain an increasing share of the proceeds leaving workers and everyone else out in the cold getting beyond all the numbers that these economists are presenting there is a logical construct that must be satisfied for their claims to be true if they are correct then over the past two decades which have seen exponential growth in web based enterprises and the rise of billionaire fortunes we would expect to see a corresponding number of people around the world slide off into poverty after all if bill gates and jeff bezos are gobbling up all the wealth and income then there would be a constantly decreasing amount for everyone else which only can mean that the rest of the world is getting poorer there is no other possible outcome yet that is not what we have seen over the past two decades poverty rates worldwide have fallen not risen the numbers are irrefutable and more important if they are true then warren and sanders along with their supporting economists are wrong even warren and sanders however recognize that most billionaires are not receiving these huge sums of money as cash income the way the rest of us receive paychecks instead they seem to understand that the vast holdings of billionaires are in non cash assets such as stocks or property furthermore getting an accurate and timely assessment of those assets would be difficult to put it mildly zucman and others have said that governments simply can seize the assets like stock holdings and sell them on open markets and in their view make the markets more efficient which would is a heroic assumption getting beyond the practicality of such taxation there is the problem of the assumption behind it governments would gain new tax revenues but the economic behavior of the people being taxed would not change one has to understand how someone like bezos gained his wealth in the first place before he founded amazon in 1994 using 300 000 he received from his parents he had other tech jobs but hardly commanded anything close to his current wealth amazon he told other investors was a huge risk and he warned them that it had maybe a 30 percent chance of success like so many other internet startups from that era it took a long time for amazon to turn a profit but when many of the dot com companies imploded at the turn of this century amazon managed to survive not that long ago the wealth that amazon currently represents did not exist we are speaking of a firm that is only twenty five years old google is younger than that and in its early days was up for sale for less than a million dollars these companies and many like them grew and thrived because they provided something of value for their customers and clients this last point is important because to listen to the political rhetoric coming from sanders and warren one would think that people like bezos and gates raided everyone else s bank accounts and unexplainably managed to hoard the money for themselves neither of these candidates seem to have a clue that the asset values of these billionaire portfolios have come from entrepreneurial activity in which these people risked their own personal wealth to build companies that had no guarantee of success what these political candidates and their economist supporters seem to believe however is that if they seize huge assets from these people 1 they easily can convert them into cash without destroying their value and 2 their actions will not have any negative effect on the creation of wealth so that every year these billionaires and their companies will continue to fill the government coffers full of cash paying for every political promise one can imagine earlier in this article i pointed out sanders s assertion that if he could confiscate more than 90 percent of bill gates s assets the result would be no more homeless people living on the streets and clean water for all americans the causality chain is murky to say the least and sanders does not explain how his plan would work or how it would get people off the streets and clean up the nation s drinking supply apparently he assumes that such things are self evident but the government has been throwing billions and billions of dollars at these issues for years and homeless people seem to be increasing especially in the places that progressives govern besides performing all sorts of government financed wonders warren and sanders seem to believe that those being taxed would not change their behaviors and that confiscating large amounts of assets from growing firms would have zero effect on business growth the closest analogy i can find is from the cult film animal house in which the band marches into the wall i am sure that sanders and warren would respond that they would issue threats against the firms and anyone trying to change their wealth status as though one can build wealth through threats of government punishment like chávez and maduro who believed that the oil revenues would last forever warren and sanders believe that they have found their fountain of funding the confiscation of billionaires assets and like chávez and maduro they seem to believe that american businesses would continue to grow that entrepreneurs would pretend that the government didn t regard them as public enemy number one and that their taxation schemes would provide lots of funding for free healthcare education and much more the oil revenue stream in fact did run dry or nearly so but the flood of new programs and benefits was still there including the new hospitals and the like as we know the chávez maduro regime simply printed money and lots of it but paper money was not a replacement for real assets and we know the rest of the story the vaunted new hospital construction became the hospitals with no medicine consumer goods disappeared from the shelves as did basic food items all that was left was the inflation and the memories of a better time likewise whatever new flood of programs sanders and warren would fund through mass confiscation of private assets would not last very long before the funding dried up of course one can imagine that they would take the maduro option blame capitalism and print money such points are obvious and should be obvious to anyone capable of logical thinking that so many voters pundits academics and media figures are taken in by the warren sanders schemes does not bode well for our economic and political future destroying wealth makes us poorer not wealthier and if american voters are not able to understand that simple point they will find out the hard way but they will find out whether or not they understand why the calamity has hit them is another issue altogether as american voters seem increasingly determined to vote for politicians who can create the biggest fantasies this was published on

british prime minister boris johnson has given jeremy corbyn a good old fashioned thumping the conservatives won 365 seats out of 650 in parliament gaining 47 they smashed the red wall of solid labour seats in northern england the johnson led conservatives achieved the highest vote swing since world war ii in a typical british irony old mining towns reposed their trust in an old etonian over a dyed in wool socialist 360 context britain faces a historic election read more on december 10 this author took the view that the tories would be back in power because they seemed to have the most loyal flock that view has been vindicated resoundingly the labour party is in complete disarray corbyn has been weighed measured and found wanting while he has promised to step down he has failed to resign unlike his predecessors in defeat a full scale civil war has broken out in the labour party in the words of ian murray the only labour mp from scotland this party must listen and this party must respond or this party will die from new labour to the left to be fair labour has problems that go beyond corbyn the new labour that tony blair and gordon brown created lost its sheen with the iraq war of 2003 and the global financial crisis of 2007 08 both blair and brown were margaret thatcher s political children one of them emulated her falklands adventure by taking the uk into intervention in kosovo sierra leone and iraq the other followed the iron lady s big bang reforms with light touch regulation of the city of london both iraq and light touch ended up in disasters many in the labour party were deeply uncomfortable with blair s imperial militarism and brown s financial capitalism they saw both these leaders making a faustian pact with mephistopheles for the proverbial kiss with helen they were both seduced by power and reneged on principles that labour once held dear once brown lost in 2010 the old guard mounted a comeback first ed miliband beat his blairite brother david to become the party leader then corbyn won the labour leadership election in 2015 marking a major lurch to the left corbyn was an unlikely leader of the labour party in the blair and brown years labour had turned staunchly european yet it is important to remember that labour campaigned against joining the european economic community eec in the 1975 referendum thanks to the maastricht treaty the eec became the european union in 1993 corbyn was a part of that labour campaign even as thatcher and the tories argued to join the eec it took neil kinnock to modernize labour and turn it into a pro european party yet euroskeptic elements remained corbyn was one of them suspicions abound that he remains opposed to the eu and is a closet brexiteer corbyn certainly did not campaign to remain in the european union with much energy or enthusiasm in 2016 in the general election on december 12 2019 his position on brexit was a fudge that tried to reconcile the tension between blairites who have sworn an oath of fealty to the eu and working class supporters who voted for brexit faced with the crystal clarity of johnson s message get brexit done corbyn s fudge melted spectacularly corbyn s authoritarian leadership style lack of nimbleness and terrible public speaking ensured that he was not seen as prime ministerial material accusations of anti semitism dogged the labour party under his tenure corbyn s front bench lacked both experience and talent even traditional labour voters lost faith in their party s leadership and switched sides to the once hated tories unless the labour party elects a charismatic leader who unifies warring factions and crafts a modern message it will spend a decade or more in opposition the rest of the opposition the liberal democrats cast off with great hopes during the election unfortunately their ship has rammed into the rocks young leader jo swinson lost her own seat and promptly resigned she lacked the intellectual ballast or silver tongue to be a match for johnson and her claim to be a prime ministerial candidate smacked of hubris swinson s bet on opposing brexit and reversing the result of the 2016 referendum did not cut ice with voters the liberal democrats did split the vote and helped the tories achieve victory this led columnist simon jenkins to argue that the party is an anachronistic political spoiler that should disband on current trends the liberal democrats are destined to stay in the doldrums for the next few years this election was also notable for the reduced relevance of the democratic unionist party dup and nigel farage s brexit party the conservatives no longer need the former in the house of commons and have sucked oxygen from farage s mob the dup s loss to unionists and republicans has long term implications a majority in northern ireland has voted for parties that favor union with ireland putting the unity of the uk at risk in fact television programs and numerous pundits are pontificating about the break up of the uk the scottish national party snp won 48 of the 59 seats in scotland if johnson has the mandate in england nicola sturgeon has the backing of scotland during the 2014 scottish independence referendum the uk was part of the eu during the brexit referendum scots voted to remain in the eu sturgeon is making a credible argument that scotland cannot be imprisoned in the uk against its will she has sounded the clarion call for another independence referendum by declaring that the will of the scottish people cannot be ignored the union of england and scotland of 1707 vintage is certainly at risk and the tories what is not at risk is the future of the conservative party the natural party of power has reinvented itself yet again some members of johnson s team are bullish about life outside the eu they are already plotting to attract the insurance market from hong kong to london as the asian metropolis suffers from incessant protests that are making business onerous if not impossible they want london to be a singapore style safe haven for capital from around the world unconstrained by eu rules like singapore they want the uk to invest in public infrastructure state schools and the national health service nhs apart from a supply side boost there is a demand side policy too brexit will enable tories to ease pressure on public services and scarce resources by curbing immigration dominic cummings the svengali figure in johnson s team is now the dominant intellectual force in british politics after shifting politics to the right he plans to shift economic policy to the left and steal labour s clothes leaving the opposition naked for the next election or two andrew sullivan a former president of the oxford union who knew johnson in those days recently wrote an article on the prime minister s blundering brilliance the pied piper has managed to engage and co opt rather than dismiss and demonize the brexit discontent in a little watched video cummings spoke about the strategy the tories followed to do so as per johnson s strategist the eu project was driving the growth of extremism and brexit will drain the poison of a lot of political debates all four of cummings s grandparents served in world war ii for all his faults this shadowy figure genuinely cares about schools hospitals and the working class johnson might be a cavalier but as sullivan observes he can connect with people from other backgrounds he was successful as mayor of london and won a second term in a city with a natural labour majority unlike david cameron and george osborne johnson never believed in austerity and opposed kosovo style social cleansing of the poor in london as prime minister he is promising higher public spending and lower taxes while acting tough on crime terrorism and immigration in fact cummings and johnson might be about to move the tories and the uk away from its thatcherite roots if they do so successfully the uk might have a good shot at staying united what happens to the eu make no mistake johnson s emphatic victory is terrible news for the european union the eurozone economy is in trouble it is experiencing anemic growth and high unemployment productivity is stubbornly refusing to rise in fact the contradictions of a single currency are threatening to derail the entire european project there is a strong argument to be made that greece and germany should not have the same currency they are far too different from one another the same monetary policy for the two countries does both of them a disservice exacerbating existing imbalances even as the euro currency creates new tensions the sovereign debt crisis is straining common bonds the europeans and the international monetary fund might have bailed out greece with its economy a little over 300 billion italy with its economy of about 2 trillion and a debt gdp ratio of more than 130 is too big for anyone to bail out german taxpayers are going to balk at the bill instead of honestly tackling its financial crisis europe has elected to take the extend and pretend approach of prolonging payment timetables and believing in the fiction that countries like greece or italy will pay back their debts instead europe has been practicing socialism for the financial sector and austerity for everyone else naturally this is causing resentment in italy matteo salvini rose to power on the basis of public anger against brussels countries such as poland and hungary are also rocking the eu boat even in france and germany euroskeptic parties are on the rise the democratic deficit in brussels does not help neither does the red tape while some european officials are outstanding many are utterly inefficient if not corrupt brussels is simply too removed from marseille or munich and europeans still do not feel an emotional connection with it if johnson and cummings pull off a successful brexit centrifugal tendencies in europe will increase italy might join the uk in opting to leave the eu and so might other countries if that happens johnson would be a modern day henry viii he would have taken back control from brussels just as the portly 16 century king threw off the yoke of rome brexit might seem like yet another case of british pluck foresight and cunning of course europeans could come together to form a closer union a fiscal union might emerge to complement its monetary union structural reforms might resolve its contradictions yet that seems unlikely in the short run at least the eu will suffer what happens to the us in the us commentators often compare johnson to president donald trump johnson s victory has sent shivers down liberals and enthused conservatives both are drawing their own lessons roger cohen sounded the bugle in the new york times and warned that trump could win in 2020 in a rambling piece he called brexit a national tragedy and asserted that the triumph of emotion over reason in the age of facebook queers the pitch for the likes of johnson and trump cohen s comparison is superficial and does johnson a disservice johnson may be a lying scoundrel but he is no trump jon sopel of the bbc also got in on the act he warned democrats against choosing bernie sanders or elizabeth warren who might be american counterparts of corbyn he pointed out that blair won a third term despite voters seeing him as smarmy george w bush s poodle in the pocket of big business and a war criminal corbyn lost despite promising more money for nhs nationalization of key industries and free broadband for everyone the fact that working class workers turned their backs on labour in a class divided society is a key lesson for democrats the green new deal and the medicare for all plan might smack of socialism bigger government and higher taxes are not easy sells in anglo saxon lands in the us socialism is a dirty word and democrats could gift the election to trump by flirting with it on fox news cal thomas argued that johnson s victory is similar to thatcher s triumph in 1979 it presages a second term for trump just as the iron lady paved the path for ronald reagan the news headlines social media chatter and liberal outrage will be trumped by a booming economy soaring stock markets and healthy job numbers in 2016 the vote for brexit was followed by a mandate for trump the 2020 presidential election is some way off and these commentators might be premature in their predictions the immediate item on the agenda for both countries is a us uk trade deal johnson and cummings plan to wrap up trade deals around the world and strengthen their hand against the eu they will be bending their backs to get a trade deal done by next year they might have an ally in the white house trump is embroiled in impeachment proceedings he has been a vocal supporter of brexit and an opponent of the european project a trade deal with the uk will take away attention from the proceedings and spite eu bigwigs in an election year it would make for good political theater waving a great trade deal around might bolster trump s image in the eyes of his supporters anglo saxon democracies have much in common and johnson s victory will inevitably affect politics across the pond the views expressed in this article are the author s own and do not necessarily reflect fair observer s editorial policy

quarter and annual results i would like to take a moment and thank all of heico s team members we are proud to lead some of the hardest working and most successful professionals in our industry i take great pride in saying that the combination of our exceptional workforce and their entrepreneurial culture has been a winning formula for heico and has undoubtedly enabled us to achieve a 29 year compound annual growth rate of 16 in net sales 19 in net income and 24 in our stock price now i d like to take a few minutes to summarize the highlights of our record fourth quarter and full fiscal year results consolidated fourth quarter fiscal 19 net sales of 541 5 million operating income of 120 6 million and net income of 85 7 million all represent record results driven principally by strong double digit organic growth within flight support and mid single digit organic growth within etg and the impact of our fiscal 19 acquisitions consolidated fiscal 19 net sales of 2 055 6 million operating income of 457 1 million and net income of 327 9 million also represent record results driven mainly by our robust double digit organic growth within both of our operating segments as well as the excellent operating performance of our fiscal 19 acquisitions consolidated net income and operating income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 are up 27 and 16 respectively on a 14 increase in net sales consolidated operating margin improved to 22 3 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 and that was up from 21 7 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 18 consolidated net income and operating income in fiscal year 2019 are up 26 and 21 respectively on a 16 increase in net sales consolidated operating margin improved to 22 2 in fiscal 19 and that was up one full point from 21 2 in fiscal 18 consolidated net income per diluted share increased 27 to 0 62 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 and that was up from 0 49 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 18 and consolidated net income per diluted share increased 26 to 2 39 in fiscal 19 that was up from 1 90 in fiscal 18 the etg group set an all time quarterly net sales record in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 increasing 15 over the fourth quarter of fiscal 18 and that resulted from the excellent operating performance of the fiscal 19 acquisitions as well as strong demand for our defense related products flight support also set all time quarterly net sales records in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 increasing 12 over the fourth quarter of fiscal 18 and that principally reflects strong double digit organic growth within our aftermarket repair and overhaul services as well as our replacement parts product lines cash flow provided by operating activities increased 33 to a record 437 4 million in fiscal 19 and that was up from 328 5 million in fiscal 2018 cash flow provided by operating activities increased 9 to 124 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and that was up from 113 7 million fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as you all can see we continue to generate significant cash flow for our shareholders by remaining focused on developing niche products and our strategic commitment to highly decentralized and efficient entrepreneurial structure as we reported yesterday the board of directors declared an 0 08 per share regular semiannual cash dividend on both classes of stock and this is payable on january 23 2020 to shareholders of record of january 9 2020 the cash dividend represents a 14 increase over the prior semiannual per share amount of 0 07 the cash dividend was our 83rd consecutive semiannual cash dividend since 1979 the increased dividend confirms our confidence in continued strong cash flow heico s consistent growth strategies and our desire to continue rewarding shareholders while at the same time retaining sufficient capital to fund internal growth as well as acquisitions in september our db control subsidiary acquired all of the outstanding stock of ttt cubed a designer and manufacturer of radio frequency sources detectors and controllers for certain defense applications db control is part of our etg group and we expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following its closing yesterday we announced the acquisition of 80 1 of the stock of quell corporation which designs and manufactures emi rfi and transient protection solutions for a very wide variety of connectors that principally serve customers within the aerospace and defense markets quell is part of our etg group and we expect the acquisition also to be accretive to earnings within the first 12 months following closing in october 19 our dukane seacom subsidiary received faa tso certifications for their special underwater locator beacon and low lithium battery and we are pleased to achieve these certifications this particular product which we call dk290 builds on seacom s product legacy and simplified shipping and handling processes with a lower lithium content and in december 19 our vpt subsidiary earned the military aerospace electronics innovators awards platinum recognition for their gallium nitride based dc to dc converters this distinction is an important one and is the military aerospace electronics innovators highest honor and recognizes companies in the aerospace and defense electronics industries which have made groundbreaking contributions and innovative solutions to solve design challenges as always we thank vpt and their incredibly capable management for the outstanding accomplishment and we are really humbled by their persistent excellence in innovation and just a comment that the management and the people of vpt are some of the most unusually talented individuals but that s not exceptional for heico because we have these people operating companies throughout our system they are the ones that make heico successful at this time i would like to introduce eric mendelson co president of heico and president of heico s flight support group and he will discuss the results of the flight support group eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group thank you the flight support group s net sales increased 12 to a record 324 7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 up from 290 3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 18 the flight support group s net sales increased 13 to a record 1 240 2 million in fiscal year 19 up from 1 097 9 million in fiscal 18 the increases in the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 19 are attributable to strong organic growth of 12 and 13 respectively mainly due to increased demand and new product offerings across all of our product line the flight support group s operating income increased 14 to 62 2 million in the first in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 up from 54 6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 18 this increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and the favorable impact from the changes in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent consideration partially offset by a decrease in gross profit margin mainly reflecting a slightly less favorable product mix within our specialty products product line the flight support group s operating income increased 17 to a record 242 million in fiscal year 2019 up from 206 6 million in fiscal year 18 which resulted mainly from the previously mentioned net sales growth and improved gross profit margin mainly attributable to higher net sales of our aftermarket replacement parts and efficiencies realized from the net sales growth the flight support group s operating margin increased to 19 2 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 up from 18 8 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 18 principally reflecting the previously mentioned changes in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent consideration partially offset by a slightly less favorable gross profit margin the flight support group s operating margin increased to 19 5 in fiscal year 19 up from 18 8 in fiscal year 18 principally reflecting the previously mentioned improved gross profit margin and efficiencies realized from the net sales growth with respect to fiscal year 20 we are estimating net sales growth of approximately 7 to 8 over the prior year and the full year flight support group operating margin to approximate 19 5 to 20 further we estimate mid to high single digit organic growth in fiscal 20 these estimates exclude additional acquired businesses if any now i would like to introduce victor mendelson co president of heico and president of heico s electronic technologies group to discuss the results of the electronic technologies group victor h mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of electronic technologies group thank you eric the electronic technologies group s net sales increased 15 to a record 219 5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 up from 191 1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 18 which is attributable to the favorable impact from our fiscal 19 acquisitions as well as organic growth of 4 mainly due to increased demand for our defense products the electronic technologies group s net sales increased 19 to a record 834 5 million in fiscal 19 up from 701 8 million in fiscal 18 as a result of 10 organic growth mainly due to increased demand for certain defense and aerospace products and the impact from our fiscal 19 acquisitions the electronic technologies group s operating income increased 13 to 64 6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 up from 57 1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 18 principally reflecting the previously mentioned net sales growth partially offset by higher acquisition related expenses the electronic technologies group s operating income increased 20 to a record 245 7 million in fiscal 19 up from 204 5 million in fiscal 18 this increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and an improved gross profit margin mainly driven by increased net sales and a more favorable product mix for certain defense products and efficiencies realized from the net sales growth partially offset by higher performance based compensation expense and higher acquisition related costs the electronic technologies group s operating margin remained strong at 29 4 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 compared to 29 9 as reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 18 the operating margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 is inclusive of the higher acquisition related costs associated with a recent acquisition which negatively impacted the current period operating margin by approximately 0 4 had we not incurred these additional costs the fourth quarter fiscal 19 operating margin would have been consistent with the fourth quarter fiscal 18 operating margin the electronic technologies group s operating margin improved to 29 4 in fiscal 19 up from 29 1 in fiscal 18 which resulted mainly from an improved gross profit margin partially offset by increased sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales inclusive of higher acquisition related costs and higher performance based compensation expense with respect to fiscal 19 we are estimating net sales growth of approximately 5 to 6 over the prior year and anticipate the full year electronic technologies group s operating margin to approximate 28 to 29 further we estimate low to mid single digit organic growth in fiscal 20 which could be higher in fiscal 20 depending on us defense spending allocations these estimates exclude any additional acquired businesses if any i ll turn the call back over to larry mendelson laurans a mendelson chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you victor moving on consolidated net income per diluted share increased 27 to 0 62 in the first quarter of fiscal 19 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 and that was up from 0 49 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 18 diluted earnings per share increased 26 in the fiscal year to 2 39 and that was up from 1 90 in fiscal year 18 and these increases reflect the very strong operating performance within both segments flight support and etg depreciation and amortization expense totaled 21 8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 that was up from 19 7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 18 and totaled 83 5 million in fiscal 19 and that was up from 77 million in fiscal 18 the increase in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 19 principally reflects the incremental impact of higher depreciation and amortization expense of intangible assets from our fiscal 19 acquisitions r d expense increased 7 to 17 9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 that was up from 16 8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 18 and it increased 16 to 66 6 million in fiscal year 19 and that was up from 57 5 million in fiscal 18 significant new ongoing product development efforts are continuing as usual at both flight support and etg and we continue to invest approximately 3 of each sales dollar into new product development consolidated sg a expense was at 88 8 million and 82 8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 and fiscal 18 respectively due principally to the impact of fiscal 19 and 18 acquisitions and that was partially offset by a favorable change in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent consideration consolidated sg a expenses were 356 7 million and 314 5 million in fiscal 19 and fiscal 18 respectively due principally to the impact of fiscal 19 and 18 acquisitions as well as higher performance based compensation expense and changes in the estimated fair value of accrued contingent consideration consolidated sg a expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to 16 4 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 down about 1 from 17 4 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 18 and this is mainly attributable to favorable changes in estimated fair value of accrued contingent consideration consolidated sg a expense as a percent of net sales decreased to 17 4 in fiscal 19 down slightly from 17 7 in fiscal 18 which is mainly attributable to efficiencies realized from net sales growth i think everybody on the call can understand that as we grow our business we are in effect shrinking the sg a expense so it s a very beneficial increase in our performance interest expense was 5 2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 that was compared to 5 1 million in fourth quarter of fiscal 18 and 21 7 million in fiscal 19 compared to 19 9 million in fiscal 18 the increase in fiscal 19 was principally due to higher interest rates partially offset by a lower weighted average balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility other income and expense in the fourth quarter and fiscal 18 and 19 was not significant so we won t comment on it income taxes our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 decreased to 19 8 compared to 24 9 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 18 and this decrease principally reflects the favorable impact of higher tax exempt unrealized gains in the cash surrender values of life insurance policies related to the heico corporate leadership compensation plan as well as the reduction in the federal tax rate from a blended rate of 23 3 in fiscal 18 down to 21 in fiscal 19 our effective tax rate in fiscal 19 decreased to 17 8 from 19 8 in fiscal 18 and the decrease is mainly attributable to the reduction in the federal tax rate from a blended rate of 23 3 in fiscal 18 to 21 in fiscal 19 the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal 19 also reflects a 14 3 million larger tax benefit in fiscal 19 from stock option exercises compared to fiscal 18 partially offset by the net impact of certain discrete tax benefits recorded in fiscal 18 the provisions of the tax act that became effective for heico in fiscal 19 did not have a material net effect on the company s effective tax rate net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was 6 9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 compared to 6 7 million in fourth quarter of 18 fiscal 18 net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was 31 8 million in fiscal 19 compared to 26 5 million in fiscal 18 the increase in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019 reflects improved operating results of certain of our flight support group and etg subsidiaries in which non controlling interests are held for the full fiscal 20 we estimate a combined effective tax rate and noncontrolling interest rate of 19 to 20 of pre tax income now moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow our financial position and forecasted cash flow remain very strong as we discussed earlier cash flow provided by operating activities was very strong and increased 33 to a record 437 4 million in fiscal 19 and that was up from 328 5 million in fiscal 18 cash flow provided by operating activities increased 9 to 124 million in fourth quarter of fiscal 19 and that also was up from 113 7 million in fourth quarter of fiscal 18 our working capital ratio was 2 8 times and 2 6 times as of october 31 19 and 18 respectively dsos days sales outstanding of receivables was 47 days as of october 31 19 pretty much comparable to the same date in 18 and of course we closely monitor receivable collections to limit our credit exposure we have historically had very few losses on credit no one customer accounted for more than 10 of net sales and our 5 top 5 customers represented about 20 of consolidated net sales in both fiscal 19 and 18 inventory turnover rate of 124 days for the year ended october 19 was comparable to the same period in 18 total debt to shareholders equity decreased to 33 2 as of october 31 19 that was down from 35 4 as of october 31 18 net debt which is cash total debt less cash and cash equivalents of 505 million to shareholders equity decreased to 29 8 as of october 31 19 and that was down from 31 5 as of october 31 18 net debt to ebitda ratio improved to 0 93 times that s less than one time ebitda as of october 31 19 compared to 1 04 times as of october 31 18 and during fiscal 19 we successfully completed seven acquisitions i mean clearly just point out something which is obvious that our debt to ebitda ratio is extremely low we have tremendous liquidity capability we continue to look for acquisitions good acquisitions but we are very disciplined in what we look for but we certainly have the firepower and the financial strength to accomplish what our growth goals are we have no significant debt maturities until fiscal 23 and we will utilize our financial flexibility to aggressively pursue the high quality acquisitions in order to accelerate growth and maximize shareholder returns as we look ahead to fiscal 20 we anticipate net sales growth within flight support and etg resulting from increased demand across the majority of our product lines and our commitments to developing new products and services further market penetration pursuing an aggressive acquisition strategy with discipline while maintaining our great financial strength and flexibility based upon current economic visibility we believe fiscal 20 will be a record another record year we are estimating approximately 13 to 14 growth in full year net income 6 to 8 growth in full year net sales over fiscal 19 we anticipate fiscal year 20 consolidated operating margin to approximate 21 5 or 22 depreciation and amortization expense of about 89 million capex to approximate 42 million cash flow from operation to approximate 475 million and these estimates exclude additional acquired businesses if any i just want to mention at this time that historically many analysts have written and correctly so that coming out of the box and giving initial guidance for the past number of years heico has given that guidance on the conservative side i do believe without sticking my neck out too far i do believe that we will be conservative again that is our policy and we would rather under promise and over perform than promise something that we cannot deliver so i really hopefully as you know our target growth is bottom line growth net income of 15 to 20 over the prior year and i m very confident that we will be able to accomplish that in fiscal 20 in closing heico s team members have delivered these outstanding results and again deserve the credit for the hard work the discipline it took to successfully navigate another quarter our team members continue to win in the markets they serve and heico s management team has the utmost respect for everything they do to make this company a great success unfortunately we can t reflect the quality and the confidence of the people within heico the team members cannot be reflected in the financial statements however what they do is reflected in the performance and the driving and the growth of net income annually and this has happened over the past 30 years so i don t think it s a flash in the pan with that that is the extent of our prepared remarks and i would like to open the floor for questions thank you questions and answers operator we have our first question comes from the line of louis raffetto from ubs your line is open please ask your question louis raffetto ubs analyst good morning gentlemen laurans a mendelson chairman of the board and chief executive officer good morning louis raffetto ubs analyst so thanks for a little bit of the clarity on the really the disconnect between the sales growth and margin guidance and net income growth but can you give us a little bit more what s driving down the combined interest i m sorry tax rate and nci from sort of 25 to this 19 to 20 is there a special tax item or what s really driving down the nci next year i guess if it s not tax carlos l macau executive vice president and chief financial officer hi louis this is carlos can you hear me ok louis raffetto ubs analyst yeah carlos l macau executive vice president and chief financial officer so as you can recall from looking back at the year our both classes of shares had nice growth in stock appreciation and one thing that we did experience in our fiscal year was an acceleration in some option exercises what winds up happening is as those options get exercised the company gets a tax benefit for the appreciation if you would of the shares that the benefit of our team members in the form of compensation expense we recognize that every quarter because we had almost double the amount of option exercises in fiscal 19 which principally the majority of them were due to time outs we have 10 year options and in the 10th year if you don t exercise them you lose them and so we had quite a few options in that situation those got exercised this year about double the prior year so that is going to cause us to have the lower tax rate next year the true tax cash benefit to heico and we ll experience that in q1 of fiscal 20 louis raffetto ubs analyst okay so similar to last year just a larger magnitude carlos l macau executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and we also have pretty consistent nci rates with the prior year so roughly around 7 louis raffetto ubs analyst okay all right and then just one quick follow up i guess for eric i understand that you guys don t have a single platform risk i guess but how do you guys think about the guidance given the 737 max news after the close yesterday eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group louis i think heico is probably one of the companies in the industry with the least impact as a result of the 737 max we do have some new content that goes on it and that will be impacted but i believe that s going to be mitigated by the increase in our aftermarket part sales so i don t see this as a major item to heico heico has always got various speed bumps along the way we take care of it we don t call out special excuses for special events so i m very confident that there is not going to be much of an impact to heico laurans a mendelson chairman of the board and chief executive officer louis also we can factor it in and give you a hard number but traditionally as older airplanes fly that s our business supplying parts in older airplanes so you can put two and two together for yourself louis raffetto ubs analyst sure that should be again i don t want to call it a benefit but to eric s point it shouldn t be a least impact in the segment eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group yes louis raffetto ubs analyst thank you guys eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group thank you operator we have our next question from the line of robert spingarn from credit suisse your line is open please ask your questions robert spingarn credit suisse analyst hi good morning laurans a mendelson chairman of the board and chief executive officer good morning rob robert spingarn credit suisse analyst so i wanted to dig into the guidance a little bit for both segments you talked about your organic growth expectations a little bit different for the two so eric and victor if you could walk through how you think about growth and eric in particular based on that last question it does look like the max is going to redelivery of the max is going to slip here a bit we ve got replacement lift if you will or alternate lift in there with older aircraft consuming parts so how to what extent does that inform your expectations for 20 and then if you could also comment on the directionality of the margins in each segment eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group sure good morning rob this is eric i ll go ahead and go first with the flight support group we had organic growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 19 at 12 and that was against an extremely difficult comp in the fourth quarter of fiscal 18 our organic growth was 13 so that means between the two years we had organic growth of 25 which is really a number that is outstanding and frankly i ve never seen before at heico or at any other company to be able to post 25 organic growth over a two year period i think the fourth quarter surprised us with the strength that we had in fiscal 19 coming on top of fiscal 18 and frankly i would have expected some of that to fall into fiscal 20 so i think that s one of the things that s tempering down our expectations for fiscal 20 we just shipped so much in fiscal 19 because that s what our customers wanted that in effect made our 19 numbers higher and i believe some of those shipments probably normally would have occurred in fiscal 20 so i think that they re very strong i think our margins continue to increase last year i think it was 18 8 operating margin this year it was about 19 5 for flight support group approximately and so i anticipate the margins will continue to trend in that area robert spingarn credit suisse analyst okay eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group did that answer your question i don t know robert spingarn credit suisse analyst it did i think the other variable that we re all a bit focused on again is just with regard to max and i know we re all kind of guessing here on timing and you may not be able to really calibrate how much of your strength is coming from those temporarily extended airplanes but is there a range or is there a right way to think about your numbers if we have an early max return in calendar 20 versus a late return is there any kind of thought process around that we can anchor to eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group it s really hard to do even at our level our we do have some content which i mentioned on the max and of course that does get negatively impacted but it gets mitigated by the aftermarket so i think that the max delay is probably net net beneficial for heico or i m sure it s net beneficial for heico but it s very difficult for us to guess on really where that is because it really depends on how much money the airlines decide to put into the legacy fleet to keep it flying i suspect after the announcement yesterday that airlines will be more encouraged to spend money because they realize this is not going to be a fast return to service so when i talk with our folks internally frankly i expect that there should be very good aftermarket revenues as a result of this and of course you never know how long this could take to get corrected and now that the pause is in there it could end up taking longer i think than people originally thought in terms of resolving the regulatory and the technical and the manufacturing issues so i think net net for our aftermarket business it will be good but it s very hard to figure out the exact number the other thing which i also did want to point out you asked about margins is that while we had 12 organic growth in the fourth quarter in flight support we actually had operating income growth of 17 and that was basically all organic and i think that our team really did a phenomenal job because when you look at 17 organic growth in a single quarter on top of a difficult comp is really frankly even surprising me to the upside laurans a mendelson chairman of the board and chief executive officer rob this is larry i just want to add my own thoughts the budgets and the estimates in the guidance was done prior to boeing announcing the push out of the max production so to my knowledge i don t think our knowing our people who actually tend carlos always says to me those guys are sandbagging me so and knowing these people i suspect that they didn t put a lot of extra power into the benefits that we may receive i think they just looked at it business as usual without any effect additional impact from the max delay so i don t think the guidance contains much of a push as a result of what happened with the max robert spingarn credit suisse analyst right thanks for that yeah victor on your side victor h mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of electronic technologies group yeah rob so i would say that as i have in the past we go through this budget process and each subsidiary submits a bottoms up budget and they are generally conservative and then i go through with each company we review the budget and i get a sense for where i think they are perhaps being too conservative and some being too aggressive and then there is everybody in between and so this is really based on what i received from our guys and my sense of it is that they are being more conservative than usual i think they re concerned over where things could go in a number of areas like the defense budget and some other areas in space which is doing very well for us right now by the way at this point in time and has a very good outlook for us for next year so i just kind of have to accept what they give us and i don t really make too many adjustments unless they basically acknowledge to me that they know they are light robert spingarn credit suisse analyst victor just on that on the difference between space and defense and i guess you have some commercial as well but i think you said both in the press release and in your comments that defense drove the organic growth in the quarter in the latest quarter victor h mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of electronic technologies group correct robert spingarn credit suisse analyst and so does that mean that the other areas were flattish or maybe down a little and how do we think about those three pieces within your guide for this coming year victor h mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of electronic technologies group yeah that s a very good question the answer is no the others didn t do poorly they just didn t overall didn t do as well in the in the period and for the next year i would say it s we ve got a pretty good growth estimate across the board but we have pockets here and there companies that are giving us lower forecast than i think they re really believing internally themselves and some of that is on the defense side but we re thinking 2020 will be very good for us for example on the space side it should be very good for us commercial aviation is kind of a mixed bag for us for fiscal 2020 we ve got some good prospects there but i think our guys have been again on the conservative side and that s sort of proven out a little bit so far but i can t really make any trends out of the first month or six weeks of the fiscal year robert spingarn credit suisse analyst right and you re saying you think that from a margin perspective you ll be just i guess a hair around where you ve been a hair below victor h mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of electronic technologies group yeah exactly and look as you ve heard me say before when our guys come in and get businesses that are averaging before amortization of intangibles in the low 30s and they come in to you and they say well somebody says i m going to be 50 basis points lower i really can t get too upset with them because in absolute terms they re doing great it is typical for them again to come in and give me a conservative look at the margins but i believe and you ve heard me say this before and i think we believe and you ve heard us say this before that we prefer to have people rely on our official guidance and if we do better great but if not then we feel comfortable we re doing the right thing carlos has something to add carlos l macau executive vice president and chief financial officer rob i would just add to victor and eric s comments you ll see this in the k but our backlog is up that you ll see backlog is up like 15 over last year at this time which indicates to me that there s strength going into 2020 i think one of the challenges when we put our budgets together it was really across both segments was we had breakneck growth in our defense business and we anticipated that but the question is at what point does that moderate a bit and i think what victor and eric have done in the budgets and really what the subsidiaries and business unit leaders have done is they moderated their expectations that trees don t grow to the sky we can t continue to grow at what i ll call a breakneck pace in that segment of our business now i hope i m wrong and i think we all as a management team believe that we ll continue to do very well and that that that will continue but as larry mentioned and victor and eric both mentioned our guidance is relatively conservative coming out of the box and we hope to do better and over deliver robert spingarn credit suisse analyst thanks for the color guys appreciate that i ll step out laurans a mendelson chairman of the board and chief executive officer thanks rob operator we have our next question from the line of greg konrad from jefferies your line is open please ask your question greg konrad jefferies analyst good morning and great quarter laurans a mendelson chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you greg konrad jefferies analyst not to harp on the outlook and specifically etg but in the prepared comments i think victor you mentioned that etg could be higher based on us defense allocations are there particular areas of the budget that we should be focused on in terms of upside drivers victor h mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of electronic technologies group well i think it s i don t want to say which programs but i think it s more specific on programs that our guys are giving me a few in a few businesses an isolated number of incidents subsidiaries that they re giving me giving us a more conservative view than we think is likely but they are i mean it s specific programs and specific products greg konrad jefferies analyst that s helpful and then there were some press reports about expansion of pma parts in asia any color around potential penetration and maybe regional opportunities that you re seeing within the market victor h mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of electronic technologies group we continue to do very well in asia we ve been selling into asia now for over 25 years those customers are already great customers for us and i just anticipate continued enthusiasm and excitement for what we re doing i met with our sales leadership over the last couple of weeks and have gone on a review a customer by customer review and i can tell you we re doing extraordinarily well there has been a lot of acceptance and there is a lot of enthusiasm around our parts greg konrad jefferies analyst and then a just quick oh sorry victor h mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of electronic technologies group yeah no no that s right without naming specific customers in general there has been a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for our parts heico has got really an exceptional quality and technical reputation in the industry with 75 million parts shipped and no airworthiness directives or in flight shutdowns we really have a technical experience rating with these airlines unlike any other frankly any other supplier that works with them so they in particular the asian customers really appreciate that so i think we re going to continue to do very well greg konrad jefferies analyst and then just a follow up on pma obviously the faa has kind of looked at their process specific to aircraft certification is there any read through or carryover into the pma market and maybe opportunities or changes to the process victor h mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of electronic technologies group i don t believe so i think the faa is very satisfied with the process heico has a very good relationship with the faa they trust us and our i would have to say our relationship has never been better so we don t see any impact any negative impact greg konrad jefferies analyst thank you victor h mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of electronic technologies group thank you operator our next question comes from the line of peter arment from baird your line is open please ask your question peter arment robert w baird co analyst thanks good morning larry eric victor carlos a nice quarter and carlos maybe just a quick one on just capex pretty big step up kind of where you finished versus 19 the 42 million is that all timing related or is there anything specific you want to call out carlos l macau executive vice president and chief financial officer no there s some specific growth capital we ve for fiscal 2020 we have some expansion that we re planning on which is not speculative and we have some renovations we re doing to accommodate growth so that s in the budget it s not too dissimilar from the prior year i think last year we just had an extraordinarily low spend keep in mind we brought on seven new companies and they have needs too so i think overall even though it appears like a big step up from 19 if you look at 18 it s pretty similar to that spend and so i think that we re going to be around that ballpark number now having said all that right at the end of the day we always our guys always want to be very frugal and as larry has mentioned and the guys have mentioned before there s a lot buy used equipment instead of new equipment if they can get a cheaper they still retain sort of that entrepreneurial mindset on spend so i don t at this point i don t expect it exceeding that but i do based on our plans expect it to approximate that 42 million peter arment robert w baird co analyst okay and it s helpful and then just quickly on m a you continue to obviously source deals in quite successfully another strong year 240 i think 241 million you spent in fiscal 19 maybe larry just comment a little bit on the environment where multiples have been high for an extended period of time but you re still able to get deals done laurans a mendelson chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah i think that s exactly right multiples are high we still are the best buyer actually for the type of company that we want to acquire and that is an entrepreneurial company that has really his heart in the business and we are the best buyer from a cultural point of view there are a lot of opportunities we re looking at them and i would say the runway is filled we just have to find the right companies so last year we did six and the or seven and we the atmosphere wasn t very much different than it is today quite honestly we see some of the private equity people paying enormous prices they don t always make the right decision sometimes they do they do very well but i think we ll be able to do our normal if you will number of acquisitions and the kind of acquisitions we want so i think that yes price is a consideration but we ve found in the past too when prices drop and conditions are bid sellers also pull out of the market because they feel they missed the peak and they re going to wait till the price comes back so again i think it s kind of normal for us and we ll just continue doing what we did again if we did seven last year the market conditions aren t that much different today than they were over the last year peter arment robert w baird co analyst appreciate the color thanks operator we have our next question from the line of ken herbert your line is open please ask your question ken herbert canaccord genuity analyst hi good morning everybody laurans a mendelson chairman of the board and chief executive officer good morning ken ken herbert canaccord genuity analyst hi eric i first wanted to ask in either your distribution or your pma businesses has pricing i know the vast majority of your growth is volume but has pricing at all been any more of a tailwind either in the third or in the fourth quarter in particular considering pricing for the aftermarket industry in the aggregate has been a much stronger tailwind in 19 and 18 but i m curious if that s provided any cover for you to see any incremental benefit recently eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group good morning ken heico we often speak with investors who say why don t we push pricing and our philosophy really has been to maintain outstanding customer relationships and to leave a lot on the table to make sure that the customers want to come back for more because with the organic growth of 25 over two year period and operating income growth of roughly 17 all organic in the fourth quarter we believe that we are doing very well and if you will we want to share the benefits so to answer your question no we have not been pushing pricing we know that this is an opportunity for us it is something that we have not done and frankly in order to just continue to develop the relationships that we have with our customers you ve been to a number of our customer events and i think that the energy that our customers feel toward heico and the spirit among our people is sort of unique in the industry and i think moderating pricing is one of the ways that we are able to do that so frankly private equity folks whether on the repair side or the pma side they ve got to push pricing because they ve got big debt payments we don t have that so we re able to really take the long view and i think that s how we ve been able to accomplish this over 30 years ken herbert canaccord genuity analyst okay that s very helpful and if i could just on the fourth quarter growth maybe in a slightly different way i wanted to follow up on the question asked earlier around international opportunities can you provide anymore maybe detail on the growth you re seeing with airlines or customers in emerging markets that are coming off a relatively lower base for you relative to maybe the more established western europe and north american legacy airlines is there any color you can provide on how the growth might break out and to what extent you re seeing penetration into what historically have been more challenging customers out in the emerging markets eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group yeah we are doing very well with new customers the opportunity for us is to bring on new customers as well as to take existing customers and broaden the product line so overall we re doing i think very well in both of those areas but frankly that story is consistent with the last 20 years and i wouldn t say that it s really any different than it is now but we it continues to i would say grow at a similar rate to how it has in the past ken herbert canaccord genuity analyst okay that s great and just finally if i could victor were there any impact or any delayed shipments in october for you as a result of the lack of a fiscal 20 defense budget was timing at all a factor of some of what maybe i think you alluded to this earlier maybe what held back some of the organic growth for you in the fourth quarter that could have maybe slipped into 20 or was that not a factor victor h mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of electronic technologies group it s a good question for the defense budget no i don t think the continuing resolution issues and so on i don t think that really impacted us we do have every quarter shipments that slipped from one to the other for any number of ordinary reasons like the truck doesn t show up or the customer doesn t perform their final test and evaluation things of that nature and we had what i would call the typical noise level of that in the fourth quarter so nothing notable at this point ken herbert canaccord genuity analyst all right well thank you very much laurans a mendelson chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you operator we have our next question from the line of michael ciarmoli your line is open from suntrust and your line is open please ask your question michael ciarmoli suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hey good morning guys nice quarter thanks for taking the questions laurans a mendelson chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you michael ciarmoli suntrust robinson humphrey analyst maybe i don t know if this is eric or victor but maybe just to go back to pma penetration and adoption certainly within the commercial space it seems like you re very well penetrated can you maybe talk about what you re seeing within the dod marketplace especially as they look to cut cost maybe wean themselves off of some of the sole source suppliers out there are you as you re looking at that market is there a lot of runway for growth or maybe you could just give some color on penetration rates and what you re expecting at the dod level there eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group hi good morning mike that s a great question we think that there is a good opportunity we re harvesting net opportunity it is a very difficult market to access because the dod may complain about high prices in particular areas but they have to really dedicate the resources to go after it we are succeeding in that area and i think due to heico s reputation that we re able to do well if that gives you the color you re looking for michael ciarmoli suntrust robinson humphrey analyst it did and can i assume it s fixed wing rotorcraft kind of the normal product lines that you might penetrate in the commercial world eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group yes yeah i think that it s probably more fixed wing michael ciarmoli suntrust robinson humphrey analyst got it and then just maybe back to the 737 max situation and thinking about the return to service obviously a lot of the carriers who are looking for extra capacity have used older planes do you get a sense that there could be some headwinds when we finally get that return to service pick a date maybe it is mid year for a global return to service if we do see a wave of legacy retirements and we see a lot of surplus parts used and serviceable material in the marketplace do you think that actually flips around and creates some headwinds for you guys that we should be aware of eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group i don t think so my guess is and look i frankly don t know much more than what everybody reads in the wall street journal and reads in the various analyst reports and the publications this is a very complex situation and i feel very badly for boeing for what they re going through with this but it s very difficult to i mean this is monumental task that these folks have ahead of themselves so you ve got to assume that it s going to take a good chunk of time until they return to service guess who knows six months or something and once that happens they then have to get the 400 plus aircraft that are built into the system so i think that s going to take a period of time i do think that airlines who have been deferring maintenance anticipating a return to service are going to have to finally if you will bite the bullet and do some of this maintenance but all of this news is relatively news so it s hard to estimate on what the impact to heico is going to be but no i don t anticipate some massive retirements based upon the return to service of these aircraft i think it s going to take really a while to get them delivered michael ciarmoli suntrust robinson humphrey analyst got it eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group so yeah michael ciarmoli suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay last one from me can you give a little bit more color eric on the product development are you seeing more opportunities on specific parts of the plane whether it s engine airframe whether it s some of the newer planes coming off warranty and you re seeing new greenfield opportunities just anything you could provide around how you re spending and where those new products are being targeted for eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group sure i would say it s really consistent with every plays in the past we re doing very well on the engine side the component side across the fleet narrow body wide body i think it s a broad based support for our business as i mentioned when ken had asked this question i think by being very customer friendly with regard to pricing that also helps us and has helped to develop a culture that heico has and the customer appreciation that we ve got so it s really very broad based across our entire product family michael ciarmoli suntrust robinson humphrey analyst got it helpful thanks a lot guys i ll jump back in the queue eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group thank you operator we have our next question from the line of george godfrey from clk your line is open please ask your question george godfrey c l king associates analyst thank you good morning gentlemen nice quarter as always laurans a mendelson chairman of the board and chief executive officer thanks george good morning george godfrey c l king associates analyst welcome just wanted to come i know we re beating a dead horse here on the 737 but can you provide any average content over any time period that you ve looked at within the fleet and i realize many planes many customers but is there any way to gauge over a three to five year period on a per platform how much an average customer might take in content from heico for that plane and that s really all i had thanks eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group yeah it s a good question but due to the decentralized nature of our business it would be very difficult for us to determine exactly what that number is it depends on based on the burn rate of the parts and which customers approve which parts i think we have it layered into our expectations but it by itself it really would be difficult to do george godfrey c l king associates analyst understood just thought i ll try thanks eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group thank you thank you very much operator we have our next question from the line of gautam khanna from cowen your line is open please ask your question gautam khanna cowen co analyst thanks good morning guys laurans a mendelson chairman of the board and chief executive officer good morning gautam khanna cowen co analyst i just had a couple of questions one i was wondering if you can tell us where you are on the cfm parts development and qualification any news there when do you anticipate launching more products given the developments earlier in the year eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group so we re i would say we re doing very well over in that area we continue to develop products i think there s a lot of customer interest i m reluctant due to competitive reasons to specifically call it out but i think that the iata a resolution has been uniquely good for heico and frankly i think cfm is going to continue to do extremely well they ve got a lot of parts in that engine we re going to take our little piece but i think it will continue to be important to heico as well as cfm gautam khanna cowen co analyst okay and can you also maybe in the q it usually comes out but the growth in aftermarket parts versus r o in the quarter what have you seen r o carlos l macau executive vice president and chief financial officer in the quarter we saw actually in q4 we saw a very strong organic growth in our component repair business and it was out of all the three groups it was probably the quickest organic grower however both other groups grew very strong also and that was i think the first time in fiscal 19 that we would actually see the repair business outpace the parts and the specialty product group so that tells me that there s some that system repairs that s starting to pick up and as eric mentioned earlier maybe some of the maintenance people will because they were we re benefiting from it gautam khanna cowen co analyst okay thank you and just one last one should we assume a normal year for product new pma part introduction 500 600 parts or how does 20 shape up eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group i would say consistent with past years consistent with past years gautam khanna cowen co analyst thank you very much guys eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group but yes we re doing very well in that area as well thank you very much operator we have our next question from the line of colin ducharme from sterling capital your line is open please ask your question colin ducharme sterling capital analyst hi good morning folks thanks for the question most of my questions have been answered but i just wanted to drill down a little bit with eric on your i guess it was in the release your comment on the year on year comparison benefit from contingent consideration could you just shed a little bit more color is that just a compare or is that actually a decline based on some recent deal performance and then also for carlos you talked a little bit about the capex expectations for the year forward if you could provide a little bit more color on which sides of the business and perhaps which end market verticals are kind of driving that growth that would be great then i had a follow up thanks carlos l macau executive vice president and chief financial officer let me take the this is carlos let me take the contingent earn out question the favorability of that is really a change on the change we had in q4 2018 a charge that we took to increase contingent earn out based on anticipated better performance which actually panned out to 19 so we were right to do that we did not have similar charges in q4 18 so that actually was a help that helped us do you understand that colin ducharme sterling capital analyst yeah i got it i appreciate that color and then just following up on that capex which kind of sides of the business or end market verticals there driving that increased forecast carlos l macau executive vice president and chief financial officer so across both segments we have capex spend growth however we have within the within etg we do have some expansion that we re doing that we plan to do which has heated it up a little bit on their side and then we actually have some we re actually doing some corporate renovations which are not a ton but that s something that s really nice it s shared by all segments and the corporate office so we have expansion that we re doing there some of that goes toward flight support and some of that goes toward corporate but other than some expansion for those reasons it s the normal capex trends that we normally see here at heico nothing unusual colin ducharme sterling capital analyst okay thanks and then just a quick follow up for eric just speculating perhaps probing a little bit here as we get extensions with the max kind of deliveries is there a sales opportunity perhaps with content per platform i m thinking specifically of airlines that in your words eventually have to bite the bullet they forestalled certain maintenance they haven t used used heico on certain parts of the aircraft perhaps not on others is this an opportunity for you kind of uniquely to grow your wallet share and expand relationships to seize the moment thanks eric a mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of flight support group i think yes it is an opportunity for us to pick up additional sales the primary route for that will be parts that customers had already been buying from us in the past and maybe they slowed down buying because they thought they were going to retire the aircraft and that will permit them to go ahead and make the expenditures as far as customers who haven t purchased the parts yes i think that it s all part of our continuing value proposition they see the benefit that they ve got from as a result of buying our parts the cost impact that they ve got on the max being out of service and clearly they can save money as a result of buying additional part so yes i think you ve hit the nail on the head colin ducharme sterling capital analyst okay thanks and then one final one for victor i love looking at the companies you rolled up over time quell looks very interesting indeed to my untrained eye rubber seals it looks replicable from the outside looking in can you just perhaps use the lens of your m a framework and talk a little bit about whether it d be patent protection or perhaps increased growth opportunities once you bring this product set on board what do you see with this asset over time thanks victor h mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of electronic technologies group well yeah thank you that s a good question it s a great company it is would be very difficult if not impossible to replicate those parts they re not rubber seals they are emi filters they re electrical filters with electronic components embedded in them and they operate in a certain way and they re built in a certain way that would be very very difficult to replicate aside from the fact that some of their products have patent protection i don t rely on the patent protection in fact usually for any of our products you ve got to really rely on competitive protection that s at least in our opinion so it s a growing business it s a rapidly growing business successful business it has been around for a while but their growth has really stepped up in the last few years because some of the because of some of the changes they ve made marketing changes in particular and getting much more aggressive about going out and visiting the customer base i personally interviewed their top customers in the due diligence in the last week or so major companies engineers purchasing people and like and they were raving about quell now having said that it s our typical kind of acquisition so it is not going to change heico s profile don t expect that as you know we don t swing for the fences there are singles and doubles so it s not the sort of thing that you re going to pick up our next earnings report and fine that we ve doubled because we are getting a giant increase because of this business it will add to heico as our typical acquisitions do colin ducharme sterling capital analyst thank you very much victor h mendelson co president of heico corp president and chief executive officer of electronic technologies group you re welcome operator there are no questions at this time please continue laurans a mendelson chairman of the board and chief executive officer

pucture depositphotos com fandorina first and foremost the new view of debt understates the risks to other claimants on public tax revenues such as pensioners who might be thought of as junior debt holders in the twenty first century welfare state after all most social security systems are debt like in the sense that the government takes money from you now and promises to pay it back with interest when you are old and for governments this junior debt is massive relative to the senior market debt that sits atop it indeed governments in oecd countries are currently paying out an average of 8 of gdp in old age pensions and a staggering 16 in the case of italy and greece actuarially future taxes earmarked for paying pensions swamp future taxes earmarked for paying debt by a significant multiple although many governments have been trying to adjust pensions downward gradually as europe did during the financial crisis and mexico and brazil have done under duress more recently unfortunately slow growth and aging populations mean much remains to be done thus even if it seems that governments can take on much more debt without having to pay significantly higher market interest the real risks and costs may be hidden economists alan auerbach and laurence kotlikoff made a similar point in an influential series of papers back in the 1990s second and perhaps even more critically the current complacency regarding much higher debt implicitly assumes that the next crisis will look just like the last one in 2008 when interest rates on government debt collapsed but history suggests that this is a dangerous assumption for example the next wave of crises could easily stem from a sudden realization that climate change is accelerating much faster than previously thought requiring governments simultaneously to stall the capitalist engine and spend vast sums on preventive measures and remediation not to mention dealing with climate refugees and the next global conflagration could be a cyber war with unknown ramifications for growth and interest rates moreover aggressive experimentation with much higher debt might cause a corresponding shift in market sentiment an example of the nobel laureate economist robert lucas s critique that big shifts in policy can backfire owing to big shifts in expectations and frankly any realistic assessment of current global economic risks must acknowledge that the world s most important economy is in state of political paralysis with impulsive decision making leaving it ill equipped to deal with an outside the box crisis should one arise the bottom line is that there is no guarantee that interest rates will fall in the next global crisis none of the preceding arguments undermine the strong case for investing now in high return infrastructure projects including in education that more than pay for themselves in the long run as long as governments adhere to sound debt management criteria balancing risk and cost when choosing maturities today s ultra low interest rates offer great opportunities but the broader claim that issuing government debt has become a veritable free lunch similar to government profits from currency issuance has been dangerously overblown if the aim of government policy is to reduce inequality the only sustainable long term solution involves raising taxes on high earners debt is not a magic shortcut for giving to the poor without taking from the rich true in many advanced economies current real inflation adjusted interest rates on government debt are below the real rate of economic growth presumably therefore governments can take on much more debt without ever having to raise taxes after all as long as income is growing faster than the stock of public debt simple arithmetic shows that the ratio of debt to gdp income will fall over time yet things are not quite so simple interest rates are ultra low in part because global investors are starved of safe assets that will still pay out in the event of a sharp downturn or economic catastrophe but can governments in fact provide that insurance for free if there is a risk that interest rates will rise in the next major systemic crisis a recent international monetary fund study of 55 countries over the last 200 years showed that although economic growth exceeded interest rates on government debt almost half the time this was not a good predictor of whether the surveyed countries were safe from interest rate spikes in a crisis last but not least how sure can investors be that they will come first in line in the next crisis as they did in 2008 will the united states government again put wall street before main street and honor debts to china ahead of obligations to pensioners modern economies have many important uses for debt but it is never a risk free option for governments which is why it should be taken on and managed wisely even when rock bottom borrowing costs prevail project syndicate 1995 2019
18 12 2019 report signs of infrastructure spending boost in china geopoliticalmonitor com a new round of infrastructure stimulus would contradict the chinese government s official line which stresses the need for quality growth even if it comes at a slower pace than recent years rather than any new major stimulus program the financial times is reporting a rise of approx 15 in the price of construction materials in major chinese cities reversing a recent trend of month on month declines the data suggests an uptick in new infrastructure projects a favored tool of policymakers to stimulate economic activity during periods of contraction but new fiscal stimulus is not without its own risks particularly in the case of china where the government is already struggling to deleverage the formal and informal lending sectors a new state led infrastructure bonanza could lead to more white elephant projects which though useful in stimulating economic activity over the short term seldom provide enough of a long term growth dividend to justify the initial investment think the ghost cities and empty airports that used to feature prominently in western media reports on china nowadays not so much amid the ongoing us china trade war and societal tightening of the xi jinping era such matters have increasingly been regarded as a closely guarded state secret a new round of infrastructure stimulus would contradict the chinese government s official line which stresses the need for quality growth even if it comes at a slower pace than recent years rather than any new major stimulus program according to official figures infrastructure spending grew just 3 3 over the first 10 months of 2019 the stimulus issue boils down to two overriding considerations growth and debt china s official gdp rate came in at 6 6 in 2018 just above the government target of around 6 5 this target was reduced to 6 6 5 for 2019 and there are indications that the final number may fall short of the mark front and center is the country s third quarter growth rate of just 6 its lowest rate of expansion in over 25 years analysts are expecting that number to fall even further in the fourth quarter barring a sudden resolution of the trade war there s always room for a healthy degree of skepticism so far as china s official growth numbers are concerned national figures are fed into by the country s 32 regional governments which are composed of officials who are essentially incentivized to paint as sunny an economic picture as possible even if the ground level realities don t match up michael pettis an american economist at peking university maintains that the real number could be as low as half the official rate xiang songzuo of renmin university of china has an even gloomier outlook he believes that the real gdp rate for 2018 could be in the 1 range or even in negative territory this year s moribund third quarter gdp numbers prompted an immediate policy response from beijing which eased restrictions on local governments and allowed early access to their 2020 lending quotas upward price movement in the construction industry would seem to suggest that a significant share of this money is finding its way into new state directed projects debt is the second overriding concern of prc policymakers and again this is a topic where the official numbers may not reflect ground level realities china s recent growth has been enabled in large part by two drivers the informal lending sector shadow banking and atypical local government financing vehicles lgfvs which were booming before a government crackdown came down in 2017 these lgfvs were a favored tool of local governments for boosting their economic metrics often with little regard for long term sustainability both of these vehicles represent debt piles that won t show up on national government balance sheets even though it s ultimately up to beijing to provide the bailouts in the event of a crash just how much money are we talking last year standard poor s put off balance sheet borrowing by local governments in china at around 6 trillion nearly four times the size of the russian economy the on sheet picture is also daunting particularly in the corporate and household sectors in november china s central bank warned about the risks associated with low income households as total debt is now equal to total household income by way of comparison canadian households currently owe around 1 77 for every dollar of income the speculative nature of these household debts many of which were taken on in mortgages in full expectation of perpetual growth in prices makes them particularly susceptible to fluctuations in the real estate market in other words a sharp and sudden downturn could trigger a cascade of defaults that constitute a systemic risk this hint of systemic risk is partially why the government has also been actively bailing out distressed private sector enterprises since last year

incorporated and domiciled in singapore related companies in these financial statements refer to the members of the macan pte ltd group summary of significant accounting policies basis of preparation the interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 september 2019 have been prepared in accordance with ias 34 interim financial reporting the interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the group s annual consolidated financial statements as at 31 march 2019 the financial statements have been drawn up in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs as adopted by the european union and are prepared under the historical cost convention except as disclosed in the accounting policies below the consolidated financial statements of the group are presented in united states dollar us which is the functional currency and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements in compliance with ifrs requires management to make judgements estimates and assumptions that affect the group s application of accounting policies and reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions actual results may differ from those estimates the areas where such judgements or estimates have significant effect on the financial statements are disclosed in note 3 to the financial statements the group has adopted all the new and revised ifrs that are relevant to its operations and effective for the current financial period the adoption of these new revised ifrs did not result in changes to the group s accounting policies and had no material effect on the amounts reported for the current or prior financial periods except as detailed below adoption of new and amended standards and interpretations the group applied ifrs 16 retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying this standard as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings as at 1 april 2019 the date of initial application the group elected to apply the practical expedient to not reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease at the date of initial application contracts entered into before the transition date that were not identified as leases under ifrs 1 17 and ifrs 4 were not reassessed the definition of lease under ifrs 16 was applied only to contracts entered into or changed on or after 1 april 2019 in applying the modified retrospective approach the group has taken advantage of the following practical expedients a single discount rate has been applied to portfolios of leases with reasonably similar characteristics leases with a remaining term of twelve months from the date of initial application have been accounted for as short term leases i e not recognised on statement of financial position even though the initial term of the leases from lease commencement date may have been more than twelve months initial direct costs have not been included in the measurement of the right of use asset at the date of initial application for the purpose of measuring the right of use asset hindsight has been used therefore it has been measured based on prevailing estimates at the date of initial application and not retrospectively by making estimates and judgements such as lease terms based on circumstances on or after the lease commencement date as a lessee the group previously classified leases as finance or operating lease based on its assessment of whether the lease transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership under ifrs 16 the group recognises right of use assets and lease liabilities for most leases for those low value assets based on the value of the underlying asset when new and leases with a lease term of 12 months or less the group has elected not to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities for these leases on adoption of ifrs 16 the group recognised right of use assets and lease liabilities in relation to international school which had previously been classified as operating leases lease liabilities from operating leases under the principles of ifrs 1 17 were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using lessee s incremental borrowing rate as at 1 april 2019 the right of use assets were measured as follows all leases the carrying amount is determined as if ifrs 16 being applied from the commencement date of the leases subject to the practical expedients listed above standards issued but not yet effective the company has not adopted the following relevant standards and interpretations that have been issued but not yet effective effective for annual periods description beginning on or after int frs 3 amendments to int frs 3 definition of a business 1 january 2020 int frs 1 8 amendments to int frs 1 8 definition of material 1 january 2020 the directors expect that the adoption of the other standards and interpretations above will have no material impact on the financial statements in the period of initial application basis of consolidation and business combinations basis of consolidation the consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and its subsidiaries subsidiaries are entities over which the group has control the group controls an investee if the group has power over the investee exposure to variable returns from the investee and the ability to use its power to affect those variable returns control is reassessed whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there may be a change in any of these elements of control subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the group up to the effective date on which control is lost as appropriate intra group balances and transactions and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra group transactions are eliminated on consolidation unrealised losses may be an impairment indicator of the asset concerned the financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as that of the company using consistent accounting policies where necessary accounting policies of subsidiaries are changed to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by other members of the group non controlling interests in subsidiaries relate to the equity in subsidiaries which is not attributable directly or indirectly to the owners of the parent they are shown separately in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income financial position and changes in equity non controlling interests in the acquiree that are a present ownership interest and entitle its holders to a proportionate share of the entity s net assets in the event of liquidation may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non controlling interests proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree s identifiable net assets the choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition by acquisition basis subsequent to acquisition the carrying amount of non controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non controlling interests share of subsequent changes in equity total comprehensive income is attributed to non controlling interests even if this results in the non controlling interests having a deficit balance changes in the group s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions the carrying amounts of the group s interests and the non controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary any difference between the amount by which the non controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the company basis of consolidation and business combinations when the group loses control of a subsidiary it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non controlling interest the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between i the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and ii the previous carrying amount of the assets including goodwill and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non controlling interests amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for i e reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of the fair value of any investments retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under ias 39 financial instruments recognition and measurement or when applicable the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or joint venture in the separate financial statements of the company investment in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment loss that has been recognised in profit or loss business combinations and goodwill business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date acquisition related costs are recognised as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in profit or loss each individual business combination that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of net assets are recognised by the group on the acquisition date either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree s identifiable net assets other components of non controlling interests are measured at their acquisition date fair value unless another measurement basis is required by another frs any excess of the sum of the fair value of the consideration transferred in the business combination the amount of non controlling interest in the acquiree if any and the fair value of the group s previously held equity interest in the acquiree if any over the net fair value of the acquiree s identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill in instances where the latter amount exceeds the former the excess is recognised as gain on bargain purchase in profit or loss on the acquisition date goodwill is initially measured at cost following initial recognition goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses for the purpose of impairment testing goodwill acquired in a business combination is from the acquisition date allocated to the group s cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units the cash generating units to which goodwill have been allocated is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the cash generating unit may be impaired impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash generating unit or group of cash generating units to which the goodwill relates revenue recognition revenue is recognised when a performance obligation is satisfied revenue is measured based on consideration of which the group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised good or services to a customer excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties i e sales related tax the consideration

vesting conditions at the date of grant the fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled share based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding credit to the share based payment reserve based on the group s estimate of the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market based vesting conditions at the end of each financial year the group revises the estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest the impact of the revision of the original estimates if any is recognised in profit or loss over the remaining vesting period with a corresponding adjustment to the share based payment reserve taxes income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax current income tax the tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the financial year taxable profit differs from profit reported as profit or loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are not taxable or tax deductible the group s liability for current tax is recognised at the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the taxation authorities and is calculated using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted in countries where the company and its subsidiaries operate by the end of the financial year current income taxes are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items recognised outside profit or loss either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity deferred tax deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit deferred tax liabilities are recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each financial year and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted in countries where the group operates by the end of the financial year the measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the group expects to recover or settle its assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis

translation of the net investment in foreign entities including monetary items that in substance form part of the net investment in foreign entities and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments are taken to the foreign exchange reserve on disposal of a foreign operation the accumulated foreign exchange reserve relating to that operation is reclassified to profit or loss plant and equipment all items of plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost the cost includes its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management dismantlement removal or restoration costs are included as part of the cost if the obligation for dismantlement removal or restoration is incurred as a consequence of acquiring or using the plant and equipment subsequent expenditure on an item of plant and equipment is added to the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost can be measured reliably all other costs of servicing are recognised in profit or loss when incurred plant and equipment are subsequently stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method on the following bases computers 3 years furniture and fittings 3 years motor vehicles 5 years the carrying values of plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable the estimated useful lives residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed and adjusted as appropriate at the end of each financial year an item of plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal the gain or loss arising on disposal or retirement of an item of plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss intangible assets area development and centre fees an area development fee is paid for the exclusive rights to develop and operate the wall street english language centre in myanmar while the centre fee is required to be paid in respect for the opening of a new wall street english language centre in myanmar the area development and centre fees are capitalized and amortised over the period of 10 years from the date operation commences and when the new centre commences operations respectively the area development and centre fees are initially capitalized at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated losses set up fee and brand licensing fee set up fee is paid for the exclusive rights to develop and operate the auston college in myanmar brand licensing fee is paid for the exclusive irrecoverable non transferrable rights of use of the licenses intellectual property and trademark for the operations of the auston college the set up and brand licensing fees are capitalized and amortised over the period of 10 years from the date operation commences the set

software license is initially capitalized at cost which includes the purchase price net of any discounts and rebates and other directly attributable costs of preparing the software for its intended use direct expenditure which enhances or extends the performance of computer software beyond its specifications and which can be reliably measured is added to the original cost of the software costs associated with maintaining computer software are recognized as an expense is incurred computer software license is subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses these costs are amortised to profit or loss under the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of 3 years customer related assets services segment customer related assets comprise customer contracts and customer relationship arising from business combinations and initially measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition these assets are capitalized at fair value as at acquisition date and subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated losses amortisation is recognized in profit or loss on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of 3 years goodwill services segment goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary or business represents the excess of the consideration transferred the amount of any non controlling interests in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary recognized at the date of acquisition goodwill on subsidiary is recognized separately as intangible assets goodwill is initially recognized at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses for the purpose of impairment testing goodwill is allocated to each of the group s cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired if the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit an impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in the subsequent period on disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised over the estimated useful and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired the amortisation period and the amortisation method are reviewed at least at each financial year end changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method as appropriate and are treated as changes in accounting estimates the amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite useful lives is recognized in profit or loss or expected category consistent with the function of the intangible asset an item of intangible asset is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use of disposal any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset is included in profit or loss in the financial year the asset is derecognised area development fees and centre fees wall street english an area development fee is paid for the exclusive rights to develop and operate the wall street english language centre in myanmar the area development fee is capitalised and amortised over the period of 10 years from the date operation commences centre fees are required to be paid in respect of the opening of a new wall street english language centre in myanmar the centre fees paid are capitalised and amortised over the period of 10 years from the date when the respective centre commences operations the area development fees and centre fees are initially capitalised at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated losses brand licensing fees and set up fees auston college myanmar brand license fee and set up fee are paid for the rights to develop and operate the auston college in myanmar the license fee is capitalised and amortised over the period of 10 years from the date of operation commences the brand license fee and set up fee are initially capitalised at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated losses impairment of non financial assets at the end of each financial year the group reviews the carrying amounts of its non financial assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss if any such indication exists the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset if the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount the carrying amount of the asset cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss where an impairment loss subsequently reverses the carrying amount of the asset cash generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash generating unit in prior years a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss financial instruments financial assets the group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories below depending on the group s business model for managing the financial assets as well as the contractual terms of the cash flows of the financial asset the group shall reclassify its affected financial assets when and only when the group changes its business model for managing these financial assets the group s accounting policy for each category is as follows amortised cost these assets arise principally from provision of services to customers but also incorporate other types of financial assets where the objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest they are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directlyattributable to their acquisition or issue and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less provision for impairment impairment provisions for trade receivables are recognised based on the simplified approach within ifrs 9 using the lifetime expected credit losses during this process the probability of the non payment of the trade receivables is assessed this probability is then multiplied by the amount of the expected loss arising from default to determine the lifetime expected credit loss for the trade receivables for trade receivables which are reported net such provisions are recorded in a separate provision account with the loss being presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on confirmation that the trade receivable will not be collectable the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision impairment provisions for other financial assets are recognised based on a forward looking expected credit loss model the methodology used to determine the amount of the provision is based on whether at each reporting date there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial asset for those where the credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition of the financial asset twelve month expected credit losses along with gross interest income are recognised for those for which credit risk has increased significantly lifetime expected credit losses along with the gross interest income are recognised for those that are determined to be credit impaired lifetime expected credit losses along with interest income on a net basis are recognised the group s financial assets measured at amortised cost comprise trade and other receivables excluding prepayment and advances for hostel operations and cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of financial position financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income fvoci the group has a strategic investment in the equity securities of an unlisted entity which is not accounted for as a subsidiary associate or jointly controlled entity the group has made an irrevocable election to classify the investment at fair value through other comprehensive income rather than through profit or loss as the group considers this measurement to be the most representative of the business model for these assets they are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the fair value through other comprehensive income reserve upon disposal any balance within fair value through other comprehensive income reserve is reclassified directly to retained earnings and is not reclassified to profit or loss dividends are recognised in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment in which case the full or partial amount of the dividend is recorded against the associated investment carrying amount purchases and sales of financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are recognised on settlement date with any change in fair value between trade date and settlement date being recognised in the fair value through other comprehensive income reserve derecoqnition of financial assets the group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity classification as debt or equity financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument equity instruments an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group after deducting all of its liabilities equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs the company classifies ordinary shares as equity instruments financial liabilities and equity instruments financial liabilities the group classifies all financial liabilities as subsequently measured at amortised cost trade and other payables trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost where applicable using the effective interest method loan from ultimate holding company interest bearing loan from ultimate holding company is measured at fair value net of transaction costs and is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the settlement or redemption of the loan is recognised over the term of the borrowings in accordance with the group s accounting policy for borrowing costs loan due from ultimate holding company is presented as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period in which case it is presented as non current liabilities derecognition of financial liabilities the group derecognises financial liabilities when and only when the group s obligations are discharged cancelled or they expire the difference between the carrying amount and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents comprise of cash at bank which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value cash and cash equivalents carried in the statement of financial position is classified and accounted for as financial asset at amortised cost under ifrs 9 provisions provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event it is probable that the group will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation the amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the financial year taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows when some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as finance expense loss per share basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss for the financial period year attributable to owners of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial period year unaudited unaudited audited 6 months ended 6 months ended year ended 30 september 2019 30 september 2018 31 march 2019 loss for the financial period year attributable to owners

i am honored to be here today to celebrate benoît coeuré s tenure at the european central bank ecb i have been working with benoît now for a decade starting at our respective treasuries where we both were drafted as financial firefighters migrating to our respective central banks to help with stabilization recovery and normalization and most recently preparing for the challenges that lie ahead over the course of that decade i have developed deep admiration for benoît s keen insights and outstanding judgment 1 equally important benoît always has a plan generally it is the right plan addressed to the right problem and he executes it with exceptional efficacy and strong support that is a rare and invaluable combination in public service indeed benoît s tenure at the ecb coincided with an incredible turnaround in unemployment and output growth both the euro area and the global economy have benefited greatly from benoît coeuré s outstanding public service moreover benoît s research interests are forward looking and extend well beyond the macro economy when benoît was appointed chair of the committee on payments and market infrastructures cpmi the global standard setter for payment issues he doubled its output resulting in 75 reports 2 he turned its focus to distributed ledger stablecoins and central bank digital currencies long before many other central bankers realized these issues would be transforming their worlds indeed the number of google searches for central bank digital currencies increased sharply over the course of benoît s tenure as chair of the cpmi digital currencies money and payments i was asked to provide some brief thoughts about digital developments in the world of monetary policy and central banking at the start of benoît s ecb term bitcoin s market capitalization was small and only a handful of cryptocurrencies existed in the eight years since then bitcoin s market capitalization has grown rapidly and now exceeds 100 billion euros and thousands of cryptocurrencies have been created 3 the potential of global stablecoins to scale rapidly is evident from the increasingly fast rates of technology adoption and the growth of large networks adoption rates for new technologies have accelerated over time in 1921 35 percent of u s households had telephone service and it took 40 more years for telephone lines to reach 80 percent of homes in contrast the internet achieved the same level of adoption in only 13 years more recently smartphones and social media have achieved the same level of u s household adoption in less than a decade 4 rapid adoption is also evident in the payments landscape where network externalities figure prominently between the first quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2019 transactions through venmo grew over 66 times to 21 billion 23 9 billion euros 5 systems in other countries have also scaled rapidly in china mobile payments grew over 35 times during the same period to 8 2 trillion 9 3 trillion euros 6 india s unified payments interface upi has grown even faster between the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2019 the transaction value grew nearly 400 times to 500 million 600 million euros 7 digital currency payments projects from big technology firms that have network advantages have the potential to scale even more rapidly because the utility of any medium of exchange increases with the size of the network using it the power of a stablecoin payment system depends on the breadth of its adoption with nearly one third of the global population as active users on facebook the libra stablecoin project stands out for the speed with which its network could reach global scale in payments stablecoin networks at global scale are leading us to revisit questions over what form money can take who or what can issue it and how payments can be recorded and settled while central bank money and commercial bank money are the foundations of the modern financial system nonbank private money or assets also facilitate transactions among a network of users in some cases such nonbank private assets may have value only within the network while in other cases the issuer may promise convertibility to a sovereign currency such that this becomes a liability of the issuing entity stablecoins aspire to achieve the functions of traditional money without relying on confidence in an issuer such as a central bank to stand behind the money for some potential stablecoins a close assessment suggests users may have no rights with respect to the underlying assets or any issuer we have already seen the growth of massive payments networks on existing digital platforms such as alibaba and wechat so far these networks operate within a jurisdiction based on the sovereign currency as the unit of account and balances are transferable in and out of bank or credit card accounts we have also seen the issuance of stablecoins on a smaller scale such as gemini or paxos what would set facebook s libra apart if it were to proceed is the combination of an active user network representing more than a third of the global population with the issuance of a private digital currency opaquely tied to a basket of sovereign currencies 8 libra like any stablecoin project with global scale and scope must address a core set of legal and regulatory challenges a significant concern regarding facebook s libra project is the potential for a payment system to be adopted globally in a short time period and to establish itself as a potentially new unit of account unlike social media platforms or ridesharing applications payment systems cannot be designed as they develop due to the nexus with consumers financial security this is why in many jurisdictions including the european union there is a regime to oversee retail payment systems without requisite safeguards stablecoin networks at global scale may put consumers at risk cryptocurrencies already pose a number of risks to the financial system and these could be magnified by a widely accepted stablecoin for general use estimated losses from fraud and thefts associated with cryptocurrencies are rising at a staggering pace from 1 7 billion 1 4 billion euros in 2018 to over 4 4 billion 3 9 billion euros in 2019 based on one industry estimate 9 the hacking of exchanges represents a significant source of the theft followed by the targeting of individual users through scams using qr codes malware and ransomware these estimates reflect only known fraud and thefts it is likely that not all losses are reported and some amount of cryptocurrencies is lost or forgotten in most cases customers bear the losses by contrast over many decades consumers in the united states and euro area have come to expect strong safeguards on their bank accounts and the associated payments statutory and regulatory protections on bank accounts in the united states mean that consumers can reasonably expect their deposits to be insured up to a limit many fraudulent transactions to be the liability of the bank transfers to be available within specified periods and clear standardized disclosures about account fees and interest payments not only is it not clear whether comparable protections will be in place with libra or what recourse consumers will have but it is not even clear how much price risk consumers will face since they do not appear to have rights to the stablecoin s underlying assets anti money laundering aml counterterrorist financing ctf and know your customer kyc requirements are significant concerns in one industry report researchers found that roughly two thirds of the 120 most popular cryptocurrency exchanges have weak aml ctf and kyc practices 10 only a third of the most popular exchanges require id verification and proof of address to make a deposit or withdrawal this is troubling since a number of studies conclude that cryptocurrencies support a significant amount of illicit activity one study estimated that more than a quarter of bitcoin users and roughly half of bitcoin transactions for example are associated with illegal activity 11 there are also questions related to the implications of a widely used stablecoin for financial stability if not managed effectively liquidity credit market or operational risks alone or in combination could trigger a loss of confidence and run like behavior this could be exacerbated by the lack of clarity about the management of reserves and the rights and responsibilities of various market participants in the network the risks and spillovers could be amplified by potential ambiguity surrounding the ability of official authorities to provide oversight backstop liquidity and collaborate across borders the precise risks would depend on the design of the cryptocurrency as well as the scale of adoption the effect of a stablecoin on financial stability for example would be driven in part by how the stablecoin is tied to an asset if at all and the features of the asset itself a stablecoin tied one to one to an individual currency would have different implications than one tied to a basket of currencies a stablecoin that is built on a permissioned network would have different risk implications than a permissionless network which may be more vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing risks a stablecoin used solely by commercial banks would have a different risk profile than one for consumer use similarly there are potential implications for monetary policy for smaller economies there may be material effects on monetary policy from private sector digital currencies as well as foreign central bank digital currencies in many respects these effects may be similar to dollarization aside from the fast pace and wide scope of adoption the work ahead the emergence of cryptocurrencies and particularly stablecoins has raised important questions for central banks and other authorities including on the appropriate regulatory framework in the united states the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies is not straightforward our current framework is based largely on whether a cryptocurrency is deemed to be a security or has associated derivative financial products and whether the participating institutions have a supervisory agency overseeing their activities unlike many other jurisdictions regulators do not have plenary authority over retail payments in the united states moreover the regulatory challenges are likely to be inherently cross border in nature because stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies are unlikely to be bound by physical borders regulatory actions in one jurisdiction are unlikely to be fully effective without coordinated action elsewhere the prospect of global stablecoin payment systems has intensified the interest in central bank digital currencies central bank digital currency typically refers to a new type of central bank liability that could be held directly by households and businesses without the involvement of a commercial bank intermediary 12 proponents argue that central bank digital currencies would be a safer alternative to privately issued stablecoins because they would be a direct liability of the central bank a more relevant question may be whether some intermediate solutions may be able to offer the safety and benefits of real time digital payments based on sovereign currencies without necessitating radical transformation of the financial system in the united states there are important advantages associated with current arrangements physical cash in circulation for the u s dollar continues to rise due to robust demand and the dollar plays an important role as a reserve currency globally moreover we have a robust and diverse banking system that provides important services along with a widely available and expanding variety of digital payment options that build on the existing institutional framework with its important safeguards circumstances where the central bank issues digital currency directly to consumer accounts for general purpose use would raise profound legal policy and operational questions that said it is important to study whether we can do more to provide safer less expensive faster or otherwise more efficient payments some jurisdictions are likely to move in this direction faster than others based on the particular attributes of their payments and currency systems at the federal reserve we look forward to collaborating with other jurisdictions as we continue to analyze the potential benefits and costs of central bank digital currencies most immediately the federal reserve is actively working to introduce a faster payment system for the united states to improve the speed and lower the cost of consumer payments in many countries consumers are already able to make real time payments at low cost this summer the federal reserve announced the first new payment service in more than 40 years the fednow service to provide a platform for consumers and businesses to send and receive payments immediately and securely 24 hours a day 365 days a year as the public and private sectors work to reduce payment frictions one of the most important use cases is for cross border payments such as remittances current cross border payments solutions are often slow cumbersome and opaque authorities in many jurisdictions including the united states recognize the importance of cooperating across borders with each other and the private sector to address these cross border frictions 13 technology will continue driving rapid change in the way we make payments and the concept of money as central bankers we recognize the power of technology and innovation to transform the financial system and reduce frictions and delays and the importance of preserving consumer protections data privacy and security financial stability and monetary policy transmission and guarding against illicit activity and cyber risks given the stakes any global payments network should be expected to meet a high threshold of legal and regulatory safeguards before launching operations the work ahead is not easy the policy issues are complex the coordination challenges are significant and there are likely to be few simple fixes because the road ahead is complicated and challenging i am especially pleased that benoît will continue to help us navigate these issues as the new head of the bank for international settlements innovation hub 1 i am grateful to paul wong david mills theresa

i am honored to be here today to celebrate benoît coeuré s tenure at the european central bank ecb i have been working with benoît now for a decadeâ starting at our respective treasuries where we both were drafted as financial firefighters migrating to our respective central banks to help with stabilization recovery and normalization and most recently preparing for the challenges that lie ahead over the course of that decade i have developed deep admiration for benoît s keen insights and outstanding judgment 1 equally important benoît always has a plan generally it is the right plan addressed to the right problem and he executes it with exceptional efficacy and strong support that is a rare and invaluable combination in public service indeed benoît s tenure at the ecb coincided with an incredible turnaround in unemployment and output growth both the euro area and the global economy have benefited greatly from benoît coeuré s outstanding public service moreover benoît s research interests are forward looking and extend well beyond the macro economy when benoît was appointed chair of the committee on payments and market infrastructures cpmi the global standard setter for payment issues he doubled its output resulting in 75 reports 2 he turned its focus to distributed ledger stablecoins and central bank digital currencies long before many other central bankers realized these issues would be transforming their worlds indeed the number of google searches for central bank digital currencies increased sharply over the course of benoît s tenure as chair of the cpmi digital currencies money and payments i was asked to provide some brief thoughts about digital developments in the world of monetary policy and central banking at the start of benoît s ecb term bitcoin s market capitalization was small and only a handful of cryptocurrencies existed in the eight years since then bitcoin s market capitalization has grown rapidly and now exceeds 100 billion euros and thousands of cryptocurrencies have been created 3 the potential of global stablecoins to scale rapidly is evident from the increasingly fast rates of technology adoption and the growth of large networks adoption rates for new technologies have accelerated over time in 1921 35 percent of u s households had telephone service and it took 40 more years for telephone lines to reach 80 percent of homes in contrast the internet achieved the same level of adoption in only 13 years more recently smartphones and social media have achieved the same level of u s household adoption in less than a decade 4 rapid adoption is also evident in the payments landscape where network externalities figure prominently between the first quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2019 transactions through venmo grew over 66 times to 21 billion 18 5 billion euros 5 systems in other countries have also scaled rapidly in china mobile payments grew over 35 times during the same period to 8 2 trillion 7 2 trillion euros 6 india s unified payments interface upi has grown even faster between the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2019 the transaction value grew nearly 400 times to 49 7 billion 43 8 billion euros 7 digital currency payments projects from big technology firms that have network advantages have the potential to scale even more rapidly because the utility of any medium of exchange increases with the size of the network using it the power of a stablecoin payment system depends on the breadth of its adoption with nearly one third of the global population as active users on facebook the libra stablecoin project stands out for the speed with which its network could reach global scale in payments stablecoin networks at global scale are leading us to revisit questions over what form money can take who or what can issue it and how payments can be recorded and settled while central bank money and commercial bank money are the foundations of the modern financial system nonbank private money or assets also facilitate transactions among a network of users in some cases such nonbank private assets may have value only within the network while in other cases the issuer may promise convertibility to a sovereign currency such that this becomes a liability of the issuing entity stablecoins aspire to achieve the functions of traditional money without relying on confidence in an issuerâ such as a central bankâ to stand behind the money for some potential stablecoins a close assessment suggests users may have no rights with respect to the underlying assets or any issuer we have already seen the growth of massive payments networks on existing digital platforms such as alibaba and wechat so far these networks operate within a jurisdiction based on the sovereign currency as the unit of account and balances are transferable in and out of bank or credit card accounts we have also seen the issuance of stablecoins on a smaller scale such as gemini or paxos what would set facebook s libra apart if it were to proceed is the combination of an active user network representing more than a third of the global population with the issuance of a private digital currency opaquely tied to a basket of sovereign currencies 8 libra like any stablecoin project with global scale and scope must address a core set of legal and regulatory challenges a significant concern regarding facebook s libra project is the potential for a payment system to be adopted globally in a short time period and to establish itself as a potentially new unit of account unlike social media platforms or ridesharing applications payment systems cannot be designed as they develop due to the nexus with consumers financial security this is why in many jurisdictions including the european union there is a regime to oversee retail payment systems without requisite safeguards stablecoin networks at global scale may put consumers at risk cryptocurrencies already pose a number of risks to the financial system and these could be magnified by a widely accepted stablecoin for general use estimated losses from fraud and thefts associated with cryptocurrencies are rising at a staggering paceâ from 1 7 billion 1 4 billion euros in 2018 to over 4 4 billion 3 9 billion euros in 2019 based on one industry estimate 9 the hacking of exchanges represents a significant source of the theft followed by the targeting of individual users through scams using qr codes malware and ransomware these estimates reflect only known fraud and thefts it is likely that not all losses are reported and some amount of cryptocurrencies is lost or forgotten in most cases customers bear the losses by contrast over many decades consumers in the united states and euro area have come to expect strong safeguards on their bank accounts and the associated payments statutory and regulatory protections on bank accounts in the united states mean that consumers can reasonably expect their deposits to be insured up to a limit many fraudulent transactions to be the liability of the bank transfers to be available within specified periods and clear standardized disclosures about account fees and interest payments not only is it not clear whether comparable protections will be in place with libra or what recourse consumers will have but it is not even clear how much price risk consumers will face since they do not appear to have rights to the stablecoin s underlying assets anti money laundering aml counterterrorist financing ctf and know your customer kyc requirements are significant concerns in one industry report researchers found that roughly two thirds of the 120 most popular cryptocurrency exchanges have weak aml ctf and kyc practices 10 only a third of the most popular exchanges require id verification and proof of address to make a deposit or withdrawal this is troubling since a number of studies conclude that cryptocurrencies support a significant amount of illicit activity one study estimated that more than a quarter of bitcoin users and roughly half of bitcoin transactions for example are associated with illegal activity 11 there are also questions related to the implications of a widely used stablecoin for financial stability if not managed effectively liquidity credit market or operational risks alone or in combination could trigger a loss of confidence and run like behavior this could be exacerbated by the lack of clarity about the management of reserves and the rights and responsibilities of various market participants in the network the risks and spillovers could be amplified by potential ambiguity surrounding the ability of official authorities to provide oversight backstop liquidity and collaborate across borders the precise risks would depend on the design of the cryptocurrency as well as the scale of adoption the effect of a stablecoin on financial stability for example would be driven in part by how the stablecoin is tied to an asset if at all and the features of the asset itself a stablecoin tied one to one to an individual currency would have different implications than one tied to a basket of currencies a stablecoin that is built on a permissioned network would have different risk implications than a permissionless network which may be more vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing risks a stablecoin used solely by commercial banks would have a different risk profile than one for consumer use similarly there are potential implications for monetary policy for smaller economies there may be material effects on monetary policy from private sector digital currencies as well as foreign central bank digital currencies in many respects these effects may be similar to dollarization aside from the fast pace and wide scope of adoption the work ahead the emergence of cryptocurrenciesâ and particularly stablecoinsâ has raised important questions for central banks and other authorities including on the appropriate regulatory framework in the united states the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies is not straightforward our current framework is based largely on whether a cryptocurrency is deemed to be a security or has associated derivative financial products and whether the participating institutions have a supervisory agency overseeing their activities unlike many other jurisdictions regulators do not have plenary authority over retail payments in the united states moreover the regulatory challenges are likely to be inherently cross border in nature because stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies are unlikely to be bound by physical borders regulatory actions in one jurisdiction are unlikely to be fully effective without coordinated action elsewhere the prospect of global stablecoin payment systems has intensified the interest in central bank digital currencies central bank digital currency typically refers to a new type of central bank liability that could be held directly by households and businesses without the involvement of a commercial bank intermediary 12 proponents argue that central bank digital currencies would be a safer alternative to privately issued stablecoins because they would be a direct liability of the central bank a more relevant question may be whether some intermediate solutions may be able to offer the safety and benefits of real time digital payments based on sovereign currencies without necessitating radical transformation of the financial system in the united states there are important advantages associated with current arrangements physical cash in circulation for the u s dollar continues to rise due to robust demand and the dollar plays an important role as a reserve currency globally moreover we have a robust and diverse banking system that provides important services along with a widely available and expanding variety of digital payment options that build on the existing institutional framework with its important safeguards circumstances where the central bank issues digital currency directly to consumer accounts for general purpose use would raise profound legal policy and operational questions that said it is important to study whether we can do more to provide safer less expensive faster or otherwise more efficient payments some jurisdictions are likely to move in this direction faster than others based on the particular attributes of their payments and currency systems at the federal reserve we look forward to collaborating with other jurisdictions as we continue to analyze the potential benefits and costs of central bank digital currencies most immediately the federal reserve is actively working to introduce a faster payment system for the united states to improve the speed and lower the cost of consumer payments in many countries consumers are already able to make real time payments at low cost this summer the federal reserve announced the first new payment service in more than 40 yearsâ the fednow serviceâ to provide a platform for consumers and businesses to send and receive payments immediately and securely 24 hours a day 365 days a year as the public and private sectors work to reduce payment frictions one of the most important use cases is for cross border payments such as remittances current cross border payments solutions are often slow cumbersome and opaque authorities in many jurisdictions including the united states recognize the importance of cooperating across borders with each other and the private sector to address these cross border frictions 13 technology will continue driving rapid change in the way we make payments and the concept of money as central bankers we recognize the power of technology and innovation to transform the financial system and reduce frictions and delays and the importance of preserving consumer protections data privacy and security financial stability and monetary policy transmission and guarding against illicit activity and cyber risks given the stakes any global payments network should be expected to meet a high threshold of legal and regulatory safeguards before launching operations the work ahead is not easyâ the policy issues are complex the coordination challenges are significant and there are likely to be few simple fixes because the road ahead is complicated and challenging i am

withdrawal agreement bill that mps will sign off in january the stage is set therefore for brexit risk to dampen the economy again in the second half of next year this means that exports will continue to struggle as multinationals hold back from locating production facilities in britain and overseas firms give uk exports a wide berth given the risk to supply chains in the event of no deal analysts at pantheon economics said european commission chief ursula von der leyen warned that failing to rapidly negotiate a new trade deal after brexit would hurt the uk more than it would the eu the timetable ahead of us is extremely challenging she told the european parliament in strasbourg in case we cannot conclude an agreement by the end of 2020 we will face again a cliff edge this would

commentary fears that canada again was slipping into recession emerged when on the heels of a small dip in october jobs in november fell by the most for any month since the trauma of the 2008 09 global financial crisis such fears never far below the surface inevitably arose because these job losses coincided with growing uncertainty about the global economic outlook clearly there are worrying signs about global growth large parts of europe and japan have essentially stalled growth in china is the weakest in nearly three decades the trade war between china and the united states helped slow u s growth from above 3 percent last year to near 2 percent this year more broadly there are mounting doubts about the ability of political and economic leaders to deal with a recession all of the heads of government in north america and europe are untested in managing an economic downturn equally worrisome is the complete turnover in a very short time of the governors of central banks in europe the united kingdom the united states and canada this inexperience reduces their capacity to coordinate actions in the event of a financial or economic crisis so there are good reasons for ordinary canadians to be wary of a sharp deterioration in economic and financial conditions however so far there are not many clear signs that canada s economy is in recession real gdp has been sluggish in the past year with a growth of 1 7 percent but slow growth has persisted for most of the past decade without morphing into recession it would be highly unusual for canada s economy to turn down without being pulled under by the united states by far our largest trading partner growth in the united states remains positive even if less robust than just after the 2018 tax cuts the outlook for the u s economy entering 2020 is boosted by the new free trade deal signed with canada and mexico and strong signals from the white house that trade frictions with china are subsiding this removes a major source of uncertainty hampering business investment a stable u s economy is a major plus for canada entering the new year the macdonald laurier institute s leading indicator designed to track cyclical swings in our economy continues to post slow but steady growth in recent months financial market indicators such as the stock market and borrowing spreads in the credit market have not deteriorated as they usually do when the economy is under stress key sectors such as housing natural resources and manufacturing have not slumped in anticipation of weaker demand the most puzzling feature of canada s economy in 2019 was not slow gdp growth the inevitable result of weak business investment and manufacturing exports while high debt weighed down household spending the conundrum was how employment growth remained above 2 percent even as production and hours worked slowed the implication of slower growth in gdp than in the job market was substandard income gains this was reflected in the malaise canadians expressed about the economy during the recent federal election despite record low unemployment experience shows that when employers are not stepping up investment and output at some point employment demand tapers off this realignment of output and employment drove most of the correction in jobs in november not canada s entry into recession it is imperative that canada avoids a recession in the near term because of our historically high debt levels canada s aggregate debt to gdp ratio hit a record 304 percent in 2019 according to the latest bank for international settlements quarterly review this ratio takes into account the total debt owed by households government including the local provincial and federal levels and non financial corporations while most of the public s focus has been on high household debt which is just over 100 percent of gdp all sectors of the canadian economy have gorged themselves on debt in recent years with corporate and government borrowing each nearly equal to household debt it should be noted that the provinces have driven the increase in government debt all debt is perilous because debtors are vulnerable to two risks either a sharp increase in interest rates or the loss of employment or incomes the latter risk is the most worrisome for a highly cyclical economy like canada s within a slow growth environment that keeps interest rates low while the economy is not now in recession inevitably we will experience another slump more likely sooner than later we should direct exaggerated concern that a recession is already underway toward immediately undertaking structural reforms to boost growth potential and reduce our reliance on debt these steps will help canada weather the next downturn

president donald trump is heading into an election year touting a trade deal that promises to double u s exports to china which he says has pledged a us 200 billion two year spending spree on everything from airplanes to pork chops and chicken feet yet the inescapable reality is that even this extraordinary splurge if it happens may not make up the economic cost of the trade war it seeks to defuse the precise toll of an economic conflict that is far from over is difficult to isolate and is the result of everything from the direct cost of tariffs to intangibles like the role of uncertainty on business confidence it also gets at a theological debate in economics that sees ideological supporters of trump s tariffs argue prior waves of protectionism are unfairly maligned by history economists who have calculated the impact of u s tariffs most of which will remain in place and china s retaliatory measures have put the economic losses including the impact of the resulting uncertainty at a cost in lost output ranging from 0 3 per cent to 0 7 per cent of real gross domestic product this year alone but even with the phase one trade deal many economists expect the tariff drag to extend for years as stymied business investment lingering uncertainty and the billions of duties still in place take a toll on future growth while a few tenths of a percentage point may not seem like much it s consequential in the world s biggest economy in 2019 dollar terms bloomberg economics estimates the cost in lost u s gdp has reached us 134 billion to date and will rise to a total of us 316 billion by the end of 2020 a study by researchers at the new york fed and princeton and columbia universities estimated the cost to consumers of the bulk of tariffs that will remain in place despite the latest deal at us 831 per household per year or an annual cost of more than us 106 billion for the u s economy as a whole that alone would more than wipe out the gains from the chinese buying surge trump s team has negotiated the purchases get us back to where we were before this all started said maurice obstfeld former imf chief economist and member of president barack obama s council of economic advisers so you have to ask what s been gained and was it worth putting the economy through the wringer the costs are also not one time and are likely to build up for years based on economists calculations even as businesses get used to the tariffs or adjust supply chains and the initial deal helps at least calm fears of a further escalation the international monetary fund s estimates are that the u s tariffs will subtract from real gdp in every year to 2023 when real gdp will be 0 5 per cent lower than what it would have been had the duties not been imposed the congressional budget office earlier this year built its analysis on the assumption the tariffs could still be in effect in 2029 and subtract 0 1 per cent from u s economic output that year the administration and its supporters argue they are in a bigger fight to address longstanding american complaints with china that will be to the long term benefit of u s businesses and workers they point to a u s economy growing faster than its peers and continuing to generate plenty of jobs as vindication of its trade policies revised data on friday is expected to confirm the u s economy grew at a 2 1 per cent annualized rate in the third quarter in november the economy created a better than expected 266 000 jobs trump has also repeatedly denied any negative impact from his trade policies and instead blames what he portrays as a timid fed and a strong dollar for not allowing the u s economy to grow as fast as he would like there is no uncertainty he told the economic club of new york on nov 12 economic impact larry kudlow the head of trump s national economic council this week said he expected the combination of the deal with china which is due to be signed in early january and the imminent passage through congress of an update of the north american free trade agreement to add 0 5 per cent to u s growth kudlow s estimate is based on a mix of independent and internal analyses the white house says but it won t say any more it also has not released any analysis of the economic impact of the china deal or of the broader economic conflict a challenge facing critics of trump s trade wars is that the economic effects in the u s have been countered by strong national level data and the ability of a robust economy driven largely by domestic consumption to absorb the impact on the manufacturing and farm sectors but the negative effects are real argue economists like mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics from the third quarter of 2018 to the same quarter this year the period in which the trade war really started to bite zandi calculates the u s lost 0 4 per cent of real gdp to trump s various trade measures or us 88 billion it also lost 340 000 jobs to the trade wars he contends via a mix of stalled investment and higher costs due to new import duties the uncertainty affecting business decisions isn t evaporating zandi said and that will continue to weigh on business investment hiring and wage growth and will have continued negative consequences for the economy timber roadkill at northwest hardwoods the u s s largest exporter of timber used in everything from coffee tables to kitchen cabinets the impact of the trade war has been stark a toxic mix of new u s tariffs on furniture made in china that has hit demand there and chinese retaliatory duties has led to a 40 per cent collapse in an export business that for the u s industry was worth us 2 billion annually before the trade war said nathan jeppson the company s ceo we feel a bit like roadkill on this path he said the company has responded by shutting down plants in virginia and washington state laying off 225 of its 1 700 employees those jobs seem unlikely to return in a hurry u s trade officials have said an increase in sales of hardwoods to china will be part of the new buying spree they haven t provided any details though and jeppson can t commit to reopening anything we need to see a sustained recovery in demand and pricing in order to reinvest in any facilities or reopen any plants said jeppson we have been so badly hurt by the last year and a half that we are going to be very cautious

value of the rand we could attract a significant increase in the number of visitors which would help build entrepreneurial attractions accommodation and other opportunities within the tourism industry in kwazulu natal the introduction of direct flights between london and durban by british airways a year ago has resulted in an 11 increase in international passenger numbers in the year to september 2019 compared to the same period last year bolstering king shaka international airport s status as south africa s fastest growing international air gateway introduced this month december 2019 and with a flight time of just 14 5 hours the new direct flight between new york in the usa and cape town augurs well for tourism and foreign direct investment as the usa has a huge luxury travel market and according to wesgro has already resulted in an increase in forward bookings by us tourists to cape town for the summer season coupled with this the cape town rugby sevens currently taking place in the mother city 13 15 december 2019 is to be eclipsed by the world rugby hsbc sevens series in 2022 which is also hosted at the cape town stadium while england supporters are about to flock to our country s shores for the forthcoming cricket test matches versus the proteas further to this the 2021 british and irish lions tour will attract additional visitors to south africa tourism is recovering after the drought and aided by an easing of visa restrictions and piloting of an electronic visa application system coupled with increasing numbers of direct flights will bring more money translating into economic growth and jobs and more prospective buyers to the country it is hoped that economic growth will be slightly stronger next year despite risks to the downside so it is possible that 2020 may see a somewhat improved market than experienced this year certainly as the market does appear to be in the process of bottoming out supply is slowing in response to weak demand with fewer new houses and sellers keeping or removing homes from the market demand seems to be slightly stronger especially in the price band below r2 million so the market could edge back into equilibrium and then we will start to see signs of an improvement in the market in the new year young buyers there is strong demand for more affordable homes in cbds around the country this apartment in marshalltown johannesburg offers two bedrooms two bathrooms basement parking and city views it is priced at r645 000 click here to view young buyers remain a key positive for south africa s housing market ensuring a steady supply of new homeowners as we have a youth bulge with many eager to gain a foothold on the property ladder developers are responding with a marked shift in new housing stock towards sectional title homes although this is also a result of the shortage and cost of land and mixed use developments offering a live work play lifestyle close to places of work the recent introduction of micro units in cape town cbd and surrounds is also a response to strong demand from first time buyers who want a lock up and go lifestyle and to enjoy downtown living this has been a key driver behind the shift in housing in south africa from freehold suburban homes to mixed use precincts and developments and the rise of shared third spaces this is underlined by the strong demand for more affordable homes in cbds around the country with a large percentage of young buyers in johannesburg durban port elizabeth pretoria east london and bloemfontein and to a lesser extent cape town due to the cost factor developments with a growing number of young people looking for accommodation and with people of all ages and incomes showing an increasing preference for smaller more conveniently located homes and with the existing stock of homes predominantly freehold suburban houses there is plenty of reason for ongoing developments apartment living is growing in popularity and steyn city in midrand gauteng offers secure living amid acres of parkland this three bedroom two bathroom apartment is selling for r4 45 million click here to view while the overall number of new buildings may have slowed growth nodes continue to experience demand and developers are responding in areas such as pretoria the kwazulu natal north coast krugersdorp east london cape town the boland notably stellenbosch and somerset west and fourways for example steyn city there is also evidence of new residential units becoming available in mixed use precincts and buildings in cbds across south africa such as jewel city in johannesburg kzn remains an investment hub major investments announced during the sa investment conference include r6 5 billion by rio tinto in richards bay minerals r2 4 billion by toyota sa in its durban plant and the development of sa s first club med beach resort on the kzn north coast reportedly valued at r1 billion in addition the world s second largest beer brewer heineken is to set up a production facility on the north coast near dube tradeport with a r6 billion brewery to be built over the next two years the dube tradeport special economic zone sez recently received the coveted 2019 un investment promotions award for performing exceedingly well in promoting sustainable investment in kzn and south africa particularly facilitating the investment of r1 3 billion by mara phones it has also invested in transport infrastructure to improve the movement of goods and economic integration connecting major economic centres of johannesburg durban and richards bay with improved export capacity via sea ports and its air cargo facility the kzn north coast area is highly sought after among home buyers and there are currently nine new developments listed in umhlanga source property24 including 503 homes 457 being apartments and 46 freehold homes according to lightstone median prices of both freehold and sectional title properties in this region continued to strengthen in 2019 while activity remains relatively buoyant which is expected to continue in 2020 it s not only the kzn north coast which is seeing major investment amanzimtoti just south of durban is also experiencing an economic boom with the planned construction of kzn automotive supplier park in illovo and the kingsburgh industrial park the latter is set on the only available land that is zoned light industrial and commercial in toti and will be the largest industrial development the area has ever seen and is expected to create meaningful employment opportunities over a 20 year period according to lightstone both freehold and sectional title prices have continued to strengthen in amanzimtoti in 2019 even as sales activity slowed marginally in the larger sectional title market activity in the freehold market has strengthened in 2019 with 101 sales the highest since 2016 durban is also on the radar with billions being invested in inner city rejuvenation projects this one bedroom apartment in point waterfront is selling for r1 35 million click here top view the relative affordability of homes in the south coupled with the lifestyle offering suggests that it will continue to attract new residents and homeowners lightstone reports that 31 of recent buyers were young adults suggesting that first time buyers are attracted to the area the median price of a sectional title home in toti this year was r750 000 while that of freehold homes was under r1 5 million durban too is on the radar for investment with the announcement earlier this year of r62 billion being invested in inner city rejuvenation projects in the cbd in a partnership between local authorities and private business the live work play concept is also beginning to emerge in durban cbd with the privately owned company homii lifestyle launching its next phase of trendy highly secure and serviced apartments among durban inner city renewal investments are the r400 million extension of the durban promenade r2 billion mixed use development on the site of the old durban drive in r44 million rivertown development r2 8 billion retail mall and residential apartments and r240 million water mains project in mahatma gandhi road peripheries increasingly appealing apart from cbds and major centres peripheries of key nodes will continue to enjoy spill over of demand for example cape town s northern suburbs benefiting from waiting lists in southern suburbs schools and south peninsula in cape town as traditional suburbs in the cape metro become too expensive also new growth nodes are becoming increasingly popular such as george and pretoria east the latter with a huge number of new developments underway also gauteng east and west midrand the kzn highway corridor krugersdorp plettenberg bay and knysna the extension of the gautrain will also be important in benefitting peripheries as it will make new areas more attractive as commuting to work becomes easier roundabout brooklyn is a security development in nieuw muckleneuk pretoria and has apartments selling from r1 977 505 to r6 215 944 click here to view in cape town the rise of entrepreneurs and digital start ups is also benefiting different areas cape town has been named the digital hub of africa with the cbd woodstock and stellenbosch surrounds becoming home to a growing number of tech entrepreneurs and start ups continued demand coupled with limited land is resulting in densification with single freehold homes being replaced by several sectional title properties particularly evident in areas like newlands claremont and other southern suburbs meantime the deterioration of affordability in the sought after suburbs close to the mountain continues to benefit areas further afield such as northern suburbs and the western seaboard the rise of new growth nodes with retail and companies relocating to smaller nodes such as claremont westlake and somerset west stellenbosch becoming major growth hubs in their own right as it is possible to live in these areas without commuting to cape town the improvement of infrastructure such as myciti also increases the appeal of outlying areas such as along the western seaboard semigration this trend will continue with areas such as cape town s atlantic seaboard and city bowl set to benefit most from cape town s longstanding reputation as a prime global city while semigration to the garden route kzn and boland in the western cape is ongoing the garden route continues to attract semigrants from around sa this corner stand in kingswood golf estate george is selling for r950 000 click here to view there are also signs that semigrants who initially rented are beginning to purchase homes so while the semigration trend may have slowed to some extent it is still having a positive impact on the property market in areas where they have relocated congestion and the deterioration in affordability appear to be the primary reasons that semigrants began looking beyond the cape metro market for homes along the garden route and kzn going green apart from the wake up call from load shedding this month increasingly people are looking to add energy and water saving features to their homes to reduce monthly utilities costs and enhance value and climate change means that this will becoming a growing imperative where affordable this is likely to become a long term trend which will gather momentum in the years ahead and we anticipate this will also become more widely adopted in lower income housing as there is a growing realisation that green homes can be more cost efficient to run this is likely to occur in new developments which include greater energy and water efficiency and alternatives to municipal utilities

charge we might not be singing his praises quite so much photo by cole burston bloomberg article content by cornelius christian bank of canada governor stephen poloz who will be retiring when his seven year term ends next june often jokes about being compared with mark carney his more charismatic predecessor among laymen carney is widely admired for almost single handedly guiding canada through the 2007 8 world financial crisis and then steering the bank of england through the tempests of brexit poloz by contrast is mainly seen as boring in his speeches and interviews he is level headed and competent yet unexciting and avuncular not at all the international superstar carney was now that the dust has settled however the truth is clear even in comparison with his predecessor

s federal reserve s lead and cut interest rates though a standard move straight out of the central bankers textbook acting contributed to carney s celebrity carney himself admitted in a 2011 interview that the key difference during the crisis was canada s financial regulation including strict capital requirements and cmhc rules on mortgage securitization article content after his remarkable emigration in 2013 to take the governor s job at the bank of england carney s charm began to wear thin the british were initially starstruck offering him a 624 000 salary and a 250 000 housing

combination of skills by comparison stephen poloz has not been given enough credit sound central banking means being aware of risks both those the bank s models can forecast but also those the models cannot foresee poloz has been more honest about these uncertainties than carney who often slickly personified technocratic hubris poloz s risk aversion is apparent in his public worrying over rising consumer debt levels and possible real estate bubbles in toronto and vancouver both of which have the potential to trigger a significant economic downturn rare but consequential events are difficult if not impossible to predict using standard economic methods understanding that the bank of canada s power has limits and communicating them clearly has been part of poloz s success as a leader this good sense was on display during a december 2017 interview with cbc news despite a year of impressive job growth and economic recovery poloz remained cautious arguing that monetary policy should be thought of as risk management and not a simple mathematical exercise in which uncertainty can be assumed away in july of that year he raised the boc s key interest rate to 0 75 per cent he also drew concern towards excess labour capacity and climbing household debt levels since then poloz has also overseen relatively steady exchange rates despite donald trump s protectionism advertisement 4 story

briefing highlights illusion of strong economy stocks canadian dollar oil at a glance sun life to acquire majority of u k firm fiat psa in binding deal inflation in canada tops 2 per cent gm winds down in oshawa what analysts are saying today required reading illusion here s a holiday season thought for you no matter how you slice it canada has been entirely dependent on a debt binge to create the illusion of a strong economy that comes from david rosenberg chief economist at gluskin sheff associates who always has an interesting way of putting things mr rosenberg did not tie his comments to the holiday season by the way i did that because well it s the holiday season and we re talking about spending and debt in this case mr rosenberg was commenting in a research report to clients about the latest consumer and corporate debt numbers from statistics canada as the globe and mail s matt lundy reports those numbers last week showed the household debt burden or the ratio of credit market debt to disposable income rising in the third quarter to 175 9 per cent from a revised 175 4 in the second quarter this mr rosenberg noted came even as disposable income rose at another solid rate that being an annual pace of 3 8 per cent he cited the fact that mortgage credit is up by more than 4 per cent from a year ago and that it is the proliferation of non mortgage debt that is unprecedented credit market debt reached almost 2 3 trillion in the quarter of that mortgages accounted for almost 1 5 trillion and according to equifax canada defaults on non mortgage debt while still modest are now at their sharpest for a third quarter since 2012 if households ever reduce their borrowing this category will be the first to go and their consumption spending will go with it mr rosenberg said the bank of canada has been expressing concerns over the financial vulnerabilities posed by swollen household debt levels note too that the debt service ratio or how much of disposable income goes to debt payments is now at a record of about 15 per cent imagine that this is even higher than the financial obligations ratio two decades ago when interest rates were more than double today s level mr rosenberg said of that number you still have to repay that principal which represents a mountain of debt he said this explains why the canadian consumer will remain in slow growth mode for years to come with or without the trudeau liberals doling out more goodies to low and middle income households there really is no fiscal solution for the ever rising and unprecedented share of income devoted towards debt service payments we tend to focus on how consumers are faring in terms of debt but mr rosenberg noted that the news isn t any better for corporate canada which brought him to his suggestion of an illusion of a strong economy read more markets at a glance read more sun life to acquire majority of u k firm sun life financial inc is set to purchase a majority stake in

maire welcomed the move to bring together europe s second and third biggest car makers while adding the french government a key shareholder in psa would remain vigilant on matters including where decision centers are located within the new group read more inflation tops 2 per cent canada s annual inflation rate popped above 2 per cent in november but economists expect it will cool again next year the latest reading from statistics canada marked an increase from 1 9 per cent in each of august september and october this came as costs at the gas pump rose 0 9 per cent having tumbled a month earlier the acceleration to 2 2 per cent in annual inflation was largely the result of a soft comparison to a year earlier when gasoline prices were tumbling said cibc world markets senior economist royce mendes should gasoline prices remain stable the headline inflation rate should also cool back down in the second quarter of next year as the year ago comparisons become a bit firmer he added ticker china trims rate from reuters china s central bank lowered the interest rate on 14 day reverse repurchase agreements by five basis points following a similar reduction in the short term liquidity tool last month the people s bank of china said on its website that it was lowering the 14 day reverse repo rate to 2 65 per cent while keeping the seven day rate unchanged at 2 5 per cent the pboc unexpectedly trimmed the seven day lending rate in november for the first time in more than four years a signal to markets that policymakers are ready to act to prop up slowing growth gm

of england will not cut its main interest rate on thursday the office for national statistics said the largest downward push on the consumer price index came from accommodation services and tobacco while the largest upward contributions came from food and recreation and culture also what analysts are saying today volvo shares are in the spotlight on wednesday after japan s isuzu announced a collaboration between the two rival truck makers they will collaborate on electronification and autonomous driving it looks like a similar arrangement to that of bmw and jaguar landover these partnerships are a useful short term alternative to mergers and acquisitions we think this particular partnership probably has less scope to develop over time into a merger but the chances are now

the current situation as well as expectations among economic experts had declined significantly according to a quarterly released world economic survey by german research institute ifo in europe major economies including germany france britain and italy have all somewhat felt the headwinds of rising trade protectionism and economic nationalism at a time when uncertainties rise analysts worldwide are calling for a closer china europe relationship to create more positive factors in the global political economic landscape and inspire confidence in the world s future economic gloom in europe the european commission said earlier that euro area gross domestic product gdp is forecast to expand by 1 1 percent in 2019 and by 1 2 percent in 2020 and 2021 compared with its projections in july the growth forecast has been downgraded by 0 1 percentage point for 2019 and 0 2 for 2020 the european economy is now in its seventh consecutive year of expansion but the bloc now looks to be heading towards a protracted period of more subdued growth and muted inflation the commission said in a statement as europe s growth engine germany is expecting a gdp growth of only 0 5 percent for 2019 and 1 percent for 2020 last year the country s economy had grown by 1 5 percent the u s initiated trade conflicts are hampering global trade and investment activities said timo wollmershaeuser head of forecasts at the ifo this is hitting german industry particularly hard as it specializes in intermediate and capital goods the automotive sector one of the key industries in germany is also facing particular challenges he said besides analysts believe the resilience demonstrated from france s economic growth is mainly driven by domestic demand as growth forecasts for most of the country s economic partners are revised downwards amid protectionist pressures and brexit uncertainties tim moore economics associate director at global information provider ihs markit said that november s purchasing managers index surveys collectively suggest that the uk economy is staggering through the final quarter of 2019 with service sector output falling back into decline after a brief period of stabilization in italy the gdp is only expected to increase by 0 2 percent in real terms in 2019 compared with 0 9 percent in 2018 according to the italian national institute of statistics i think we ll see a substantial effect for specific sectors like parmesan cheese which is being taxed by the united states luca poma a professor of industrial economics and politics at the university of ferrara told xinhua in an interview there is also a risk that over time the impacts will accumulate global economy under pressure according to javier noriega chief economist with investment bankers hildebrandt and ferrar no corner of the global economy can escape the trade turmoil sparked by the united states stephen perry chairman of britain s 48 group club said that the world now knows the consequences of washington s moves in attempts to eliminate its trade deficit eliminating trade deficits is not a viable strategy on its own perry said adding that such moves by washington have weighed on the world economy the german council of economic experts which recently presented their annual report said that the weak economic momentum is expected to persist into next year at least an escalation of international trade conflicts would hit the export oriented german economy especially hard it added mao xuxin principal economist at london based economic think tank the national institute of economic and social research told xinhua in a recent interview that trade tariffs already imposed would cut world gdp growth rate by around 0 2 point compared to a baseline scenario without such tariffs and britain s economic growth rate would fall by 0 06 point the slowdown in economic activities has triggered a series of political responses from central banks in developed and emerging economies mao said within the emerging world the people s bank of china lowered the required reserve ratio in steps and the reserve bank of india injected stimulus into the economy with reductions in its benchmark policy rate following on from that the european central bank and the federal reserve signaled a delay in policy tightening he said call for closer china europe cooperation amid rising trade protectionism and a multitude of events that may further drag down global growth china and europe should join forces and work even closer together analysts suggested from a wider perspective the swirling trade issues might be good news for the economic relations between europe and china both of which have repeatedly expressed their support for free trade noriega said europe and china could turn toward each other to avoid the trade tariffs imposed by the united states he said according to perry the world economy is on a knife edge and china has been 30 percent of world growth growth is vital to the west china s growth is vital to the west it is time to build a new world based on cooperation and sharing a message sent by the new developing world he said we need more sharing of the benefits we do not need the u s to rebuild old walls we need new ways of cooperating he said michael schumann chairman of the german federal association for economic development and

editor s note bobby naderi is a journalist current affairs commentator documentary filmmaker and member of the writers guild of great britain the article reflects the author s opinions and not necessarily the views of cgtn after a historic call to action by president xi jinping last year china is spending billions of dollars to become a world leader in developing semiconductor silicon chips including nand dram cpus and gpus the world s largest importer and consumer of semiconductors has a vast electronics information market and there are many reasons why it has decided to reduce reliance on imports of the tiny devices shift into a higher gear in all aspects of the semiconductor silicon chips and allow for more competition in its semiconductor markets in the trade war era the u s has banned advanced equipment for sale to china that has formed the technological revolution despite a recent trade thaw the restrictive policy remains a bargaining chip in trade negotiations between the world s two largest economies the u s wants to throw china and its growing capabilities in revolutionary technologies under the bus it has restricted access to software semiconductors and ai related initiatives for firms like huawei and sensetime each year china imports some 200 billion u s dollars of semiconductors to power its smart devices consumer electronics and computing products the strategic industry requires billions of dollars in investment and has productivity gains in a range of sectors china cannot afford to ignore the high returns many emerging economies are dependent on china for technology and trade they perceive china s technological rise as positive and prefer having economic ties with the economic superpower china has launched a tech innovation board called the star market on the shanghai stock exchange to attract private capital and support talented entrepreneurs and start ups in ventures that provision the development of advanced chips china currently produces over 16 percent of silicon chips to compete for semiconductor leadership and make its economic relationship with emerging economies easier china plans to produce 70 percent of all semiconductors it uses by 2025 the country is one of the world s leading high tech hotspots and innovators a lesson learned from lingering trade friction is that the u s won t bargain its advanced chip technology chinese industry leaders have the upper hand when it comes to industrial base economic financial strength and quality of research and development the way to make the most of it is to allow more private businesses to power ahead with multibillion dollar projects in chip parks and compete with global peers and contract suppliers to be sure the asian superpower has to achieve self sufficiency in the critical semiconductor business seeing that last year it had a trade deficit in chips of 228 billion u s dollars to complicate matters trade friction is still there while the u s continues to restrict exports of chip technology to china it would be a historic blunder for its chip makers and technology firms to kick the can down the road and hope for the best no american chip maker or contract supplier will ever hold back on the strategic technology despite challenges and uncertainties however the public the private sector and the government are all ready for change in country semiconductor companies are competitive enough to close the technology gap substantially with highly specialized tools and cutting edge designs as well as meet the challenge of supplying the needs of domestic firms they have the required equipment materials and skills to develop competitive products at lower costs as per president xi s historic guidance and oversight the capacity is there to set actionable plans for manufacturing chipsets chinese manufacturers can make significant progress in the field and have a good chance to achieve leadership and standards setting power in the semiconductor industry there is no question that government policies support and promote such self reliance making sure private investors and professional manufacturers can build a world class chip industry and also be present in international markets the overwhelming conclusion is that it s now or never for the asian giant s private investors and leading producers of high end computer chips and specialist foundries to attain technological self sufficiency they have what it takes to build their own silicon valley and maximize the localization rate of advanced chips sino skeptics can rant until they are blue in the face but this is not a tale of getting mired down in the quicksand of debt strains and wishful thinking high end manufacturers in china have already made rapid headway in silicon chip design quantum communication supercomputing cryptocurrency and ai related initiatives they have dominated next generation technologies such as artificial intelligence and 5g far and wide having transformed a growing number of emerging economies on a titanic scale they can also develop their own semiconductor industry with comparable results

healthy monetary and financial conditions are vital for the stability and prosperity of societies with crucial responsibilities for setting interest rates shaping liquidity and stabilizing economies during crises central banks are at the heart of our collective efforts to maintain an orderly global monetary environment since the 2007 08 global financial crisis however we have entered an era of prolonged monetary disorder serving as firefighters major central banks in advanced countries all embraced unconventional monetary policies pushing interest rates down to near zero or even negative levels and injecting massive liquidity through quantitative easing with the aim of encouraging lending and real sector investment the results of such unconventional policies have been mixed and controversial as a short term expediency they helped to stabilize fragile financial systems and shore up economies in the midst of crises but they have not cured the underlying diseases and have generated many harmful side effects rather than effectively stimulating sustainable investment in the real economy and employment growth their primary effects have been on stimulating inflated asset markets fueling wide ranging booms in stocks bonds and real estate which have worsened wealth inequality and undermined social cohesion even more disturbing is the fact that these supposedly abnormal ultra loose monetary policies have arguably become a new normal for the global economy for over a decade now since the global financial crisis major central banks remain in firefighter mode despite some initial attempts to normalize their policy stances between 2015 and 2018 central banks have loosened their monetary policies again this year facing the prospect of economic slowdowns in particular the us federal reserve has cut interest rates three times by october reversing its rate increases in 2018 as trade tensions persist and global monetary easing renews its momentum the yield curve has inverted in many advanced economies which is often a sign that a recession is coming ultra low interest rates combined with a flood of liquidity inevitably distort financial markets according to the bank of international settlements the amount of bonds with negative yields have soared this year reaching a new high of over 17 trillion in the late august stock markets and property prices have continued to boom seemingly with the sky the limit investors are pushed to buy risky assets at high valuations with low prospective returns and often aggressively leveraging themselves up large corporations are more incentivized to conduct debt financed stock buybacks and acquisitions than making new long term investments to promote innovation meanwhile rising asset prices under

healthy monetary and financial conditions are vital for the stability and prosperity of societies with crucial responsibilities for setting interest rates shaping liquidity and stabilizing economies during crises central banks are at the heart of our collective efforts to maintain an orderly global monetary environment since the 2007 08 global financial crisis however we have entered an era of prolonged monetary disorder serving as firefighters major central banks in advanced countries all embraced unconventional monetary policies pushing interest rates down to near zero or even negative levels and injecting massive liquidity through quantitative easing with the aim of encouraging lending and real sector investment the results of such unconventional policies have been mixed and controversial as a short term expediency they helped to stabilize fragile financial systems and shore up economies in the midst of crises but they have not cured the underlying diseases and have generated many harmful side effects rather than effectively stimulating sustainable investment in the real economy and employment growth their primary effects have been on stimulating inflated asset markets fueling wide ranging booms in stocks bonds and real estate which have worsened wealth inequality and undermined social cohesion even more disturbing is the fact that these supposedly abnormal ultra loose monetary policies have arguably become a new normal for the global economy for over a decade now since the global financial crisis major central banks remain in firefighter mode despite some initial attempts to normalize their policy stances between 2015 and 2018 central banks have loosened their monetary policies again this year facing the prospect of economic slowdowns in particular the us federal reserve has cut interest rates three times by october reversing its rate increases in 2018 as trade tensions persist and global monetary easing renews its momentum the yield curve has inverted in many advanced economies which is often a sign that a recession is coming ultra low interest rates combined with a flood of liquidity inevitably distort financial markets according to the bank of international settlements the amount of bonds with negative yields have soared this year reaching a new high of over 17 trillion in the late august stock markets and property prices have continued to boom seemingly with the sky the limit investors are pushed to buy risky assets at high valuations with low prospective returns and often aggressively leveraging themselves up large corporations are more incentivized to conduct debt financed stock buybacks and acquisitions than making new long term investments to promote innovation meanwhile rising asset prices under current monetary conditions benefit wealthy individuals much more than the rest of the society credit suisse has estimated that the poorest half of the adult population collectively accounted for less

editor s note bobby naderi is a journalist current affairs commentator documentary filmmaker and member of the writers guild of great britain the article reflects the author s opinions and not necessarily the views of cgtn after a historic call to action by president xi jinping last year china is spending billions of dollars to become a world leader in developing semiconductor silicon chips including nand dram cpus and gpus the world s largest importer and consumer of semiconductors has a vast electronics information market and there are many reasons why it has decided to reduce reliance on imports of the tiny devices shift into a higher gear in all aspects of the semiconductor silicon chips and allow for more competition in its semiconductor markets in the trade war era the u s has banned advanced equipment for sale to china that has formed the technological revolution despite a recent trade thaw the restrictive policy remains a bargaining chip in trade negotiations between the world s two largest economies the u s wants to throw china and its growing capabilities in revolutionary technologies under the bus it has restricted access to software semiconductors and ai related initiatives for firms like huawei and sensetime each year china imports some 200 billion u s dollars of semiconductors to power its smart devices consumer electronics and computing products the strategic industry requires billions of dollars in investment and has productivity gains in a range of sectors china cannot afford to ignore the high returns many emerging economies are dependent on china for technology and trade they perceive china s technological rise as positive and prefer having economic ties with the economic superpower china has launched a tech innovation board called the star market on the shanghai stock exchange to attract private capital and support talented entrepreneurs and start ups in ventures that provision the development of advanced chips china currently produces over 16 percent of silicon chips to compete for semiconductor leadership and make its economic relationship with emerging economies easier china plans to produce 70 percent of all semiconductors it uses by 2025 the country is one of the world s leading high tech hotspots and innovators a lesson learned from lingering trade friction is that the u s won t bargain its advanced chip technology chinese industry leaders have the upper hand when it comes to industrial base economic financial strength and quality of research and development the way to make the most of it is to allow more private businesses to power ahead with multibillion dollar projects in chip parks and compete with global peers and contract suppliers to be sure the asian superpower has to achieve self sufficiency in the critical semiconductor business seeing that last year it had a trade deficit in chips of 228 billion u s dollars to complicate matters trade friction is still there while the u s continues to restrict exports of chip technology to china it would be a historic blunder for its chip makers and technology firms to kick the can down the road and hope for the best no american chip maker or contract supplier will ever hold back on the strategic technology despite challenges and uncertainties however the public the private sector and the government are all ready for change in country semiconductor companies are competitive enough to close the technology gap substantially with highly specialized tools and cutting edge designs as well as meet the challenge of supplying the needs of domestic firms they have the required equipment materials and skills to develop competitive products at lower costs as per president xi s historic guidance and oversight the capacity is there to set actionable plans for manufacturing chipsets chinese manufacturers can make significant progress in the field and have a good chance to achieve leadership and standards setting power in the semiconductor industry there is no question that government policies support and promote such self reliance making sure private investors and professional manufacturers can build a world class chip industry and also be present in international markets the overwhelming conclusion is that it s now or never for the asian giant s private investors and leading producers of high end computer chips and specialist foundries to attain technological self sufficiency they have what it takes to build their own silicon valley and maximize the localization rate of advanced chips sino skeptics can rant until they are blue in the face but this is not a tale of getting mired down in the quicksand of debt strains and wishful thinking high end manufacturers in china have already made rapid headway in silicon chip design quantum communication supercomputing cryptocurrency and ai related initiatives they have dominated next generation technologies such as artificial intelligence and 5g far and wide having transformed a growing number of emerging economies on a titanic scale they can also develop their own semiconductor industry with comparable results
richmond fed president tom barkin told cnbc on wednesday that he could reevaluate his stance on interest rates if major geopolitical issues such as the u s china trade war reach a resolution in 2020 i m very focused on the data if the uncertainty reduction leads to increased hiring increased investment increased pricing and therefore inflation that would be a welcome change barkin said on closing bell and as the data changes i may well change my outlook on rates barkin who joined the richmond fed in january 2018 referenced the uncertainty around the trade war the united kingdom s looming departure from the european union and the likelihood of the u s congress approving the renegotiated north american free trade agreement we have seen a lot of uncertainty over the last year year and a half and i do think that s been holding the economy back said barkin who is not a voting member of the federal open market committee which sets interest rates barkin s comments wednesday come hours after new york fed president john williams told cnbc he believed monetary policy is in a good place but as we ve proven in the past if economic conditions shift change in a material way obviously we re ready to adjust our policy views accordingly williams said in an interview with cnbc s steve liesman the fed has lowered rates three times this year most recently in october that stands in contrast to its handling of monetary policy in 2018 when it raised rates four times the last rate hike of 2018 contributed to a significant year end sell off in the stock market barkin said a fully executed phase one trade deal between the u s and china more clarity around brexit which may arise after u k prime minister boris johnson s large victory in last week s parliamentary elections and passage of the updated nafta could be a boon to the american economy i think we have an opportunity here if we can settle the uncertainty in the environment to allow us to grow said barkin who had previously been an executive at mckinsey co the privately held consulting firm he also served for six years on the board of directors for the atlanta fed from 2009 to 2014 when asked about criticism of the fed from president donald trump and others who believe interest rates should be even lower barkin said data on the american economy speaks for itself i think if you look at the numbers you d say we re doing about as well as any fed has ever done he said cnbc s jeff cox contributed to this report
cnn the decade is almost over and one incredibly volatile investment stood out from all the rest as the best of the 2010s want to guess what it was bitcoin according to a recent report by bank of america securities if you invested 1 in bitcoin at the start of the decade it would now be worth more than 90 000 a bitcoin is currently valued at about 7 000 while that s still significantly below its peak price of just under 20 000 two years ago it s substantially higher than the fractions of a penny that one bitcoin cost at the beginning of the twenty teens bitcoin remains a highly speculative investment but it has soared during the past decade as it emerged as the most popular and widely accepted cryptocurrency more retailers are accepting bitcoin as a form of payment and several investment firms and exchanges have launched futures trading for bitcoin a move that helped legitimize it and facebook s planned launch of the libra digital currency initiative has also further validated bitcoin and other crytpocurrencies in the minds of many investors the bofa report lists several other fun facts about what s been a wild decade for the markets one that has seen stocks recover from the depths of the great recession and hit new highs despite a trade war between the united states and china attacks on the federal reserve by president trump brexit concerns and a slowdown in europe as well as continued malaise in japan go usa but hope you avoided myanmar and greece although bitcoin has been the star investment of the 2010s anybody stuck with a spare kyat the local currency of myanmar won t be too happy ethnic conflicts violence and instability in the nation formerly known as burma have left a dollar invested in a kyat at the beginning of the decade worth just 4 tenths of one us cent today turning to stocks greece was not the word the mediterranean nation continued to struggle in the wake of its debt crisis bofa investment strategists michael hartnett and tommy ricketts noted in the report that 1 dollar invested in the greek equity market in 2010 is now worth only 7 cents the united states was the best stock market in the world with 1 in american stocks now valued at about 3 46 that s a gain of nearly 250 us bonds were also the best performers in fixed income a 30 year treasury that was worth 1 in 2010 is now valued at about 2 08 but greece s neighbor turkey had the worst bond of the decade a dollar in benchmark turkish bonds at the beginning of 2010 is now worth only 61 cents and many bonds no longer generate any income for investors at all negative interest rates have been good for gold but oil has languished several central banks around the globe have slashed interest rates to below zero to try and jumpstart sluggish economies as a result bofa said that 2019 had 17 trillion s worth of sovereign debt sporting a negative yield in 2010 no bonds had negative yields speaking of central banks it may seem like us fed chairs ben bernanke janet yellen and jerome powell have moved interest rates a lot during the past decade but they have nothing on brazil the brazilian central bank was the most active with 25 rate cuts and 24 rate hikes since 2010 the bank of japan was the quietest central bank it lowered rates once in the past ten years to negative territory in 2016 as interest rates have fallen investors have flocked to gold which was the top commodity of the 2010 1 of gold in 2010 is now worth 1 34 but crude oil was the worst commodity a dollar s worth of oil is now valued at just 74 cents the drop in oil prices in part because of sluggish demand and more supply from more american shale producers is a key reason why energy stocks were among the biggest dogs in the s p 500 during the past decade as well

the multi manager team headed by investment director and head of multi asset james menzies said the rise in volatility seen in recent years has led to valuations becoming increasingly stretched with the gap between value and growth now even wider than at the peak of the dotcom bubble against an investment philosophy of disciplined risk managed investing greystone seeks out attractive investment opportunities suited to various market conditions risk parameters and geographical bandwidths revealed the finalists for this year s specialist investment awards fidelity american special situations is one of their chosen funds with a greater value focus which has enjoyed a slight tilt in its direction in recent weeks the fund sits in the vt global growth portfolio alongside baillie gifford american bmo north american and merian north american equity as well as a us equity tracker from vanguard the global fund currently has 45 direct exposure to north american equity based funds with the polar capital global insurance fund which is a sector specialist but still invests mainly in us equities nudging the weighting closer to 50 other current us preferences appearing in both the balanced managed and global growth funds include artemis us extended alpha majedie us equity and polen capital focus us growth alternatives exposure elsewhere altrincham based greystone is favouring the opportunities presented by the alternatives space and in regional terms across asia and emerging markets menzies said the team has been overweight alternatives for some time expressed via physical property listed infrastructure and directional long short managers such as the european long short offering from carmignac and merian s global equity absolute return fund he favours alternatives to help offset broad equity and bond market risks and holds 24 in the conservative managed fund 21 in cautious managed and 22 in balanced managed meanwhile the team s core asian holding is tom naughton s prusik asian equity income fund whose strong track record of finding quality has made it a long standing inclusion across the range while the team does not deliberately seed funds avoiding the liquidity risk of holding too much of a fund s total assets naughton was one manager they supported from an early stage which has delivered excellent returns for the team why the us infrastructure sector has powerful tailwinds on the cards menzies is supported by james jackson as head of investment research and investment analyst chris jeavons and greystone also takes on a university intern each year the range also houses a cautious managed and conservative managed fund with roughly 300m in assets under management across the four funds the vehicles were initially launched in 2005 to serve greystone s internal client needs but are being rolled out externally another early purchase was the sdl uk buffettology fund run by keith ashworth lord of sanford deland menzies said we first invested when it was around 40m it is now over 1bn and we still hold it today the fund s consistency in its approach as a bottom up stock picker focusing on quality franchises and looking for strong company management teams makes it easier for us to work into a portfolio equity allocation overall the team s current equity exposure is 78 in balanced managed which sits in the ia mixed investment 40 85 shares sector and has been the biggest contributor to recent returns the allocation is split equally between uk and non uk equity funds menzies said he thought much of the negative newsflow hitting the uk had been priced into markets but acknowledged there was the potential for further falls if uncertainty remained at current levels he added in june 2016 markets headed into the uk s referendum relatively optimistic regarding the expected outcome of the vote which made the reaction to the actual result that much more severe despite sterling falling to a 31 year low versus the us dollar following the result our portfolios rose in value due to the extensive diversification we maintain we will continue to diversify our portfolios in order to offset short term bouts of volatility and maximise the long term growth potential the team s underweight to uk gilts and longer duration bond funds has held back returns recently but has served its purpose of dampening down volatility five dollar dynamics investors need to know beyond the uk menzies concern like many is centred on the slowdown of global economic growth us china trade tensions central bank monetary policy and other geopolitical risks on fees he defended his traditional fund of funds approach for bringing lesser known specialist fund managers that are not as readily available on platforms to clients the extra layer of oversight lets us invest in the best of these managers while avoiding the pitfalls well known recent events have shown that these do exist even for fund investors he added while traditional active management introduces additional costs we believe that over the long term we can offer better risk adjusted returns for our investors over five years to 30 september greystone balanced managed

not that long ago there was a broad political consensus that a fair and efficient tax system has a broad tax base and low tax rates the grand bargain was no special interest loopholes and low tax

carve outs nearly every senate democrat including ted kennedy al gore joe biden bill bradley and howard metzenbaum voted for this new system the tax reform worked economist dale jorgenson then the chairman of the harvard economics department estimated that the net present value of the 1986 tax reform act was well above 1 trillion to the economy because of lower tax rate penalties across the board politicians and the american voters had experienced the wreckage to the economy in the 1970s when tax rates stood as high as 70 percent the result was one of the worst decades for real middle class incomes since the great depression skyrocketing unemployment and a stock market that lost more than 60 percent of its value after inflation from 1968 to 1982 working class americans saw their retirement savings liquidated right before their eyes high tax rates were not the only economic malady of that malaise decade but they played a big part there was another practical reason for chopping tax rates down as the rich found all sorts of clever and legal ways around paying those high tax rates when the highest tax rate was between 70 percent and 90 percent the wealthiest 1 percent of americans paid less than 20 percent of the income tax burden today with a tax rate of 37 percent the rich pay almost 40 percent of the income tax burden high tax rates failed to soak the rich because they sheltered their income from taxes after both the kennedy and reagan tax cuts reported taxable income by those in the highest income tax bracket almost doubled in less than a decade all of this recorded history has been lost among current liberal politicians and academics elizabeth warren bernie sanders and many others are longing for a return to the era of punitive tax rates on the rich as a way to reduce income inequality economist emmanuel saez of the university of california argues we should go back to 70 percent tax rates since they worked so well the last time we imposed them in the 1950s and 1960s when tax rates were as high as 90 percent the economy was mostly prosperous but the rich never paid those tax rates effective tax rates were actually much lower this was also an era before the birth of the 2 trillion modern welfare and regulatory state and the taxes to pay for it medicare medicaid and the payroll taxes to pay for them did not even exist back then in those glory days when president kennedy cut the tax rate from 90 percent to 70 percent the economy soared during the 1960s growth rates zoomed to 6 percent when president reagan chopped rates from 70 percent to 50 percent to 28 percent the economy saw another burst of prosperity that former wall street journal editor robert bartley dubbed the seven fat years the business tax cuts under president trump have contributed to the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years and the biggest middle income gains in at least two decades high tax rates did not work in the 1970s but they will be even more harmful in the 21st century what is different today from 50 years ago is globalization with jobs businesses and investment capital flow to places in the world where after tax returns are highest if we raise the income tax rate to above 50 percent businesses and investment capital will flee to lower tax jurisdictions ask nations like france or greece or venezuela what happened to their economies when they devised new wealth tax systems to soak the rich or look at the massive losses of people and income from high income tax states like new york new jersey rhode island connecticut illinois and even california these states are bleeding wealth as residents relocate to low tax haven states like tennessee arizona florida texas and utah does senator sanders really want to make us look like connecticut where localities are banning homeowners from posting for sale signs because the mad rush to leave is crushing real estate values an even worse idea is higher estate and wealth taxes this has never worked the united states has an estate tax of roughly 40 percent to extract money from the bill gates warren buffets and tom bradys of the country however it generates only about 1 percent of federal tax receipts and many studies find that the deadweight loss to the economy far exceeds the value of the tax collected even communist and socialist countries like russia and sweden have given up and repealed their estate taxes because they were harming their economies so noticeably what do they know that senator sanders does not soak the rich tax policy is not an economic growth or jobs strategy it is an economic envy platform that was abandoned in the 1970s because this tale of high taxes on the rich and an expanded welfare state only drove down everyone in the country only a very poor student of history and there are far too many of them in washington and in academia would want to reprise that model which drove the american economy to its knees

through the first three quarters of 2019 sales of new motorcycles in india were down about 1 5 million units compared to 2018 to put that into perspective the nine month decrease was six times the size of harley davidson s global annual unit sales thousands of workers were laid off and one honda plant was shut down temporarily to reduce inventory why does it look like the world s largest motorcycle market is crashing and why are some experts still not worried the motorcycle market in india is huge to put the changes in perspective more than 20 million new motorcycles were sold in india in 2018 companies such as hero bajaj tvs and mahindra little known in the united states are huge and honda yamaha and suzuki build motorcycles and scooters specifically for india to give just one example in the month of september hero sold 750 000 units which is almost 50 percent more than all the motorcycles sold by all brands in the united states in an entire year india is now the largest motorcycle market in the world photo by nomad motorcycle sales in india surpassed sales in china as these companies saw year over year double digit percentage growth with some years up by 20 percent or even 30 percent this year however the indian domestic market will shrink by about 10 percent thousands of contract workers were laid off and a factory that builds the fantastically popular honda activa scooter was closed altogether for a few days to reduce the number of bikes in the distribution network and at dealers the india market is so huge it can affect the results of international motorcycle companies if sales there are weak to find out what was going on i used social media to contact writers covering the automotive sector in india starting with vaishali dinakaran a talented motoring journalist who introduced me to shubhabrata marmar the man she described as the best motorcycle journalist india has to offer shubhabrata shumi marmar has been covering the two wheeler scene in india for more than 20 years photo by ishaan bhataiya shumi as marmar is known has covered the indian scene for 20 years he s currently the motorcycle editor of powerdrift india s top youtube automotive channel which has nearly two million subscribers shumi described a series of factors that led to this year s collapse in sales but despite the turmoil he remains optimistic about the industry the first thing you need to understand is that the fundamental need for two wheelers has not changed he told me we don t have public transport so you need two wheels to get around the kids are still interested in two wheelers too look at our advertisements whether the ad s for a shirt or a housing development there will be a motorcycle in there in movies actors still ride motorcycles all this gives me confidence that the market will come back but a series of government moves have impeded the market shumi told a tale of a series of well meaning but sweeping government regulations that had surprise unintended consequences it began in late 2016 when the indian government implemented demonetization that is to say it took the two largest denomination banknotes out of circulation and restricted the use of cash in large transactions following that the cost of new motorcycles was pushed upwards by rules that mandated abs on most models and forced consumers to pay for five years of liability insurance up front costs will go up again in april 2020 when new emissions regulations take force that are even stricter than those in europe or california starting next spring india will have the world s tightest motorcycle emissions standards those weren t the only factors that led to this year s sales drop but they set the stage demonetization and emissions sunny soral is an engineer who worked in the indian automotive sector for a decade before shifting gears to become a content producer photo by sunny soral to dive deeper into the details i spoke at length with executives at two motorcycle manufacturers both of whom requested anonymity because they weren t authorized to speak for their employers and i talked to sunny soral an engineer who worked in the automotive sector for over a decade before shifting into online journalism and content creation the government pursued demonetization to try to eliminate black money transactions that avoided taxation to hamper criminal enterprises and to impede funding of terrorism existing 500 and 1 000 rupee banknotes had to be turned in to banks and were replaced with new 500 and 2 000 rupee bills despite a communications campaign in advance implementing the change was a challenge because most indians didn t even have bank accounts as an idea it was a bright thing to do soral explained but 85 percent of the money in circulation was in cash the women of the houses were saving that money they had it all hidden away somewhere there was no time for industry to adapt he added it killed off real estate and the auto sector too it destroyed the economy our gdp had been growing at 8 1 percent and 18 months later it was 4 5 percent even though the most popular motorcycle models still sell for under 1 000 u s that is about 60 percent of the average buyer s annual income so almost all buyers have to borrow money on the face of it then increasing access to organized banking seems like a good thing for the motorcycle business over there and could prove to be a good thing over the long haul but as shumi told me our government is good at optics but not so great at actually getting things done as part of the new regulations the government disrupted two other important sources of credit small scale cash loans made within families or villages and more formal loans made by so called non bank financial companies the largest of those actually went bankrupt then there s this bs as shumi mentioned the cost of new bikes rose because india made abs mandatory on all powered two wheelers over 125 cc bikes under that displacement limit need only be equipped with combined braking systems but even that change increased manufacturers costs which were passed on to consumers and the government now requires buyers to pay for five years of third party liability insurance up front those factors are small compared to the next big change however air pollution is a serious issue in india the world health organization ranks delhi as the city with the world s worst air pollution csc mktg photo effective april 1 2020 new motorcycles must meet an emissions standard known in india as bsvi bs stands for bharat stage and the vi is six in roman numerals technically it s very similar to euro 5 but even stricter in some ways urban air quality in india has reached dangerous levels so the government recently decided to leapfrog the expected change to bsv and jump straight from the current standard bsiv to bsvi this means that manufacturers that want to sell into india s domestic market will have to meet the world s tightest emissions standard that will bump prices up again sunny soral did a quick back of the envelope calculation for me and guessed that prices of the most popular models will have increased about 30 percent by the time all those changes have been accounted for what s worse the communications around the new rules have been misunderstood out in the countryside where potential buyers did not understand that motorcycles purchased before april 1 would be grandfathered in potential buyers worried that come april 1 earlier models would be taken off the road altogether many decided to postpone new purchases until bsvi models hit the market in march as a result it s been reported that inventories are piling up at dealers and in the distribution network shumi told me that the last time there was a step up in emissions standards when india went from bsiii to bsiv there was huge confusion over whether the rule meant that no bsiii machines could be manufactured after a certain date or couldn t be sold at retail after the deadline the courts eventually ruled the deadline applied to retail sales and manufacturers and dealers became desperate to sell off existing bsiii inventory there were deals like buy one at 30 percent off get the next one free this time manufacturers know how the rule will be interpreted so there s no excuse for being caught off guard both shumi and sunny soral gave me the impression however that dealers and distribution chains are saddled with too many bikes and have too little time to unload them before the deadline inventory levels may vary from company to company of course both of the executives i spoke to told me that they didn t know about competitors but they assured me that their brands dealers had strong sales during the recent diwali festival period that s the indian retail sector s equivalent of christmas that helped reduce inventories and both said that the companies they work for have reduced production by as much as 15 percent in the last couple of months to ensure they can sell through the last bsiv bikes and avoid the extreme discounting that preceded the last transition one exec admitted however that the transition to bsvi was not going to be easy many popular models that were made with carburetors now need electronic fuel injection even global tier 1 suppliers like keihin and magneti marelli can t easily satisfy indian manufacturers huge appetite because of supply chain problems manufacturers are focusing on their most popular models first and for a while this spring some less popular models won t be sold at all though motorcycles outsell scooters in india the single most popular nameplate is the honda activa scooter even in 2019 a slow year honda will sell about 1 5 million of these honda motorcycle and scooter india photo it never rains but it pours there are a lot of motorcycles in indian cities but even more are sold out in the countryside where the economy is still dependent on agriculture indian farmers are in turn dependent on monsoon rains on top of all the unintended consequences of government policies the last few years have had sub par monsoon seasons resulting in disappointing harvests as one executive explained to me the average buyer of a sub 150 cc motorcycle the most popular category in india hangs on to that bike for about five years then he sells it to someone who uses it for another five years it s easy for the average user to delay his next purchase a year or two and manufacturers expect that many buyers will defer purchases whether they are saving up more money to offset higher costs or hoping for good rains and better crop yields in 2020 despite all these economic headwinds both of the execs i spoke to were like shumi confident that the market would rebound in a couple of years one of them told me that by his estimate indian motorcycle manufacturers had only achieved about 25 percent penetration of the domestic market there s still huge growth potential out in the villages the hero splendor is the best selling motorcycle in india this 110 cc version including mandatory insurance currently sells for about us 850 the indian market is maturing however and there is an increasing demand for larger displacement motorcycles hero motocorp photo the biggest indian motorcycle manufacturers also export a lot of machines and have factories in other countries that are not subject to the vicissitudes of the indian market that diversification will help them weather this temporary albeit significant downturn one exec told me that while south america and africa both have their own issues like rampant inflation and political instability the long term forecast for those markets is very bullish too higher emissions standards aren t the end of the government s interventions either as it set a target for the automotive sector to make 30 percent of its sales electric vehicles by 2022 no one i spoke to thinks that s remotely achievable especially while countless millions of indians still don t have access to reliable electricity it would not even be that beneficial in a country that still relies on coal burning power plants the government has also long flirted with a 15 year scrapping rule that would take all older vehicles off the road one exec told me that in his opinion that rule would become law within the next few years too it is said there are 33 million gods in hinduism alone to say nothing of the fact that every other religion is also practiced in india gods only know what other unintended consequences will affect the world s largest motorcycle market
by dr amer k hirmis any opinions expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of iraq business news private sector investment in iraq what strategy for the next prime minister iraq is in turmoil the protests of the iraqi youth which started on october 1st 2019 are calling for the end of corruption inequality in income distribution high unemployment and the current ethno sectarian political system and outside interference they are also calling for a better life and metaphorically for their own country watan the protests have so far claimed the resignation of adel abdul mahdi the outgoing prime minister the appointment of a new prime minister is imminent however it is not certain whether president barham salih or indeed the current parliament itself will remain in place for a long time the system they are part of has failed politics aside this situation compounds an already unfavourable environment for doing business in iraq as strongly indicated in a recent world bank report oct 2019 political instability uncertainty and indecision provide no comfort for the private investor there are however a number of reasons why the next prime minister should be bold and determined to make fundamental changes to encourage private sector investment there is a need to ameliorate the severe structural problems in iraqi economy to lessen its dependence on oil exports the enormous challenges they face include high youth unemployment at ca 25 percent young population 60 percent under 30 years of age and growing at around 3 percent pa over 700 000 people entering the labour market each year hundreds of thousands of senior schools and university graduates to mention a few they must act fast deep and wide none of these challenges is easy the new prime minister must be willing to make economic development in the face of adversities new strategies are a must reversing old ways of doing things this brief note provides a few suggestions relating to what the next prime should do to induce domestic and foreign private investment in the economy first though history the graph below shows the dominance of public sector investment gross fixed capital formation over the last 50 years the decline in private investment intensified following the 1964 nationalisation of major private sector concerns in industry banking and commerce private sector s share of non oil gdp declined from 87 3 percent in 1950 to 62 5 percent in 2010 hirmis a k 2018a 57 it was 61 8 percent in 2017 cosit gov iq n accounts 2018 p 10 structure and ownership the private sector s role in the economy has been relegated for nearly 60 years now its previously wide ranging economic activities have now been confined to mainly in retail and trade construction transport and ict crafts and light industry are the province of the private sector the majority of businesses are owned by sole proprietors with the rest being largely family partnerships the country has few large multi industry conglomerates however large private businesses are emerging in ict particularly mobile communications in technical services for the oil and gas sector and in manufacturing productivity in the private sector varies iraqi private firms perform better in this regard than others in the mena region in textiles and garments chemicals pharmaceuticals non metals and equipment by contrast food processing and electronics have a relatively low level of productivity wb 2017 wb 2019 and roi 2014 41 apud idris i 2018 skills and education as christine van den toornhas 2019 has remarked a key first step will be education reform to prepare young iraqis for private sector employment it is clear that the issue is not a lack of demand a lack of training in basic business skills such as finance and accounting and a lack of core professional abilities from critical thinking research and report writing to being able to work with common software programs this points to the urgent need to completely overhaul the public education system including modernizing the curriculum short term solutions include a nationwide series of accredited specialized one or two year programs that focus on developing language business and professional competencies back in 2003 nancy birdsall 2003 61 had observed that development and democracy require a fast uptake of iraqis including girls and women into secondary school they require replacing a school system focused on doctrinal propaganda with a system responsive to new demands for marketable skills the wider issues second the wider issues facing any future iraqi prime minister in relation to inducing private sector investment go beyond industry structure ownership skills and education noted above the next prime minister should have a robust and realistic vision for iraq s economy and its characterisation they should decide for example whether they wish to build a capitalist market economy where the private sector plays a key role whilst government plays an enabling role for wealth and jobs creation especially in the productive sectors like manufacturing and agriculture on this point government has dithered since 2003 now there is an opportunity to decide on the character of the iraqi economy going forward the prime minister and his advisors should critically have clear views of the dynamics of private sector performance the business environment needed for investment to take place and for firms to operate successfully private investment takes place on a very simple and familiar premise the anticipated reward is worth taking the risk i e reward vs risk on the investment side the world bank s october 2019 report on doing business 2020 iraq clearly shows why both the domestic and foreign private investors are weary and reticent iraq fails on all the measured indicators used to assess the business environment the ease of doing business iraq currently does not provide a favourable business environment these indicators include getting electricity registering property obtaining credit enforcing contracts and inter alia resolving insolvency iraq came 172nd out of 190 countries very close to the bottom in short the next prime minister and his advisors must rise to an enormous challenge and this is one of the yardsticks for judging the success or failure of the next prime minister s administration on the side of operation and performance the latter typically depends essentially on eight factors both internal and external to the firm as shown in the figure below economic history of market economies shows that growth is generated mainly by the private sector the government plays an enabling role through its economic policies regulation support for innovation and trade and ensuring political stability within a democratic framework government also subsidies and regulates education health services and physical infrastructure however regardless of the stage of economic development a number of factors come together to influence both private investment level structure and the performance of the firms as indicated above firms also need to consider in detail their profit and loss accounts in the process of making profits if they do firms typically make allowances for wages interest bearing loans or equity raised privately or from commercial state banks in addition taxation dividends retained earnings are also considered decisions on these matters constitute part of the firm s behaviour and could affect its future direction e g expansion diversification or even closure in the case of iraq there is also a consensus amongst observers that tackling corruption bureaucracy and doing without an ethno sectarian system of government is critical for economic development corruption bureaucracy and cronyism deny many qualified potential employees access to jobs they deserve to have security and political stability are also a must for sustained private investment in other words a large number of factors need to be taken into account in balancing the rewards versus the risks at the firm level the new iraqi government must account for this finally at the strategic macro level the new prime minister has at least three options to stimulate private sector investment accounting for the eight factors noted in the figure above option one is to introduce a radical and swift reform concerning doing business in iraq creating a conducive environment to induce private investment by removing constraints facing it the new prime minister would be well advised to take a leaf from the world bank s recommendations for doing business in iraq they should also take a leaf from the government s own private sector development strategy 2014 2030 which recommends amending current laws and regulations governing the private sector which impede the sector s growth these include investment law 13 of 2006 company law 21of 1997 industrial development law 164 of 1964 implementation of large projects law 157 of 1973 and the economic establishment law 98 of 1964 on the other hand the private sector investors should observe the rule of law especially the labour law 37 2015 the new prime minister should also seriously consult with iraqi chambers of commerce and confederations of industry to develop an awareness of their concerns aspirations and the dynamics of their performance option two is to start with restructuring and rejuvenating the state owned enterprises soes to improve their productivity keeping in mind the socio political impacts this option might have the soes most of which are dysfunctional and inefficient assume a drain on government s budget due to underemployment redundancy and maladministration the soes have also assumed control over the sectors concerned and in effect crowded out most non oil private firms wb 2017 the new prime minister could introduce a form of partnership with the domestic or foreign private sector to rejuvenate the soes based on say 30 40 years lease profit sharing joint operation ensuring continuous professional development for iraqi workers and continuous research and development r d when in operation major ventures should be linked with iraqi foreign universities to encourage innovation such partnership arrangements do not have to take the form of bot build operate transfer or boot build own operate transfer business models a new model could be struck having the advantages of minimizing public cost for investment reducing public debt allowing for innovation improving productivity especially via fdi foreign direct investment and improve good governance transparency etc these arrangements could be applied to the manufacturing agriculture and physical infrastructure of the economy to start with option three is to widen the remit of the proposed construction council which the current new parliament will consider in the form of a construction council bill this was forwarded by cabinet to parliament on september 17 2019 for the bill to induce private investment its current objectives and mechanisms need fundamental review and amendments to widen its remit so that smes could for example gain access to finance also the bill must not become another mechanism to further corruption and money laundering it must ensure that council works on strictly professional basis avoiding the politicisation of its remit work critically the new construction council must be regulated by say a new independent office for economic development responsibility oedr ensuring that council performs and delivers major sme projects efficiently and effectively this means that the operator must not be the regulator which is the case in many iraqi institutions at present otherwise the seeds of corruption will be easily sown on this basis the new prime minister could make a real difference and amend the current broken system of doing business in iraq of course the above three options are inextricably linked indeed they could be implemented in parallel in all these options education and economic development must be strongly linked as noted above university and vocational training graduates need to end up in jobs created by expanding productive and service sectors taking advantage of the digital revolution in short there must be close link between education curricula and the skills needs in the labour market all girls and boys should have access to education to advanced level up 16 18 of age so that they would make informed decisions for themselves in life and in participating in the labour market hirmis a k 2018b this is especially important at the micro firm level ensuring the skills required are provided in summary the new prime minister will be faced with many challenges noted above and none is easy stimulating private sector investment is one area where they can turn these challenges into opportunities the new prime minister will need to muster great wisdom and determination to rise to these challenges and assist in wealth and jobs creation learning from iraq s own history and also from foreign experience in economic growth is always rewarding the new prime minister should seek well reasoned workable advice and apply it in the iraqi context this is one way of enhancing state craft iraqis will be watching the new prime minister very closely and will demand results end key references birdsall n 2003 the real challenge for iraqi development in the international economy fall 2003 58 61 christine van den toornhas 2019 the answer to iraq s

editor s note bobby naderi is a journalist current affairs commentator documentary filmmaker and member of the writers guild of great britain the article reflects the author s opinions and not necessarily the views of cgtn after a historic call to action by president xi jinping last year china is spending billions of dollars to become a world leader in developing semiconductor silicon chips including nand dram cpus and gpus the world s largest importer and consumer of semiconductors has a vast electronics information market and there are many reasons why it has decided to reduce reliance on imports of the tiny devices shift into a higher gear in all aspects of the semiconductor silicon chips and allow for more competition in its semiconductor markets in the trade war era the u s has banned advanced equipment for sale to china that has formed the technological revolution despite a recent trade thaw the restrictive policy remains a bargaining chip in trade negotiations between the world s two largest economies the u s wants to throw china and its growing capabilities in revolutionary technologies under the bus it has restricted access to software semiconductors and ai related initiatives for firms like huawei and sensetime each year china imports some 200 billion u s dollars of semiconductors to power its smart devices consumer electronics and computing products the strategic industry requires billions of dollars in investment and has productivity gains in a range of sectors china cannot afford to ignore the high returns many emerging economies are dependent on china for technology and trade they perceive china s technological rise as positive and prefer having economic ties with the economic superpower china has launched a tech innovation board called the star market on the shanghai stock exchange to attract private capital and support talented entrepreneurs and start ups in ventures that provision the development of advanced chips china currently produces over 16 percent of silicon chips to compete for semiconductor leadership and make its economic relationship with emerging economies easier china plans to produce 70 percent of all semiconductors it uses by 2025 the country is one of the world s leading high tech hotspots and innovators a lesson learned from lingering trade friction is that the u s won t bargain its advanced chip technology chinese industry leaders have the upper hand when it comes to industrial base economic financial strength and quality of research and development the way to make the most of it is to allow more private businesses to power ahead with multibillion dollar projects in chip parks and compete with global peers and contract suppliers to be sure the asian superpower has to achieve self sufficiency in the critical semiconductor business seeing that last year it had a trade deficit in chips of 228 billion u s dollars to complicate matters trade friction is still there while the u s continues to restrict exports of chip technology to china it would be a historic blunder for its chip makers and technology firms to kick the can down the road and hope for the best no american chip maker or contract supplier will ever hold back on the strategic technology despite challenges and uncertainties however the public the private sector and the government are all ready for change in country semiconductor companies are competitive enough to close the technology gap substantially with highly specialized tools and cutting edge designs as well as meet the challenge of supplying the needs of domestic firms they have the required equipment materials and skills to develop competitive products at lower costs as per president xi s historic guidance and oversight the capacity is there to set actionable plans for manufacturing chipsets chinese manufacturers can make significant progress in the field and have a good chance to achieve leadership and standards setting power in the semiconductor industry there is no question that government policies support and promote such self reliance making sure private investors and professional manufacturers can build a world class chip industry and also be present in international markets the overwhelming conclusion is that it s now or never for the asian giant s private investors and leading producers of high end computer chips and specialist foundries to attain technological self sufficiency they have what it takes to build their own silicon valley and maximize the localization rate of advanced chips sino skeptics can rant until they are blue in the face but this is not a tale of getting mired down in the quicksand of debt strains and wishful thinking high end manufacturers in china have already made rapid headway in silicon chip design quantum communication supercomputing cryptocurrency and ai related initiatives they have dominated next generation technologies such as artificial intelligence and 5g far and wide having transformed a growing number of emerging economies on a titanic scale they can also develop their own semiconductor industry with comparable results
