via carnegieendowment debt is rising more quickly in the united states than most people would prefer this is happening in part because the u s current account deficit and the country s high level of income inequality distort the structure and amount of american savings any americans are worried about the seemingly inexorable rise in u s debt whether government debt household debt or business debt they are right to be concerned rapidly rising debt is a problem not just in the united states but in many other countries too including china parts of europe and most of the developing world in today s environment it seems reasonable levels of economic growth cannot be achieved unless boosted by even faster growth in debt with so much debt in the world and with debt levels rising so quickly people tend to think that economists have studied this issue deeply and fully understand it but there continues to be a great deal of confusion about debt and about whether and why excessive debt levels can harm growth prospects to try to address these issues this blog post is divided into two parts the first part discusses debt and some of the conditions under which it affects the prospects for economic growth the second part argues that at least two of the reasons that debt has been rising inexorably in the united states for several years are the country s rising income inequality and its persistent trade deficit surprising as it may seem at first glance these two conditions operate the same way they distort the level and structure of american savings as long as income inequality remains high and the united states runs large deficits the resulting savings distortions will continue to mean that u s debt levels have to rise to prevent the economy from slowing and unemployment from rising why debt matters what are productive and nonproductive debt to begin with broadly speaking debt can be divided into two types self liquidating debt is used to fund investment projects that increase economic productivity enough after including all associated positive and negative externalities to service the debt fully in such cases an increase in debt is used to create an equal or greater increase in assets while this usually leaves the overall economy better off there could still be an argument about whether it is best to fund a particular project with debt versus equity about the best or least risky way of structuring the borrowing and about how the debt and its subsequent repayment affects income distribution all other debt funds household consumption nonproductive government activities such as military spending welfare programs and other kinds of consumption on behalf of households and nonproductive investment by either the government or businesses in some cases this debt can have a positive impact on economic welfare such as when debt is used to smooth out consumption over a person s life cycle in other cases it can be positive or negative for economic well being or for overall economic growth depending on how it affects the way income is distributed indeed this is one of its least understood but most important functions self liquidating debt adds to the total debt in the economy but rather than heighten the economy s debt burden it usually reduces the burden by increasing the wealth or productive capacity created by the project by more than the cost of the project the most common form this debt takes is business investment or government investment in infrastructure i say that this type of debt usually reduces a country s debt burden rather than saying it always does because this may not be the case if the debt is badly structured if for instance debt servicing costs are severely mismatched relative to a project s net increase in production such a project can raise uncertainty in ways that adversely affect the rest of the economy but except in cases of very badly structured highly inverted debt self liquidating debt is ultimately sustainable because it allows economic actors to service the rise in debt by more than the associated debt servicing costs in principle this means that the debt can be repaid fully out of the additional value created leaving everyone better off in the aggregate that said it is possible in some instances that certain sectors of the economy would benefit disproportionately and other sectors would be worse off with the winners exceeding the losers debt that is not self liquidating increases the total debt in the economy and because it doesn t improve debt servicing capacity usually adds to the economy s debt burden again i say usually rather than always because in some cases this second kind of debt leaves the economy s debt burden no worse off if the debt is used for consumption smoothing for instance in other cases such debt can even reduce the debt burden if the debt redistributes wealth in ways that increase the economy s wealth producing capacity 1 debt that isn t self liquidating is necessarily serviced only through implicit or explicit transfers from one economic sector to another in such cases the borrower can service the debt by appropriating income from other projects including taxes if the borrower is the government if the borrower defaults on the other hand the debt servicing cost is transferred to the creditors there are other ways that governments in particular can service such debt by effectively transferring the cost the debt can be eroded by inflation in which case the debt servicing cost is effectively forced onto those who are long monetary assets mainly households that save in the form of bonds bank deposits and other interest sensitive assets if wages are forced down to make it easier for businesses or governments to service their debts the debt servicing cost is forced onto workers if government debt is serviced by expropriation the debt servicing cost is forced onto the rich or onto foreigners one way or another in other words this kind of debt is serviced by explicitly assigning or implicitly allocating the costs by way of a transfer of wealth is excessive debt bad for the economy unfortunately few economists seem able to explain coherently why a heavy debt burden can be harmful to the economy this statement may seem surprising but ask any economist why an economy would suffer from having too much debt and he or she almost always responds that too much debt is a problem because it might cause a debt crisis or undermine confidence in the economy not only that but how much debt is considered too much seems to be an even harder questions to answer 2 but this is clearly a circular argument excessive debt wouldn t cause a debt crisis unless it undermined economic growth for some other reason saying that too much debt is harmful for an economy because it might cause a crisis is at best a kind of truism as intelligible as saying that too much debt is harmful for an economy because it might be harmful for the economy what is more this sentiment isn t even correct as a truism admittedly countries with too much debt can certainly suffer debt crises and these events are unquestionably harmful but as british economist john stuart mill explained in an 1867 paper for the manchester statistical society panics do not destroy capital they merely reveal the extent to which it has been previously destroyed by its betrayal into hopelessly unproductive works while a crisis can magnify an existing problem the point mills makes is that a crisis mostly recognizes the harm that has already been done yet paradoxically too much debt doesn t always lead to a crisis historical precedents clearly demonstrate that what sets off a debt crisis is not excessive debt but rather severe balance sheet mismatches for that reason countries with too much debt don t suffer debt crises if they can successfully manage these balance sheet mismatches through a forced restructuring of liabilities china s balance sheets for example may seem horribly mismatched on paper but i have long argued that china is unlikely to suffer a debt crisis even though chinese debt has been excessively high for years and has been rising rapidly as long as the country s banking system is largely closed and its regulators continue to be powerful and highly credible with a closed banking system and powerful regulators beijing can restructure liabilities at will contrary to conventional wisdom however even if a country can avoid a crisis this doesn t mean that it will manage to avoid paying the costs of having too much debt in fact the cost may be worse excessively indebted countries that do not suffer debt crises seem inevitably to end up suffering from lost decades of economic stagnation these periods in the medium to long term have much more harmful economic effects than debt crises do although such stagnation can be much less politically harmful and sometimes less socially harmful debt crises in other words are simply one way that excessive debt can be resolved while they are usually more costly in political and social terms they tend to be less costly in economic terms what are the actual costs of excessive debt so why is excessive debt a bad thing i am addressing this topic in a future book to put it briefly there are at least five reasons why too much debt eventually causes economic growth to drop sharply through either a debt crisis or lost decades of economic stagnation first an increase in debt that does not generate additional debt servicing capacity isn t sustainable however while such debt does not generate real wealth creation or productive capacity or debt servicing capacity which ultimately amount to the same thing it does generate economic activity and the illusion of wealth creation because there are limits to a country s debt capacity once the economy has reached those limits debt creation and the associated economic activity both must decline to the degree that a country relies on an accelerating debt burden to generate economic activity and gdp growth in other words once it reaches debt capacity limits and credit creation slows so does the country s gdp growth and economic activity second and more importantly an excessively indebted economy creates uncertainty about how debt servicing costs are to be allocated in the future as a consequence all economic agents must change their behavior in ways that undermine economic activity and increase balance sheet fragility see endnote 2 this process which is analogous to financial distress costs in corporate finance theory is heavily self reinforcing some countries china is probably the leading example have a high debt burden that is the result of the systematic misallocation of investment into nonproductive projects in these countries it is rare for these investment misallocations or the associated debt to be correctly written down if such a country did correctly write down bad debt it would not be able to report the high gdp growth numbers that it typically does as a result there is a systematic overstatement of gdp growth and of reported assets wealth is overstated by the failure to write down bad debt once debt can no longer rise quickly enough to roll over existing bad debt the debt is directly or indirectly amortized and the overstatement of wealth is explicitly assigned or implicitly allocated to a specific economic sector this causes the growth of gdp and economic activity to understate the real growth in wealth creation by the same amount by which it was previously overstated insofar as the excess debt is owed to foreigners its servicing costs represent a real transfer of resources outside the economy to the extent that the excess debt is domestic its servicing costs usually represent a real transfer of resources from economic sectors that are more likely to use these resources for consumption or investment to sectors that are much less likely to use these resources for consumption or investment in such cases the intra country transfer of resources represented by debt servicing will reduce aggregate demand in the economy and consequently slow economic activity does debt affect demand except for economies in which all resources including labor and capital are fully utilized and for economies that have no slack unutilized resources and labor increases in debt can boost current domestic demand although not always sustainably when households borrow for example they usually do so either to buy homes or to increase consumption i am not sure how much of home buying in the united states spurs new construction and how much represents sales of existing homes but in the latter case the borrowing creates no new demand for the economy except to the extent that the seller uses the proceeds of a home sale to increase consumption of course insofar as borrowing for consumption directly increases aggregate demand by increasing consumption today the repayment of such borrowing reduces consumption tomorrow this is another area that seems to confuse economists enormously standard economic theory states that borrowing simply transfers spending from the lender to the borrower and that repaying debt reverses these transfers in such instances no new demand is created by borrowing nor is it extinguished by repaying but this is only true for an economy that is fully utilizing its labor capital and other resources and in which investment is constrained by high costs of capital in such cases borrowers must bid up the cost of capital to gain access to savings and in so doing they prevent someone else from employing these resources this is when borrowing has no net impact on total demand it simply transfers spending from one part of the economy to another and the only thing that matters for the health of the economy is how efficient any particular use of savings might be and what impact that use has on long term growth but for an economy with substantial slack whose investors are reluctant to engage in new investment because of insufficient demand borrowing does create additional demand while future repayment usually reverses this added demand among the three types of borrowing household government and business household borrowing is not self liquidating and directly increases the country s debt burden this is because aggregate debt rises with no increase in the country s debt servicing capacity or productive capacity except to the extent that the borrowing encourages businesses to invest in manufacturing capacity increases in government debt similarly do not result in equivalent increases in debt servicing or productive capacity except insofar as government borrowing is used to fund investment in productive infrastructure if used to fund consumption household transfers military spending and so on government debt can boost current domestic demand without boosting debt servicing capacity or productive capacity an increase in domestic demand that must later be reversed 3 increases in business debt on the other hand do usually fund productive investment so these increases usually boost debt servicing or productive capacity when businesses borrow capital however for stock buybacks to pay down other debt to cover losses or for nonproductive investment projects usually subsidized by governments this debt functions just like household borrowing for consumption in the sense that it is not self liquidating how american savings are distorted two reasons for rising u s debt i have no way of calculating the extent to which recent increases in u s debt have funded productive or nonproductive activity but a substantial portion of increases in american debt over the past several years is probably almost certainly unsustainable and not self liquidating this is because rising debt is needed to keep growth in economic activity high enough to prevent a rise in unemployment economists don t generally distinguish between growth in economic activity which is mostly what gdp measures and growth in economic wealth or in wealth producing capacity they tend simply to equate the two i discuss this issue in a january 2019 blog post while the two may be equal over the long run however over shorter periods they are not necessarily equal given that the former can exceed the latter especially as a consequence of an unsustainable increase in debt i will not pretend to offer a complete analysis of debt in the u s economy here but there are at least two reasons that the united states has no choice but to encourage an increase in debt to prevent a rise in unemployment the first reason is the u s role in the global balance of payments system and the second one is high levels of u s income inequality although these two factors seem like two different things they work in the same way and for the same reasons why trade deficits actually matter i have explained many times before including here and here that the united states runs trade deficits mainly because the rest of the world exports its excess savings there standard trade theory suggests that under normal conditions the united states should run persistent trade surpluses as i will explain in my next blog post but because of distortions in income distribution in the rest of the world developed economies suffer from excess savings and insufficient demand the way this works is straightforward although it may seem counterintuitive at first there are two ways to boost international competitiveness which in a highly globalized world can lead automatically to higher growth the high road is to boost domestic productivity typically by investing in needed infrastructure education and technology the low road is to reduce relative wages something that can be done directly or indirectly the direct approach is to lower wages or wage growth as for example germany did during and after the hartz reforms of 2003 2005 an indirect way of achieving the same effect is for a country to hold down the value of its currency by doing things like imposing explicit or hidden tariffs subsidizing production factors at the expense of households or increasing household transfers to other sectors of the economy the low road is of course easier to embark on quickly and it effectively entails reducing the household share of what a country produces directly or indirectly in other words households receive less total compensation for producing a given amount the problem with this low road approach is that it reduces total demand as households receive a lower share of gdp they consume a lower share unless there is a commensurate rise in investment the result is that a country is less likely to be able to absorb everything it produces in a closed economy or one in which international trade and capital flows are limited by high frictional costs a country that produces more than it can absorb domestically must allow unwanted inventory to pile up until once debt limits are reached it must close down production facilities and fire workers in a highly globalized world however where the frictional costs of international trade and capital flows are extremely low or even nonexistent it is much easier for such a country to export both the excess production and the excess savings this is the problem policies that increase international competitiveness by lowering the household share of gdp reduce total demand within such countries but these policies also allow these countries to gain a larger share of foreign demand this is the tradeoff that makes this arrangement work for the surplus country while domestic demand shrinks the surplus country more than makes up for it by increasing its share of what is left at the expense of its trade partners whether this state of affairs benefits or harms the global economy depends primarily on where the excess savings are exported if they are exported to a developing country whose domestic investment needs are constrained by insufficient domestic savings they can cause a boost in productive investment that increases the recipient country s domestic demand in such cases the net effect on the world is usually positive if the increase in investment in the recipient country is greater than the reduction in consumption in the exporting country the world is better off although there may still be legitimate disputes about distribution effects but if the excess savings are exported to an advanced economy whose domestic investment needs are not constrained by an inability to access domestic savings these savings do not result in an increase in investment so the world is left with lower demand as i will explain below see where might this argument be wrong when excess savings flow into the united states these savings do not cause investment to rise this is a classic case of beggar thy neighbor policies in which one country benefits at the greater expense of its trade partners much of the world s excess savings flow to rich countries where these funds are not needed rather than to developing countries that can use them productively it is typically the countries with the most open most flexible and best governed financial markets that end up on the receiving end mainly the so called anglo saxon economies and especially the united states the united states runs capital account surpluses in other words not because it is capital short but because the world has excess savings and the united states is the leading safe haven into which to hoard these savings some observers might object to this interpretation after all they might say doesn t the united states have a low savings rate well below its investment rate and doesn t that prove that the united states needs foreign savings we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us not necessarily while this was the case in the nineteenth century when the united states imported capital because it lacked sufficient domestic savings to fund its investment needs it is no longer true in the twenty first century rather than assuming as most economists still do that the united states imports foreign savings because u s savings are too low it is vital to recognize that u s savings are low because the united states imports foreign savings this is because a country with a capital account surplus must by definition run a current account deficit and because investment in that country must also by definition exceed savings most economists see this tautology and mistakenly assume an automatic direction of causality in which foreign capital inflows drive u s investment above the level of u s savings the main reason for this assumption it turns out is because if inflows don t drive up investment they must drive down savings and people have a difficult time understanding how foreign capital inflows can drive down savings but as i will show later see what drives down savings there is nothing mysterious or unlikely about this process why income inequality matters it may seem surprising at first that income inequality has the same economic impact as forced imports of foreign capital by itself income inequality tends to force up the savings rate simply because rich households save more than ordinary or poor households put differently if 100 is transferred from an ordinary american household which consumes perhaps 80 percent of its income and saves 20 percent to a rich household which consumes around 15 percent of its income and saves 85 percent the initial impact of the transfer is to reduce consumption by 65 and increase desired savings by the same amount but that is not the end of the story in any economic system savings can only rise if investment rises if the united states cannot invest the additional savings for reasons which i will discuss below again see where might this argument be wrong if rising income inequality causes u s savings in one part of the economy the rich household that benefitted from the increase in savings to rise this must also cause savings in some other part of the economy to decline again the point is fairly simple total savings cannot rise unless these savings are invested if savings in one part of the economy rise because of a transfer of wealth from poorer households to richer households and if this does not cause investment to rise this very transfer must then repress savings in another part of the economy notice how similar this is to the way the trade deficit works rising savings in one part of the world are exported to the united states and cause savings in the united states to decline in either case if investment doesn t rise savings cannot rise so an increase in savings in one sector or country must cause a reduction of savings in another what drives down savings there are many ways that the import of foreign savings or the additional savings of the rich can drive down savings in the overall economy net capital inflows may strengthen the dollar to a level far higher than it would otherwise be currency appreciation by increasing the value of household income at the expense of the tradable goods sector forces down a country s savings rate in effect increasing the household share of gdp and with it usually the consumption share u s unemployment may be higher than it otherwise would be because of cheap foreign imports that help create the u s current account deficit or because income inequality drives down consumer demand and with it perhaps investment unemployed workers have a negative savings rate as they consume out of their savings so rising unemployment would drive down the savings rate if that happens unemployment would require more government borrowing to fund larger fiscal transfers most of which would cause consumption to rise and savings to decline to reduce unemployment the u s federal reserve might expand credit and the money supply encouraging additional borrowing the capital inflows or looser monetary policy may inflate the prices of real estate stocks and other american assets even setting off asset bubbles a recurring response historically speaking to substantial capital inflows higher asset prices can make americans feel richer creating a wealth effect that drives up consumption the consequent boost in real estate prices could set off additional real estate development some of which might be economically justified and some that might not be technically this would not be a reduction in savings but rather an increase in investment but it would have the same net impact on the capital account to the extent that some real estate development turns out to be economically unjustified in future periods it may be written down with the losses representing a reduction in the total stock of savings u s banks and shadow banks flush with liquidity and needing to create loans may lower lending standards and give loans to households that would otherwise be perceived as too risky as long as there is a normal distribution of risk taking and optimism among american households and this is the case in every country whenever banks lower their consumer lending standards there are households who take out loans and spend the proceeds on additional consumption driving down savings credit card companies and consumer finance companies with abundant liquidity may make consumer credit more widely available and at cheaper rates than they otherwise would notice that these numerous methods of driving down the savings rate can be summarized as one of two either unemployment rises or debt rises because washington is likely to respond to a rise in unemployment by increasing the fiscal deficit or loosening credit conditions in the end the result of rising income inequality and trade deficits is almost always that debt rises faster than it otherwise would that shouldn t be surprising another way of looking at it is that both trade deficits and high income inequality reduce domestic demand so returning the economy to its expected growth rate requires a new source of demand and this new source is almost always generated by debt by the way this explains in part why economists are generally unable to find a correlation between the trade deficit and unemployment or between income inequality and unemployment rather than cause unemployment to rise these conditions can simply force an increase in debt where might this argument be wrong this is a purely logical argument so it would be wrong only if any of the underlying assumptions are wrong the main such assumption is whether investment is not constrained by savings the standard argument is that investment is always constrained by savings and that forcing up savings is positive for investment because even in economies with abundant savings and low interest rates it lowers the cost of funding however marginally if businesses can borrow at a lower rate than before the argument goes there always will be some productive investment opportunity that only becomes profitable at this new lower borrowing cost this outcome must lead to more investment which should lead to more growth over the long run this is the basic argument behind supply side economics and the implicit justification for president donald trump s recent tax cuts most economists agree that investment levels in the united states are low probably too low and that the united states would grow faster over the long term if businesses could be encouraged to invest more given that one of the most efficient ways to boost investment is presumably to make more capital available to businesses at lower costs tax cuts for the rich would theoretically benefit the rest of the country eventually as the additional wealth generated by higher investment trickled down can policies that result in greater income inequality nonetheless leave a country better off it turns out that the answer again depends on the availability of savings in the economy in a capital scare environment like a typical developing economy policies that force up the domestic savings rate can result in a substantial one for one increase in domestic investment for every unit reduction in consumption in such a case total demand is unchanged since lower consumption is matched by higher investment the economy grows as quickly as ever in the short run while getting wealthier in the long run however this isn t necessarily the case in a capital rich environment like most advanced economies today in recent years the financial system has been awash with liquidity interest rates have been at all time lows and u s corporations have been sitting on hoards of cash that they seem unable to put to productive use in such cases most economists would agree that every unit reduction in consumption is likely to be matched by a smaller increase in investment so in the short run total demand would decline this means that supply side policies can reduce short term growth in the united states because these policies cause a drop in total demand assuming that lower consumption is only partially matched by higher investment nonetheless as long as at least part of the reduction in consumption is matched by an increase in productive investment it is still possible to argue that the country would be better off in the long run because investment increases productive capacity in such cases the rich benefit immediately from tax cuts for the rich while the rest of society benefits eventually but counterintuitively for most economists it might be a mistake to assume that insofar as supply side policies increase the availability of capital and lower its cost conditions that force up the desired savings rate must always lead to additional investment there are conditions under which such policies may actually lead to less investment and this outcome is especially likely today in most advanced economies all it requires is that broadly speaking all or most investment falls into one of two categories the first category consists of projects whose value is not sensitive to marginal changes in demand perhaps because they bring about very evident and significant increases in productivity or because the economy suffers from significant underinvestment the second category consists of projects whose value ultimately varies as a function of changes in demand in the former case these projects often in infrastructure are typically and for obvious reasons more likely to be found in developing countries in which capital is scarce than in today s advanced economies in the early 1980s for example china reportedly had only a handful of commercial airports a country as big as china urgently needed far more than it had so it could be argued that whether china was expected to grow at 10 percent annually 5 percent or even zero percent it nonetheless needed additional airport capacity in that case the need to invest is not sensitive to the expected growth in demand at some point however once china has filled the obvious airport gap whether or not the country needs to build more airports depends on its growth prospects a rapidly growing china will need more additional airport capacity than a slow growing china in which case investment in airports would fall into the second category which consists of projects whose profitability is sensitive to demand conditions by dividing investment into these two categories it becomes clear that policies that aim to force up desired savings and constrain consumption can have two contradictory effects on total investment forcing up savings increases investments that aren t sensitive to marginal changes in demand by making more capital available at lower costs constraining consumption however reduces investments that are sensitive to marginal changes in demand by lowering the demand that drives the profitability of such investments what matters is simple arithmetic the relative size of these two categories in economies where only some investment is sensitive to demand fluctuations and most investment isn t most developing economies conditions like income inequality that boost the savings rate can lift total investment and by extension long term growth but in economies where the profitability of most investments is a function of changes in demand income inequality can result in less total desired investment rather than more greater capital availability at lower interest rates may cause certain additional marginal investments to be made but the resulting increase in investment can easily be overwhelmed by a reduction in investment set off by slower consumption growth put differently if u s companies are reluctant to invest not because the cost of capital is high but rather because expected profitability is low they are unlikely to respond to the trade off between cheaper capital and lower demand by investing more with less consumption businesses that manufacture consumer goods are more likely to close down factories or postpone investment plans the claim that higher desired savings can lead to less investment may at first sound outlandish and marriner eccles 1890 1977 a former chairman of the federal reserve board struggled to make just this point in the 1930s this seems to be what happened in germany after the hartz reforms as well as income was transferred from german workers to german businesses in the form of soaring profits income inequality in germany worsened as expected german savings rose but unexpectedly investment actually declined perhaps in partial response to the increase in savings the same seems to have happened in the united states following last year s 1 5 trillion tax cut by the trump administration as an articlethis week in reuters reminds us the white house had predicted that the massive fiscal stimulus package marked by the reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent would boost business spending and job growth the tax cuts came into effect in january 2018 but rather than cause an increase in business investment the tax cuts seem to have had no impact or even a slightly negative one which shouldn t come as a surprise if american businesses already had access to as much capital as they needed the national association of business economics nabe quarterly business conditions poll published on monday found that while some companies reported accelerating investments because of lower corporate taxes 84 percent of respondents said they had not changed plans that compares to 81 percent in the previous survey published in october the nabe survey also suggested a further slowdown in business spending after moderating sharply in the third quarter of 2018 the survey s measure of capital spending fell in january to its lowest level since july 2017 expectations for capital spending for the next three months also weakened what can be done given these facts the expected effects of income inequality and capital account surpluses and the accompanying trade deficits on the u s economy all depend almost exclusively on what people assume about investment if policies or conditions that increase savings cause u s investment to rise then income inequality and capital account surpluses trade deficits can be positive for american growth if not these effects will necessarily either increase u s unemployment or more likely u s debt so assuming that income inequality and capital account surpluses trade deficits are not positive for american growth what can the united states do to mitigate these effects limit foreign capital inflows the united states must reduce its trade deficit with the world but not by addressing the trade deficit directly through import tariffs or quotas remember that because the u s trade deficit is the automatic consequence of the u s capital account surplus as long as the country is forced to import foreign capital it will run a trade deficit meaning that debt must rise if the country is to avoid a rise in unemployment import tariffs or quotas will only reduce the u s trade deficit to the extent that they reduce foreign capital inflows and it is not at all clear that they will do so in fact they are at least as likely to increase inflows instead the united states must address foreign capital inflows directly perhaps by taxing them reverse income inequality there are many ways in which the united states can reverse income inequality washington could make the income tax code more progressive for example strengthen the country s social safety net raise minimum wages or increase infrastructure spending 4 force up productive investment domestically if the us decides that it cannot choose but to tolerate high levels of income inequality and run large capital account surpluses it can at least decide to match the resulting increase in savings availability with higher investment especially by boosting funding for infrastructure in this way keeping unemployment from rising doesn t require that debt rise otherwise debt must continue to rise to prevent savings to adjust in the form of high unemployment aside from this blog i write a monthly newsletter that covers some of the same topics those who are interested in receiving the newsletter should write to me at chinfinpettis yahoo com stating affiliation notes 1 because this may seem surprising to many it is probably worth specifying how the wealth redistribution impact of debt can leave an economy better off even when the debt is nonproductive first debt leaves an economy better off in cases in which productive investment is constrained by low savings if it takes purchasing power from sectors of the economy that save a very low share of their income or from sectors that save in nonproductive ways by hoarding gold foreign currency or other assets and gives that purchasing power to sectors that save a high share of their income in productive ways second debt leaves an economy better off in cases in which demand is low and savings excessive if it redistributes wealth from sectors of the economy that save a high share of their income to sectors that consume a high share of their income of course in these cases the debt itself matters only because of its role in income redistribution which i address in the next paragraph and which in principle can be managed more efficiently in other ways even if these other ways are sometimes politically harder to implement 2 as i will explain more in a future book a country has excessive debt when there is enough uncertainty about how future debt servicing costs will be allocated to cause economic agents to change their behavior in ways that adversely affect the economy in such a scenario the rich would take money out of the country for example while business owners would disinvest and investors would speculate on short term investments meanwhile workers would organize and become more militant the middle class would save by hoarding nonproductive assets like gold collectibles or foreign currency and policymakers would shorten their time horizons 3 some economists argue that government debt need not ever be repaid and that it can simply be monetized or inflated away but of course that doesn t mean that the debt isn t repaid it simply means that the repayment takes the form of a hidden tax on monetary savings rather than an explicit tax 4 throughout history income inequality also has been reversed in ways that destroy wealth rather than redistribute it such as war revolution or massive debt defaults either at home or abroad historically very high levels of income inequality in the united states and elsewhere in the world have always eventually been partly reversed either in positive ways or negative ways rather than discuss whether or not reversing income inequality is desirable perhaps it would be better to recognize that it will almost certainly happen eventually anyway it is therefore more important to discuss how it should be done
by paddington masamha when zimbabwe adopted the multi currency system any currency from the basket of currencies was accepted as legal tender within the financial system when the liquidity crisis supervened the relevant ministries introduced bond coins and later on bond notes on a 1 1 peg the reserve bank of zimbabwe r b z s 4 december 2014 press release posited that bond coins were introduced to buttress the multiple currency system through the provision of change especially for the us notes which have a smallest denomination in circulation in zimbabwe of us 1 through addressing the divisibility and store of value features of money the r b z made a public guarantee that the bond coins would therefore be a good store of value as it later emerged the bond coin introduction was not triggered by the divisibility concern but obviously the government unrestrained borrowing the zimbabwean currency crisis continued to take a nose dive which later prompted the introduction of 2 00 and 5 00 bond notes with effect from 28 november 2016 over and above the bond coins which were already in circulation this time however they were mainly introduced to fund export incentives of up to 5 which will be paid to exporters of goods and services and diaspora remittances as stated in the press release the 26 november 2016 rbz press release continued to publicly upheld the 1 1 parity peg members of the general public were given the assurance that no new accounts will be opened as the bond notes would be deposited into existing us dollar accounts the bond note was acceptable as legally permissible to settle any debt in any currency at least within the zimbabwean borders at some point some banks names withheld and a mobile money company had a facility where zimbabweans could use their international cards to withdraw money outside the country particularly the rand and even make foreign payments following the 1 october 2018 historic announcement by the reserve bank of zimbabwe of the separation of nostro accounts and the rtgs accounts surprisingly however maintaining the public rhetoric of 1 1 parity the bond note has without a doubt become a volatile currency the public pronouncements by fiscal authorities that zimra now demands payment of taxes in foreign currency currency of trade further compounded the already worse off scenario in january 2019 the highest office in the land announced the fuel price increases which had price disparity of us dollar fuel price for foreigners and bond note rtgs transfer and mobile money denominated fuel price shockingly however regardless of having these apparent price differences the president reiterated that the 1 1 parity was still maintained a trace of the government s 2018 and 2019 episodic political fiscal and monetary blunders only leads to one conclusion that the economy is now a financial circus in the midst of a multi currency regime the government is de facto refusing its own currency and demanding foreign currency recently in december 2018 newspaper headlines were awash with more evidence that zimra is now demanding the payment of carbon tax in foreign currency as 2019 began all foreign registered vehicles now pay temporary import permits tips in foreign currency mostly rands and us dollars one would not be wrong to make a prediction that government will sooner rather than later start demanding the payment of gate passes and road access fees in foreign currency for all foreign registered vehicles government organizations who are also likely going to soon demand foreign currency from foreign registered vehicles include zinara for tollgate fees and ema for any license fees and or penalties levied by the respective organizations not forgetting the mof who gave a directive that all foreign registered trucks should pay for fuel in foreign currency what boggles the mind is why should a government which is refusing to accept its own currency behave in this manner what market signals are they revealing to the much responsive zimbabwean market the zimbabwean taxman is re dollarising the economy it is without a doubt that the r b z s objective of preserving the bond note value is a failed strategy or a doomed monetary policy direction as usual the zimbabwean market is on its own slowly dollarizing from the evidence on the ground ceos and cfos of most private institutions are slowly re pricing their services commodities or products in such a manner that willing buyers are indirectly compelled to pay in foreign currency than through bond notes for instance if today one considers the pricing system within the fast foods industry or fmcgs products now have two prices that is a bond note rtgs mobile money price and a us dollar price though this new pricing strategy was adopted as if it s a promotional tactic towards the 2018 festive season the open message by these private organisations is that the us dollar is our pricing currency a similar observation can be made within the insurance industry property valuations for insurance policies now have us dollar and bond note valuation as such any sensible individual or corporate intending to insure their valuable assets are better off paying us dollar premiums obviously with the expectation of receiving us dollars whenever any risk occurs in most private institutions particularly pharmacies the bond note price is usually so outrageous to an extent that a willing buyer would rather go to a trusted obviously fully knowing the consequences of the 10 year jail term money changer buy foreign currency from the black market come back to the same shop and purchase the prescribed drugs simply private sectors firms have set the bond note prices at a range where a rational consumer would be forced to come back and buy the product using foreign currency unfortunately how where and when the consumers access the foreign currency is not the entrepreneur s concern but the pricing system is forcing the economy to re dollarise yes it is permissible to insinuate that in october 2018 the market bubbled i e over reacted or experienced exaggerated market reactions however this writer is concerned with certain fundamental issues and thus tables the following questions what is the market signaling can the r b z strengthen the value of the bond note through the m p s how sustainable if the 1 1 parity condition with all the full knowledge of gresham s law the monetary authorities adamantly introduced the bad money bond notes gresham s law states that whenever any two monetary units in this case bond notes and us dollar are given the same face value 1 1 parity condition the obvious result would be that the overvalued bad money bond note will be used whilst the undervalued good money us dollars vanishes from the monetary system the zimbabwean experience is evidence enough that gresham s law is a real world economic theory which monetary authorities should not discredit the monetary authorities should have respected gresham s 15th century observation that good and bad coin cannot circulate together gresham s conclusions were mainly driven by the works of aristophanes 405bc poetry work titled the frogs the zimbabwean leadership s failure to learn from ancient economic and political history has brought zimbabwe to a stage of fighting the bond note plague during the ancient days of aristophanes and gresham the easily observable effect of bad money chasing good money was more significant between kingdoms from one kingdom to another therefore the usually common injustice was the value destruction and deprivation of better purchasing power of people within a certain kingdom to another looked at from the lens of that ancient thinking the rulers of the zimbabwean kingdom established a multi currency regime within its own kingdom faced with the liquidity crisis the relevant authorities introduced the bond note the observable consequence is the flight of good money us dollars south african rands botswana pula etc from the official markets landing in the hands of the greedy market traders and cash barons additionally there has been a significant flight of good money abroad south africa china and united states of america as the rulers of the kingdom failed to maintain the value of the bond thus even looked at in ancient times the policies of the kingdom rulers are rendered defective vigorously the current market signal points towards the inevitable direction that the assumed bond note and united states dollar usd 1 1 parity condition is futile and will soon collapse for the surrogate bond note to maintain the assumed parity conditions the monetary authorities need to have foreign currency reserves that can be used for market interventions so as to maintain the value of the bond note since its introduction the bond note has failed to maintain the parity conditions the re emergence of a boisterous parallel market pays homage to the bond note introduction one of the major issues which contributed to the public outcry and the call for the removal of toxic politics was the parallel market of mainly the usd dollar and the bond note in the year 2017 besides the politically destabilizing elements within zanu pf factions economic problems particularly the parallel market pushed the masses into the streets obviously with the blessing or backing of the army soon after the military takeover and the official resignation of the former president the parallel market rates drastically reduced from the estimated highest of 250 to average rates ranging from 30 50 of usd rtgs parallel market trading rates during the 2018 election campaign period black market rates started to gain momentum but albeit on a moderate scale the period in between the election date and constitutional court election contestations also had marginal increases the rates largely oscillated depending on the trending news on who was likely fancied to be the future president soon after the historic constitutional court ruling the parallel market rates peaked an upward trend a final blow to the already brewing problem was the 1 october 2018 mps announcement the parallel market rates ran amok and traders were paying rates as high as 350 400 for every 100 00 us dollar note basing on these signals one can essentially notice that the bond note has lost its market value and acceptability as a surrogate currency in the month of november and december 2018 parallel market rates kind of stabilized within the ranges of 280 00 to 320 00 bond notes rtgs transfer and mobile money for every 100 00 us dollar the recent fuel price increase however is expected to change the black market status quo empirical evidence on the ground however openly demonstrates that the monetary authorities do not have any foreign currency reserves and are actually grappling to meet the working capital demands of most corporations the prime case of riozim and delta is a clear testimony within the multi currency set up corporations whose prime business is that of exporting under normal circumstances should be receiving their proceeds in us dollars however since the adoption of the central bank s foreign currency allocation initiative priority has largely been skewed towards the fuel and oil industry the zimbabwean foreign currency drought and failure to allocate the few available resources to the exporters who are the foreign currency generators is an indication of central bank failure to maintain and let alone sustain the assumed parity condition the much talked about and very secretive afreximbank loan facility might be a window dressing scheme if proven to be true such financial chicanery at national level is not only intolerable but inhuman it is gradually noticeable that the assumed strength of the bond note is merely based on a verbal commitment without any supporting financial schemes which will prove that the parity conditions will be maintained and sustained going forward the moral suasion strategy being adopted by monetary authorities needs a backup of financing schemes which support the assumed parity condition the newly publicized austerity for prosperity in my opinion is a disproportionate austerity measure fiscal authority s insatiable desire to tax the poor masses whilst financing the lavish spending of the political elite is an unfair governance scheme the failure by the fiscal authorities to arrest the main problem plaguing the economy of excessive government spending is a sure market signal that our government is yet to reform and likely going to repeat the yesteryear problems the cogent need to eradicate the oligarchy and kleptocracy in our governance system is an unquestionable stratagem as such all the three identified key leaders within the economy still have a long way to go if they tolerate any chance of reviving the zimbabwean economy the usual attempt by the governing authorities to use public statements such as wanton profiteering or economic saboteurs is at this stage an unacceptable position that the current leadership can take against private sector institutions the very act of sabotage or unfair governance practice is starting from the government institutions themselves as such any attempt by entrepreneurs to hedge against perceived and in most cases real currency losses should be viewed by the leadership as a rejection of unworkable monetary policy measures instead of adopting the blame game tactics the country s leadership should instead solve the currency crisis currently bedeviling our country in a nutshell the perpetuation of government policy inconsistencies corruption and political self aggrandizement will surely make the zimbabwean road to economic recovery an insurmountable task contrary to the proposed introduction of zimbabwe s own currency in the next 12 months in my opinion zimbabwe still needs a paradigm shift in its fiscal monetary and political governance system a new currency needs foreign currency reserves generating the much needed foreign currency to pay back our indebtedness stabilize the financial sector and later on finance a new currency introduction within such a short space of time can be economic hallucinations i will keep singing the same song of fiscal consolidation directed towards government portfolios demonetization of the bond note full dollarization in the interim period criminalizing the abuse of public offices reducing the size of the public sector and a variety of structural reforms zimbabwean economic problems are largely incubated from the political governance system the de contamination of the politically unhygienic impediments is undoubtedly an unquestionable bedrock for economic recovery paddington masamha is independent financial economic analyst you can reach him on email or twitter pmasamha
content sourced from the world gold council in his book the curse of cash leading economist ken rogoff suggests that excessive reliance on paper money is responsible for ills ranging from tax evasion to terrorism he also believes that monetary policy would be more effective in a largely cashless society cryptocurrencies are not an effective replacement for paper money he says but gold s role is likely to increase as cash fades from view first there were cheques then debit and credit cards then electronic transfers and most recently smartphone applications with each innovation cash has become less relevant at the turn of the century for example 35 of all legal transactions by value were conducted in cash in the united states today that figure has declined to 7 and it is expected to fall to around 2 in the next decade at the same time however the supply of paper money keeps rising as ken rogoff professor of economics and professor of public policy at harvard university explains cash is totally in decline but supply keeps going up it is almost all in large denomination notes and it is mainly used for tax evasion regulatory evasion and of course crime eventually these notes will be so little used in legal transactions that people won t be able to launder them anymore and then the central banks will just have to buy them back but i think the process should be accelerated he adds fair taxation is one of the principal reasons that rogoff cites in favour of a largely cashless society the us internal revenue service estimates that around 15 of all taxes owed are never collected cash intensive businesses account for about half of those uncollected revenues in europe the figures are much higher particularly in italy spain greece and germany and the problem is that this makes taxes higher for the rest of us he says fewer notes more taxes in the us alone the sums involved are substantial around us 500 billion bn at a federal level and a further us 200 300bn at local and state level according to rogoff the federal reserve makes around us 80bn from printing cash but if it could recoup even a portion of those unpaid taxes that would more than compensate for the loss of printing revenues and in a modern digital world central banks will have plenty of opportunities to make money as trusted parties clearing houses of last resort and such like rogoff suggests also if we kept smaller bills in the united states which account for 5 10 of total bills in circulation the fed would still be making up to us 8bn a year and the chances are that if we got rid of larger notes the number of smaller notes would rise a lot so central banks would continue as profit centres even if we became largely cashless he adds rogoff suggests too that if the only cash in circulation comprised small notes and coins central banks would be more able to introduce negative interest rates if and when appropriate because savers would not have much option but to keep most of their money in the bank this could have widespread economic implications monetary policy is an essential fine tuning tool fiscal policy is obviously critical too but it s highly political and it s always going to be that way quantitative easing is mostly smoke and mirrors so being able to introduce effective negative interest rates is very important at certain times and it would be much easier to do in a cashless economy he says there is an incredible disconnect between the fact that cash is disappearing in legal tax compliant transactions but exploding in terms of how much central banks are printing crypto sceptic some people believe that cryptocurrencies could and possibly should replace cash over time they are digital they refute the need for banks and they are virtually anonymous rogoff is highly sceptical however the idea that a few geniuses in silicon valley can create a world that governments can t touch is stupefyingly naïve and the idea that cryptocurrencies will replace the dollar is equally foolish he says rogoff suggests that if cryptocurrencies became more pervasive they could limit the effectiveness of fiscal policy and ultimately monetary policy but he does not believe this will ever happen cryptocurrencies are not a currency and they will be regulated we see regulation starting to happen in the uk and the us and it will keep ramping up the only reason it hasn t done so already is because cryptocurrencies just don t matter that much rogoff suggests that regulation is relatively straightforward governments simply need to limit the outlets where bitcoin and its ilk can be spent most people want to be able to use it in a store or take it into a bank so that s the way to limit its development he says this does not mean digital currencies have limited potential just that the systems behind them are likely to be rather different in future money supply will increasingly be digital in 20 years time pretty much all the central banks will be issuing digital retail currencies of a sort and you should be able to hold at least a digital savings account with your central bank cryptocurrency enthusiasts talk about permissionless and permissioned systems blockchain is permissionless because it does not rely on or need a central trusted authority i think the digital currencies of the future will operate via a permissioned system with a central party so they may be encrypted but they won t be anonymous rogoff predicts a history lesson even as cash becomes a dwindling resource and regulation changes the nature of cryptocurrencies rogoff believes that gold will retain and almost certainly increase its value if you look at the history of currency gold has a unique role and i don t think it s accidental some people say that if gold hadn t been selected as a currency thousands of years ago it would not have a role today i don t agree gold has a lot of useful properties and unique features so i don t think its status is in any way accidental it s a monetary asset and i think if you replayed history another way you would come out with gold again he says as we have less and less paper currency there will still be a need to store wealth to have privacy and to carry out transactions between parties who don t trust one another gold fills that role it s probably the best substitute for paper currency so it s hard to imagine its transaction value won t go up over time and there are all kinds of uses for gold in new technology that nobody even thought of years ago so overall it s hard to see gold s role diminishing he adds in addition to gold being a store of wealth rogoff takes the view that it is a valuable long term investment too both as a diversification and risk mitigation tool as the us economy becomes proportionately smaller and the dollarisation of the global economy becomes larger the equilibrium becomes increasingly fragile more gold needed he is particularly concerned about the amount of gold held by emerging market central banks suggesting they should increase their gold reserves by several percentage points emerging market central banks should hold fewer dollars and more gold as a way of diversifying their portfolio it s a simple question of diversification at the moment most emerging market central banks hold 1 2 of their reserves in gold with 70 80 in dollars and the rest in euros and other currencies i think a 5 allocation seems a natural position to take as part of an effective diversification policy although it could be higher after all the us share of the global economy is shrinking power is being centralised and we don t know what the future holds he says rogoff s rationale is clear the us dollar is increasingly dominant on the global stage yet us deficits are increasing and may well continue to do so the dollar is more widely used than ever a growing chunk of european corporate bonds are in dollars not in euros whenever asian countries issue debt abroad they do so in dollars reserves are in dollars and numerous goods are priced in dollars so the dollar is more dominant today than under bretton woods but that doesn t mean it s stable he says we already have trillion dollar deficits right now and they re manageable but if corporate local state and federal debt is allowed to grow there will come a point when the us gets stressed and if deficits have doubled or tripled by then inflation is bound to ensue our system is not built for high inflation so it would cause incredible financial turmoil and stress it may take decades but these things always tend to blow up at some point and as the us economy becomes proportionately smaller and the dollarisation of the global economy becomes larger the equilibrium becomes increasingly fragile he adds risk mitigation against this backdrop the rationale for holding gold becomes even clearer the point is treasury bills are not a riskless asset they may be for two to three years but not necessarily for the long term so if you want to build a 40 year plan you should have some diversification let s face it if you re a hedge fund manager and there is a 3 4 chance you will get wiped out and a 96 chance you will get very rich that s a bet worth taking if you re a country that s not such a smart bet rogoff explains as a hedge gold has enormous value so it makes sense for hnw individuals and even for some pension funds to hold a small percentage of their assets in gold he believes that institutional investors and wealthy individuals should also allocate a proportion of their portfolio to gold as a hedge gold has enormous value you never know what s going to happen and when something really bad happens gold is probably going to be worth a lot to you so it makes sense for high net worth hnw individuals and perhaps even for some pension funds to hold a small percentage of their assets in gold he says looking ahead rogoff suggests that gold is also likely to increase in value as its global role evolves i suspect gold s value will go up in real terms i think the trend towards digital currencies will strengthen the value of gold as emerging markets expand and trust the us less that will also strengthen the value of gold so as part of a larger portfolio allocation it seems very reasonable to me he concludes this article is a re post from here the original article also has other references our free

it is almost half a century since economist james tobin proposed a small transaction tax to stabilise volatile global capital flows tobin s proposal followed the breakdown of the bretton woods fixed exchange rate system in 1971 a tiny once off transaction tax wouldn t have much effect on medium and longer term flows but would impinge more heavily on short term flows tobin described it as throwing sand in the wheels of the speculative flows that had caused regular crises during the pre second world war gold standard period among the policy wonks in jakarta the focus is on how to make the portfolio flows more sticky so that funds stay put when global sentiment turns the idea fell on barren ground it was overwhelmed by the ascendency of the efficient markets doctrine financial markets were efficient in price discovery any transaction tax no matter how tiny would be distortionary and thus by definition a bad thing for more self interested reasons professional currency traders opposed such a tax wholeheartedly this doctrine was incorporated into the washington consensus with the international monetary fund becoming the defender of free capital flows many countries such as australia adapted over time to the post bretton woods world crises were common enough such as sterling in 1992 but were not attributable to volatile capital flows as such for emerging markets however flighty capital flows were a key vulnerability excessive inflows followed by sharp reversals were the central element in the 1997 asian financial crisis some academics retained doubts about efficient markets including some who vigorously promoted deregulated financial markets while in policy roles and the 2008 global financial crisis encouraged a re think over the past decade the imf has belatedly come to accept that capital flow management what formerly was dismissively termed capital controls was a legitimate policy response for those emerging economies which have from time to time been whip sawed by volatile short term capital flows indonesia illustrates the issues the response to the disaster of the 1997 crisis was to restrain growth and accumulate foreign exchange reserves even this was not enough to insulate indonesia from the 2013 taper tantrum 2018 saw another episode of capital flow reversal a year ago foreigners owned 42 of government bonds on issue when the market mood shifted six months ago what had been regarded as a sign of confidence in indonesia morphed to become a vulnerability with foreign bond holding falling below 37 around half of indonesia s capital inflow is in the form of portfolio investment the restless money constantly scouring the globe for the highest yield ready to react to the latest shift in risk on risk off mood indonesian policy makers have learned how to handle these swings in foreign sentiment they raise interest rates tighten fiscal policy and stand ready to intervene to defend the currency from extreme movements they did this last year and the drama was soon over but this policy has a cost investment is discouraged growth is trimmed important budget expenditures are delayed and financial markets are disrupted there ought to be a better way if this short term capital is so volatile is it worth having you can t fund longer term investment with money that is withdrawn on a market whim indonesia gains little benefit from these fickle funds as it has to maintain substantial foreign exchange reserves to cope with the incipient outflow the priority should be for stable flows rather than maximum inflow what might be done first best is an increased role for foreign direct investment not only more stable but more beneficial by international comparison indonesia s fdi inflow is small less than 2 of gdp in dollar terms fdi to indonesia is not much larger than to vietnam a much smaller economy in recent years indonesia has encouraged fdi shifting from 129th in the world bank s ranking on ease of doing business to 73rd but a post colonial nationalistic sentiment is never far below the surface when the going gets tough on the hustings so vigorously promoting foreign ownership is not going to win april s election among the policy wonks in jakarta the focus is on how to make the portfolio flows more sticky so that funds stay put when global sentiment turns hence the interest in some version of a tobin tax now that the washington consensus is properly seen as a general policy framework rather than a dogmatic doctrine such ideas can be discussed without derision from washington although financial markets are still very ready to pour cold water on any idea which constrains their flexibility and profits the lead up to a presidential election is no time for esoteric economic debates neither of the presidential candidates shows much interest in macroeconomics as well the precondition for such a tax is to find alternative inflows or reduce the current account deficit that has to be funded for the immediate future indonesia will have to accept the unpalatable deal which global financial markets offer we will lend you money in good times but we ll take it back whenever we have a fit of nerves but some variant on a tobin tax seems an idea whose time is coming for indonesia stephen grenville

a lack of transparency in economic decision making has led to a situation whereby pakistan may be in the throes of a debt trap temporary measures such as borrowing from friendly nations and pakistani expatriates to tide over the looming debt repayment and balance of payments shortfalls have become necessary to delay complying with the strictures of an international monetary fund imf lending programme however short term palliatives cannot change the fact that root and branch economic reforms are required and unless these are introduced at the earliest as the government backed economic advisory council is suggesting we ll undoubtedly soon have a feeling of déjà vu the china pakistan economic corridor cpec initiative is a signature achievement of the previous pml n government but when the head of the state bank of pakistan publicly lamented in 2015 that he was unaware of the financial implications of the cpec project something was seriously amiss if the person charged with formulating and implementing monetary policy is kept in the dark about expected inflows and outflows of foreign currency into the country that will affect the money supply then one can only speculate about the reasons for the opacity the need for speedy project execution and the complications of geopolitics may be why cpec was kept under wraps till the deal was finally inked but then one is only hoping that the government making such decisions has the expertise as well as the integrity to take all factors into account before embarking on such a massive financial commitment in hindsight this is an overly optimistic view of the skill level and intentions of those involved in the decision making in previous years pakistan has borrowed from international capital markets ostensibly to shore up its international currency reserves or due to deficits in its balance of payments the answer given by those in authority to the question of the need for foreign commercial borrowings when the country didn t necessarily have to resort to such a measure was of two types a because we can or b it will build the country s reputation for creditworthiness internationally thereby boosting prospective foreign investor confidence in the country pakistan s cumulative gross borrowings ie before any redemptions of foreign currencies from issuance of eurobonds and other capital market instruments amount to over 7 5 billion since 2003 the coupon rate ranges from a low of 5 635 percent for a sukuk with a 1 billion face value and 5 year tenor issued in 2017 to a relatively high 8 25 percent fixed rate coupon for a 10 year term eurobond with a 1 billion principal value issued in 2014 in responding to critics about the high coupon rates the country s financial managers regardless of the government in power always have a common refrain that this was the best that they could do since the coupon rate includes not only the real interest rate required by lenders as a reward for use of their funds but also the perceived risk of default because of pakistan s perennially weak macroeconomic fundamentals however this begs the question of whether tapping the international capital markets on commercial terms was in the country s interests given the prevailing economic situation at the time and the alternative of borrowing from lower cost bilateral and multilateral sources albeit with conditions attached the foreign currency borrowed through commercial sources helped to prop up the foreign currency value of the rupee anchored to some overvalued nominal exchange rate however the funds raised have at times also been invested in low yielding us government treasury bills meaning that the return received was far below the rates that the government had to pay to lenders this is a bizarre situation of a poor developing country paying out of pocket to borrow funds and instead of using them for productive purposes within its borders lending these to an advanced developed country with external debt there is the foreign currency risk arising from the likelihood of a depreciating rupee meaning that the burden of the foreign currency denominated debt is higher than initially assumed since it takes many more units of local currency to pay a certain amount of interest and principal in foreign currency than was expected at the time the loan was contracted sovereign borrowing for periods ranging from five to ten years also exposes pakistan to interest rate risk on variable rate issues as the coupon payment on some of the eurobonds outstanding are periodically reset in line with changes in a benchmark interest rate such as the london interbank offered rate libor or the 10 year us government bond the borrowing country is also subject to refinancing risk if the government does not have adequate foreign currency to make a bullet repayment of principal upon maturity of the bond issue as acknowledged in the recently published debt policy statement 2018 19 issued by the ministry of finance available on its website since late last month these risks have indeed materialised thus global interest rates have been on an upward path since the reversal starting late 2017 of the policy of quantitative easing qe by the us federal reserve bank and the announcement in december 2018 by the european central bank ecb that it has ended its qe programme the pakistan government s debt policy statement has however its own credibility problem since there is not a single mention of cpec in the entire text with higher interest rates in the us the dollar has been appreciating on international currency markets which means that pakistan is now faced with a double whammy of an appreciating dollar and higher interest rates putting enormous stress on its ability to service its external debt a pernicious aspect of relying on debt from commercial sources is that the sovereign borrower can use the funds in any which way and does not have to undertake any changes in its domestic economic policy this introduces the problem of moral hazard allowing the government in power to buck its responsibility of introducing structural reforms and in some cases to fritter away the loan money on vanity projects or to secrete it in say offshore tax havens through kickbacks on fraudulent schemes odious debt one aspect of this entire borrowing binge that has not been discussed in any depth in the media is the fees that have been paid to the international banks that have arranged and managed the pakistan government s eurobond and sukuk loans it would be in the public interest to know how much pakistan has paid in fees and other indirect charges to international commercial and investment banks for the over 7 5 billion it has borrowed since 2003 other questions arising from these transactions include how were the lead managers and bank syndicates selected were competitive bids for leads managing the transactions invited were the fees charged in line with what other countries have been paying for similar sized bond sales the ongoing corruption scandal and the outrage in malaysia over the outright theft of a significant proportion of the 6 5 billion of bond sales arranged by the american investment bank goldman sachs for the malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1mdb illustrates the need for procedural oversight and open debate whenever sovereign borrowing is undertaken as joseph stiglitz and hamid rashid write in their commentary for project syndicate there are no easy risk free paths to development and prosperity but borrowing money from international financial markets is a strategy with enormous downside risks and only limited upside potential except for the banks which take their fees up front the writer is a

factor for asian currency performance looking ahead looking at recent and expected asian fx performance ing economists highlighted three distinct phases for usd versus asian currencies advertisement phase 1 softening usd a softening of the us dollar as fed stimulus fades interspersed with periods of trade optimism supporting asian currencies an initial period of usd softness asian fx strength in which markets were relatively calm and optimistic arguably where we are now and have been since 1 january this year this could be punctuated by a brief spell of even greater euphoria on a positively spun trade announcement before march phase 2 fed policy rethink softening asian currencies the us re evaluates its position on trade and the fed revisit policy in the wake of a trade deal this phase 1 would then be followed by revision of both the trade and fed views as lack of trade substance and labour market heat led to a rethink on both issues and asian fx weakness phase 3 softer usd chinese stimulus pays off a waning of fiscal stimulus for the us dollar as chinese fiscal stimuli begin to have an effect a return to a softer usd view as fiscal stimulus ebbs cumulative us financial tightening begins to bite and chinese stimulus measures begin to bear fruit based on the above assumptions ing s forecasts for the us dollar versus a basket of asian currencies by and large sees the

next six months peaking at around 6 85 before declining towards the twelve month mark with a forecast of 6 7 above ing s us dollar chinese yuan exchange rate forecast pang commented on the impact of a fluctuating cny on trade one side effect of the stronger yuan is that it will help support imports from the us in the near term which will provide a helpful backdrop to trade negotiations pang added some renewed cny weakness during the middle of the year will support the weakening economy and chinese export markets we anticipate some recovery by the year end though with usd cny ending the year at

sakpal added we continue to see indian financial assets including the inr remaining under weakening pressure until the political dust settles in the near term the ing forecast expects the dollar to

industry we continue to see many of the world s top marketers transform their marketing organizations to adapt to changing consumer behaviors and new disruptive competitors for omnicom change provides opportunities challenges and ample room for differentiation i m pleased to report that in this rapidly changing environment our strategies talent and execution have allowed us to continue to deliver solid financial results for the full year 2018 we achieved our internal organic growth and margin targets organic growth for the quarter was 3 2 for the full year 2018 organic growth was 2 6 our ebit margin for the quarter was 15 3 an increase of 30 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 for the year our ebit margin excluding the effect of our third quarter dispositions and repositioning actions was 13 8 an increase of 20 basis points versus the prior year eps for the fourth quarter was 1 77 per share which compares to a 1 55 per share in the prior year excluding the charge related to the us tax act that we took in the fourth quarter of 2017 an increase of 14 we achieved these goals by growing our strong base of talented people investing in technology and analytic capabilities as well as continuing to differentiate our organization structure so we can deliver custom integrated solutions that drive business growth for our clients taken together these strategic steps have helped us grow both our top and bottom line in the quarter we grew organically in every geographic region of the world with broad participation across our agencies disciplines and client sectors looking at the fourth quarter growth across disciplines advertising and media was up 4 4 crm consumer experience was up 4 2 healthcare was up 7 6 pr increased 1 5 as we expected crm execution and support was the only exception it was down 3 7 in the quarter by region the us was up 2 6 driven by solid results in media healthcare and pr the us benefited from better than expected year end project spend as well as spending related to the mid term elections crm execution and support had negative growth and weighed down the performance in the us overall growth in the uk was 2 4 media and healthcare performed very well offsetting this growth was a decline in crm execution and support particularly in field marketing overall growth in our european region was 5 7 led by france italy spain and the czech republic germany again had negative growth due to specific management and operational challenges at some of our agencies we ve taken actions to address this performance and expect to see improvements asia pacific growth slowed in the quarter to 2 9 while most of the markets in the region experienced positive results the region faced tough comps relative to the prior year lastly latin america posted growth of 1 in the quarter strong results in mexico were offset by negative growth in brazil and colombia in 2018 we remain focused on executing our plan to drive efficiencies across our organization which contributed to the increase in year over year margins this performance was a result of our agency management teams remaining laser focused on controlling their cost structure our ongoing omnicomwide operational initiatives to leverage our scale in areas such as real estate accounting and it and the benefit from the disposition of lower margin non core businesses during 2018 importantly we ve been able to improve our margins while continuing to invest in our talent and our data and our analytic capabilities turning to our cash flow in 2018 omnicom generated 1 6 billion in free cash flow and returned 1 1 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases approximately 475 million in cash was used for acquisition related spend during the year our plans for the use of free cash flow remains unchanged dividend acquisition and share repurchases as we recently announced our board of directors increased the company s quarterly cash dividend to 0 65 per common share this represents an 8 3 increase in our quarterly dividend with this increase our dividend payout ratio is 45 lastly our balance sheet and liquidity remained very strong turning now to our strategy and operations 2018 was a year of significant accomplishments for omnicom we finalized the expansion of our global client leaders group organization and our practice areas which have been aligned within our global networks we continue to realign and optimize our portfolio of agencies through acquisitions and dispositions we ve made investments in technology data and analytics and as i mentioned we continue to streamline our operations in real estate accounting and it in 2016 we began the formation of practice areas together with our global client leaders group to deliver to clients a single point of access to our network of thousands of industry specials and specific marketing disciplines with strong leadership in each of our practice areas we are now positioned to better grow with existing clients strengthen our new business efforts better target our internal investments as well as create more career opportunities for our people we began with omnicom health group and omnicom pr group and now have practice areas in precision marketing and crm global advertising national advertising brand consultancy experiential marketing shopper marketing media and specialty marketing each of these areas has strong leadership who can quickly mobilize our assets to create customized solutions for our clients with the ability to create nimble flexible and integrated agency models our streamlined structure helped us win some of the biggest new business pitches in 2018 including ford creative duncan creative and volkswagen creative which we retained in key markets we also closed the year with a few major wins after a long highly contested review the us army selected omnicom agencies to deliver an integrated offering managing their marketing and pr activities over the next 10 years on the media front daimler ag awarded its global media account to omnicom media group the group will handle media for all of daimler s divisions mercedes benz cars and vans daimler trucks and buses as well as daimler financial services in 40 markets worldwide a significant part of omnicom s success is driven by our investments in technology data and analytics these investments started over a decade ago with the formation of annalect in 2018 we took another leap forward with the launch of omni a first of a kind people based precision marketing and insights platform today i m happy to report many of our agencies have deployed omni to create plan and execute personalized customer experiences at scale with some of our largest clients the platform is also transforming the way our teams work by providing a single view of their client s consumers enabling them to drive precision marketing across creative crm and media this personalization at scale is providing enormous value to our clients as important as the client wins i mentioned earlier is the way in which we achieve our success it wasn t about collapsing our agencies into one but rather investing in our agency brands and connecting them through our practice groups global client leaders and platforms like omni which allowed us to leverage our scale in an agile fluid and diverse way the growth of our business in 2018 underscores the distinctive talents of our people and the strength of our agency brands as well as our differentiated structure and service offering we know our clients today are looking for

analytics we acquired several companies in 2018 each of which strategically aligned with one of our practice areas with these bolt on acquisitions we can offer our clients more integrated end to end marketing services before handing the call off to phil i d like to make a final commentary on diversity our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workforce starts at the top in 2018 we completed the refreshment process of our board of directors omnicom s board now has 10 independent directors including six women and four african americans i m proud to say we have one of the most diverse boards in

to pursue high growth areas and opportunities through internal investments and acquisitions and we will remain vigilant on driving efficiencies throughout our organization in closing we are very pleased that our strong financial performance continues to reflect the excellence of our people and agencies and i thank everyone for their efforts i will now turn the call over to phil for a closer look at the results phil philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks john and good morning as john just described the fourth quarter results represented a strong end to omnicom s year as is essential in today s business climate our agencies remain focused on responding to our clients needs in an ever changing marketplace while at the same time they continue to manage their internal cost structures to efficiently deliver their services our business has continued to execute on both objectives we also continue to see the benefit of our companywide efforts to increase our operational efficiency regarding our revenue and starting on slide 5 for the fourth quarter we had organic growth of 3 2 or 132 million as our agencies overall did well to improve upon last year in capturing year end project spend fx again negatively impacted revenue reducing our reported revenue for the quarter by 2 or 83 million regarding acquisitions and dispositions as we spoke about during our last call we completed several dispositions during the third quarter the largest of which was sellbytel our european sales support business we also completed several acquisitions over the past year including this quarter s acquisition of the media and performance marketing division of udg a strategic digital media group in germany the net impact of our acquisition and disposition activities reduced fourth quarter revenue by about 101 million or 2 4 in line with our expectations and lastly as a reminder we were required to adopt the fasb s new revenue recognition standard known as asc 606 effective with the beginning of 2018 the impact of applying the new revenue recognition standard reduced our reported revenue by approximately 38 million or 0 9 for the quarter as a result our revenue in the fourth quarter decreased to a little under 4 1 billion when compared to q4 of last year later on i will discuss the components of the changes in revenue in more detail turning to slide 1 our operating profit for the quarter was 627 million up slightly when compared to q4 of 2017 while our operating margin of 15 3 represented a 30 basis point increase over last year s fourth quarter ebitda was 650 million and our ebitda margin of 15 9 was also up 30 basis points when compared to last year our ongoing internal initiatives to increase our operational efficiencies focusing on real estate back office services procurement and it continue to positively impact our operating income and margin performance as well as the benefits of the restructuring actions we took last quarter we also benefited from the disposition of several non strategic lower margin agencies which was partially offset by the reduction in margins caused by the negative impact of fx in the quarter net interest expense for the quarter was 53 1 million up 3 1 million versus last year s fourth quarter figure and down 3 6 million versus the 56 7 million reported in the third quarter of 2018 gross interest expense in the quarter was up 6 6 million compared to last year s q4 primarily due to the impact of increased interest rates over the past year particularly impacting our floating rate swaps while interest income increased 3 5 million due to an increase in cash held by our treasury centers when compared to a year ago when compared with q3 of this year gross interest expense in the fourth quarter decreased by 1 1 million primarily driven by the reduction in our commercial paper activity during the fourth quarter and interest income increased by 2 5 million over last year resulting from higher than average cash balances that we typically carry at year end turning to taxes our reported effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 26 1 bringing the full year tax rate to 25 6 the primary driver of the lower effective tax rate year over year was the lower us tax rate resulting from the enactment of the 2017 tax act which reduced the federal statutory tax rate 21 from 35 the effective rate for the year was slightly lower than what we previously anticipated for 2018 going forward we anticipate our effective tax rate for 2019 will be 27 which approximates our actual full year rate 2018 after excluding the following items tax impact of the repositioning actions taken in q3 the additional tax expense recorded in q3 resulting from the provisional amounts originally recorded in q4 of 2017 in connection with the tax act the successful resolution of foreign tax claims during the first quarter of 2018 and after excluding the impact of the tax benefit realized from share based compensation items particularly in q4 which we cannot predict because it is subject to changes in our share price and the impact of future stock option exercises earnings in our equity method investments was 5 3 million for the quarter upon the strength of the performance of our affiliates in asia and europe the allocation of earnings to minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased by 2 9 million to 30 5 million primarily a result of our disposition activity and the negative impact of fx since a large number of our less than fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the us as a result our net income for the fourth quarter was 399 million as a reminder in q4 last year we recorded a net increase to income tax expense 106 million related to our preliminary assessment of the impact of the passage of the 2017 tax act just before last year end although net income increased 145 million versus last year s reported net income of 254 million excluding last year s additional tax charge net income increased 39 million or 10 7 now turning to slide 2 net income available for common shareholders for the quarter was 399 million our diluted share count for q4 was 225 6 million decrease of 2 9 versus q4 of last year due to the impact of our share repurchase activity over the past 12 months as a result diluted eps for the fourth quarter was 1 77 per share that s up 0 68 versus our reported q4 2017 amount of 1 09 per share and up 0 22 or 14 2 after excluding the impact of the 106 million charge tax reform which we took in q4 of last year on slides 3 and 4 we provide the summary p l eps and other information for the full year results as a reminder in the third quarter we closed on the disposition of sellbytel along with other dispositions we completed during the third quarter that resulted in a net pre tax gain of 178 million in addition during the third quarter we recorded charges of 149 million for repositioning actions primarily resulting from severance and lease terminations lastly in q3 we recorded additional tax expense of approximately 29 million resulting from adjustments of the provisional amounts originally recorded in connection with the 2017 tax act the non gaap adjusted results on slide 22 in the supplemental section of our presentation present our full year results excluding these items since the full year results without these items are in line with our quarterly performance i will highlight just a few of them the reported operating profit for 2018 was 2 13 billion an increase of 2 4 versus last year with the resulting operating margin of 14 and finally our full year reported eps was 5 83 per share compared to 4 65 a share in 2017 excluding the impact during the third quarter of the dispositions the repositioning actions and tax reform adjustments 2018 s eps would have been 0 08 lower at 5 75 per share that s up 0 65 in comparison to 2017 s adjusted eps of 5 10 after excluding the impact of the additional 106 million in tax expense recorded in connection with the tax act at the end of 2017 returning to the details of our revenue performance in the fourth quarter on slide 5 as we discussed in detail during previous calls this year we adopted asc 606 the new revenue recognition standard and the impact of applying the new revenue recognition standard reduced our reported revenue by approximately 1 in the fourth quarter and for the full year the impact on ebit was not material because of the dollar s continued strengthening over the past several months the fx impact on our reported revenue created headwinds in the fourth quarter the impact of changes in currency rates decreased reported revenue by 2 or 83 million in revenue for the quarter and the strengthening again was widespread on a year over year basis in the fourth quarter the dollar strengthened against every one of our major foreign currencies except for the japanese yen the largest fx movements in the quarter were from the australian dollar the brazilian real the euro and the uk pound as for a projection of the fx impact for 2019 any assumption on how foreign currency rates will move over the next few months let alone the rest of the year for us is highly speculative however as we begin the year currencies stay where they currently are based on our projection fx could reduce our reported revenues by approximately 2 5 to 3 in the first half of 2019 and 1 5 for the full year the impact of our recent acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by 101 million in the quarter or 2 4 as we enter 2019 we expect the impact of acquisitions net of dispositions completed through year end will continue to be negative approximately 3 to 3 5 for the first half of 2019 and 2 5 for the year as we cycle through the sellbytel and other dispositions from 2018 finally while remaining somewhat mixed geographically and by discipline organic growth for the fourth quarter was up 3 2 primarily reflecting the positive effects client year end project spending geographically the us european and asia pacific regions had the strongest growth regarding our service disciplines our healthcare agency group had excellent growth this quarter as did our crm consumer experience agencies as well as our advertising discipline primarily driven by the strength of our media businesses slide 6 shows our mix of business by discipline for the second quarter the split was 57 for advertising and 43 for marketing services as for the organic growth by discipline our advertising discipline was up 4 4 media continues to pace the disciplines organic growth and while our global advertising agencies continue to experience mixed performance our national advertising agencies performed quite well this quarter crm consumer experience was up 4 2 organically with our precision marketing agencies leading the way in that category crm execution and support was down 3 7 this quarter as we again saw sluggish performance particularly domestically from certain businesses in that discipline pr was up 1 5 with the strongest performances coming from our domestic agencies which included a small year over year benefit from work associated with the mid term elections lastly healthcare was up 7 6 as has been the case recently the disciplines strong performance was broad based across all regions on slide 7 which details the regional mix of our business you can see during the quarter the split was 52 in the us 3 for the rest of north america 9 in the uk 19 for the rest of europe 11 for asia pacific 3 for latin america and the balance from the middle east and african markets turning to the details of our performance by region on slide 8 organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter in the us was 2 6 led by our advertising and media healthcare and pr agencies with our crm execution and support agencies lagging after a negative third quarter our uk businesses rebounded with positive organic growth of 2 4 led by our healthcare and media agencies the rest of europe was up 5 7 organically in the quarter in our europe markets france italy and spain continued to turn in strong performances across disciplines this quarter while germany again underperformed organic growth in europe outside the eurozone was positive as well organic growth in the asia pacific region was 2 9 with positive growth in all disciplines geographically we saw solid performances from our agencies in greater china india and new zealand this quarter and japan returned to positive growth latin america had organic growth of 1 in the quarter the ongoing macroeconomic issues in brazil continue to impact our businesses in the marketplace for the quarter they were down again at just over 1 offsetting brazil we continue to see positive performance elsewhere in the region particularly from our agencies in mexico the middle east and africa which was our smallest region was up 4 2 for the quarter turning to slide 9 we present our mix of revenue by our client s industry sector in comparing the full year revenue for 2018 to 2017 you can see there were some minor shifts in distribution of our client revenue by industry but nothing particularly noteworthy turning to our cash flow performance on slide 10 you can see that we generated 1 64 billion of free cash flow during the year including a positive effect from changes in working capital as well as the proceeds of 308 million from the disposition of businesses which primarily occurred in the third quarter as for our primary uses of cash on slide 11 dividends paid to our common shareholders were 549 million up due to the 5 increase in our quarterly dividend that was effective with the january 2018 payment partially offset by the reduction in share count year over year resulting from our repurchase activity dividends paid to our non controlling interest shareholders were 135 million up 33 million year on year capital expenditures increased 40 million to 196 million as we continue our real estate reconfiguration efforts to increase operational efficiency acquisitions including earn out payments were 477 million up 392 million due to an increase in acquisition activity in 18 as compared to the prior year and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled 568 million roughly the same as in 2017 excluding the 308 million of proceeds from our dispositions during the year we outspent our free cash flow by about 283 million this year primarily driven by our acquisition activity in 2018 turning to slide 12 regarding our capital structure at the end of the year our total debt is down 33 million over the past year at just under 4 9 billion our net debt position at the end of the year was 1 23 billion up 105 million compared to december 31st of 2017 the increase was principally due to the overspend of our free cash flow of 283 million and the negative impact of fx on our cash balances at year end which totaled approximately 200 million partially offsetting these was the positive change in operating capital of approximately 80 million and the cash proceeds received from the sale of subsidiaries during the year of 308 million as for our debt ratios they remain solid our total debt to ebitda ratio was 2 0 times and our net debt to ebitda ratio was 0 5 times both consistent with the ratios from this time last year while our interest coverage ratio was 9 9 times down a little over the past year due to the increase in interest expense it remains very strong on slide 13 you can see we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions for the last 12 months our return on invested capital ratio 29 6 while our return on equity was 51 4 as we anticipated both ratios were positively impacted this year by the lower us corporate tax rates enacted at the end of 2017 and finally on slide 15 we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10 years the line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2009 through 2018 which totaled 10 3 billion and the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and net share repurchases some of which during the same period was 10 7 billion this resulted in a cumulative payout ratio of 104 over the last decade and that concludes our prepared remarks please note that we ve included several other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review but at this point we re going to ask the operator to open the call for questions thank you questions and answers operator operator instructions we go to the line of alexia quadrani with jpmorgan please go ahead alexia quadrani jpmorgan analyst thank you operator one moment please ms quadrani go ahead alexia quadrani jpmorgan analyst thank you so much just a couple of questions if i may first i guess how should we think broadly about organic growth in 2019 and can we continue to see this improvement in the us and then just a second question really is on the crm execution business which remains weak i think you highlighted field marketing was particularly soft i guess are you planning to any other divestitures similar to the ones we saw in q3 thank you john d wren chief executive officer good morning alexia this is john in terms of organic growth at this point we are what will start tomorrow is the process of sitting down with our companies and going through their final profit plans for 2019 so at this point if i was making a prediction i d say organic growth is probably going to come in somewhere between 2 and 3 i think it s similar to what we said in the past some of the wins that we ve received to your second question of domestic growth i m optimistic some of the wins that we had in the fourth quarter of 2018 specifically ford and the us army they re not going to make too much of a contribution i don t think in the first quarter and half of this year but after that they should start to contribute rather significantly to our performance as domestically and in other parts of the world i don t know phil you want to add philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah just to clarify i think the 2 to 3 which was our internal target last year is for the year so that s where we re seeing 19 at the moment we don t have the best visibility given it s early february in terms of what the year is going to shake out to be and certainly a lot of things can change between now and the balance of the year but i think that s our current set of expectations john d wren chief executive officer i can promise you we will if we can do better we will with respect to your other question about crm execution we are constantly going through we did do a lot of disposals during the year but consistent with i think what we ve been telling the shareholders we ve been looking at our portfolio of companies and those that we don t think will contribute to our growth as we look forward where we are considering disposal we did quite a bit of work in the third quarter and earlier in the year that review constantly goes on and as we will continue to go on especially as we go through the next three or four weeks worth of profit planning for 2019 alexia quadrani jpmorgan analyst and then just a follow up if i may on your earlier comment you know i don t want to nitpick too much about organic growth in any one quarter because i know it s a small dollar amount that makes a change but just maybe a broader comment about the q4 performance you mentioned project business in q4 came through well which was a benefit for the better us organic growth in q4 but did you get a sense of sort of the underlying feel of the business also showed some improvement or am i trying to split hairs here that is too difficult to answer john d wren chief executive officer well you might be trying to split hairs a little bit as i think we ve said rather consistently i know i have for the last 20 years when we get to the fourth quarter there is a lot of activities that go on there are lot of budgets which client doesn t spend that they accelerate activities on there are lot of opportunities to sell additional products which motivates clients to do so and then there are some clients who try to hold back that spending to increase their p ls this year i think if i m remembering correctly 18 of the last 20 years the fourth quarter has come through with that project spending i think those one or two years during the great recession technical difficulty philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer last year was realistically a little bit easier of a comp than we ve had in years before because we didn t do as well frankly in picking up that project spend as we did this year alexia quadrani jpmorgan analyst thank you very much operator next we ll go to the line of craig huber with huber research partners please go ahead craig huber huber research partners analyst yes good morning i have three questions my first one just a follow on to alexia your organic outlook this year of 2 to 3 what is your preliminary thought on margins for the year flat or what are you thinking right now please john d wren chief executive officer phil and i maybe thinking differently again we haven t finished our profit planning at this point if i had to make a prediction i d say i m looking at them to be flat the primary headwind we have in margins is the strength of the us dollar we more or less predict for you what the impacts are going to be on the top line and we tell you that but we don t predict for you what the impact is going to be on the ebit line and that s always that always create some pressure so right now i d say margins should be flat philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean i wouldn t disagree i think we re certainly going to be working hard yield a different answer and yield some improvement but we do expect let s say we do expect to achieve some benefits from our continued operational efficiency efforts we do expect some improvement from a change in mix achieved by some of the dispositions we did in 18 businesses which on balance had a little bit lower margin than our average but fx in the fourth quarter which was negative 2 on revenue for the first time in quite some time did have a headwind on our margins in the fourth quarter and we expect fx certainly in the first half and for the year in 19 will likely be much more of a headwind how that will shake out our margins is tough to tell depending on where those fx movements happen craig huber huber research partners analyst and my second question is net new business wins in the fourth quarter what was that number please john d wren chief executive officer phil you know it philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it was a little over 1 1 billion craig huber huber research partners analyst okay great and then my last question your performance obviously for the last year was much better than your two large european peers although it wasn t as strong as it s been historically and i m just curious john it s been nowhere near nominal gdp growth per se what would you say john is the three biggest factors in your mind that held it back to up 2 6 for the year and maybe what your outlook is for each of those factors for this new year has anything significantly changed on each of those three thank you john d wren chief executive officer i think that the industry itself has been going through some changes in terms of the way the acceleration of digital and how that gets you rather than traditional forms of media some of the portfolio companies that we ve had which always contributed ebit especially in the areas of crm execution businesses like field marketing and other things companies like amazon and online delivery eliminated the need for the same type of activity that has happened on a retail level that s happened in the past so it s been the last i d say two years have been years of transition when we look at our portfolio when we look at the companies that we believe will contribute to our growth going forward we re looking at those factors and other changes in technology which are going to impact the services that we ve traditionally provided and so far we ve been able to do a pretty good job i think of identifying those areas and taking action on them where we can still get value where other people still have interest in those areas so i think that s way down a bit in terms of some of the growth the other thing that sitting and running a company you don t mind when your competitors are weak you really don t like it when your competitors are wounded because they tend to do things that they wouldn t do if they were simply weak and so it s been a rather competitive environment the last six months or so craig huber huber research partners analyst great thank you operator next we have a question from the line of julien roch with barclays please go ahead julien roch barclays analyst yes hi there my first question is can we have the impact of accuen on organic in q4 the second question is i feel several times you said that disposition had a positive impact on margin fx had a negative impact on margin and your cost as well had a positive impact on margin so could you break down the margin increase in 2018 between those three things and then the last question is in q3 you kind of offset your capital gain of 178 million by a provision for restructuring of 149 million well i assume that s mostly a provision how much of that provision did you use in q4 thank you philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure while i m answering the first two we need to get the answer on the third number but that will be in our 10 k filing so on the first two i think well the accuen number was 6 million growth in the fourth quarter and it basically was largely in the us on the margin front i can tell you fx in the fourth quarter was a negative headwind of about little over 20 basis points it s hard to split out and we don t what was the exact impact of our operational efficiencies and what was the exact impact of the dispositions but fx for the first time was negative in i m not sure i recall 20 basis points or so a meaningful difference but i think some of the listeners certainly are interested in that number so that was that rough estimate and then on can you just give me a minute on the restructurings on the restructuring front i think actually i m going to have to give you that offline julien because we have the number but i want to make sure i answer your question directly so we can give you some clarity on that offline julien roch barclays analyst okay sure thank you very much philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure operator next we go to line of dan salmon with bmo capital markets please go ahead daniel salmon bmo capital markets analyst good morning everyone john you ve done a ton of work over the last couple years continuing with divestitures and changing your portfolio of assets you ve done the reorganization around practice groups when we look across your base of business i m curious how do you think it rolls up into exposure by vertical by client vertical do you think about it that way at all looking to have maybe exposure to verticals with better secular growth over the long term and then just related to that is sort of maybe mix of your largest clients versus how important it is to you to engage some of the more up and coming innovator brands maybe what we call the direct to consumer brands more broadly we would love to hear some more thoughts on that and then phil just quickly m a was obviously considerably higher this year versus 2017 maybe that s you ve also outspent free cash flow would you say 2018 is more reflective of what you would consider a quote unquote normal year and that 2017 was unusually conservative and how we think about that to frame your thinking on your uses of free cash flow this year coming up thanks john d wren chief executive officer a couple of questions there i think if you look at the verticals i think it s slide 10 phil referred to it earlier kind of give you an indication of the industry sectors that we service since the formation of omnicom excuse me it s slide 9 since the formation of omnicom we ve always been focused on serving one blue chip clients two globally not concentrated in any one area or in any one industry and i think if you look at this slide plus we ve provided it in the past if you put a few of these years not only 18 and 17 together you ll see that that s been the case for quite a while that s in one instance if you take a look at our top 25 clients our matrix area covers up to 100 of our top clients now but just the top 25 it represents just some of the 4 billion of our revenue and we service them in many many areas and it s a concentration it s not a concentration of any particular industry there is tech there is auto there is pharma there is financial services it goes across the board very consistent with what s depicted on slide 9 in those areas where we ve been able to do that during the year those same clients contributed about 4 growth to our overall organic growth for the year so we are proving that as we have these practice areas number one focusing on skills and crafts the clients need plus a matrix system of practice areas where we bring everybody servicing that client together we re able to identify more quickly needs that clients have and adjust our portfolio and services as quickly as we possibly can so it s all moving again it s been going on for close to three years but we are very satisfied with the progress that we re making we think it will contribute to our progress going forward philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer on the m a question i think it s hard to say what 19 is going to be because we don t put together internal target with a dollar amount for our targeted m a spend and then set our m a folks and network heads off to find deals to meet that target end up doing deals that you otherwise probably would have been better off not doing but you might have met the target so we don t plan to change that approach i think our preference would be to do more m a similar to what we accomplished in 18 more accretive deals if they re available if they have the right strategic and cultural fit we don t want to do more than less so we prefer to do more deals like we did in 18 as opposed to a pretty low level in 17 but it s hard to predict i mean we ve got a number of them in the pipeline that we ve been working on and continue to work on some of them end up having a long cycle of discussions some of them we don t ultimately get close so it s hard to predict but we would certainly prefer to look more like what we accomplished in 18 and 17 daniel salmon bmo capital markets analyst great thank you both very helpful philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure operator next we go to the line of tim nollen with macquarie please go ahead tim nollen macquarie analyst good morning thanks i d just like just one question i d like to follow up on the outlook for 2019 if you could maybe give us a little bit of color on how clients are approaching spending this year just in general terms given some big macro issues such as possible slowdowns in china and brexit risk and so on just kind of how are clients thinking about spending this year versus other years and if it s possible to break down kind of an underlying client spending impact on the 2 to 3 versus new business flowing in please john d wren chief executive officer the clients that i ve spoken to and we ll get greater insight as we talk to some of our network heads over the course of next 10 days they are cognizant of the fact that there is a lot of change going on in the world you ve got brexit you ve got china slowing down is the fed going to raise interest rates is it going to stay on hold there has been quite a number of factors having said that i believe i m speaking for most of our clients and they know that they re in the business of selling products and growing their top lines so they re going to continue to do whatever activities are necessary to accomplish those tasks so there s no fear i don t get a sense of fear i don t get a sense of is this going to be you know everything is fine and there are no geopolitical or other risks out there it s just going to be another year similar to the ones we ve had in i think the last two and your second question i think i missed tim nollen macquarie analyst yeah if you could just help us understand how much of the 2 to 3 preliminary outlook is just underlying client ongoing spending versus inflow of new business because you had some nice wins toward the end of the year john d wren chief executive officer yeah you know at this point of the year we don t calculate that typically what makes up our organic growth is growth from existing clients new business wins and losses that we might have it s been net of those philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it isn t a single number and it isn t that easy to kind of capture it from a definition perspective it might down pretty straightforward and simple but when you collect the data at the detail level and roll it up that there s quite a bit of judgment in terms of how those things fall into each of those buckets so we don t have that kind of information readily available at this point tim nollen macquarie analyst okay sure thanks a lot philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer i think the market is about to open we have time for one more call operator operator okay it s the line of jason bazinet with citi please go ahead jason bazinet citi analyst i just had a quick question you were very kind to talk about the headwind next year acquisitions and net of dispositions on the topline and talked about those disposed assets also having lower margins i just wondered if the disposed assets also had slower growth and might sort of help your organic growth or maybe indeed they were faster growing it might be a headwind but any color on the impact to your organic growth would be helpful from the dispositions john d wren chief executive officer personally i m not anticipating it having a significant statistically measurable type of impact on our overall performance in terms of organic growth what we were doing the reason we got a value i think for the companies that we did dispose of was because of we were projecting out several years and saying that unless we became tremendously larger in these particular areas we probably wouldn t be able to sustain the growth that we had and so therefore we made a decision that somebody else could do a better job with those assets and that s why we got rid of them so i don t have that calculation for you philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think we did that calculation in q3 but it s not one that we ve kind of baked into our internal processes and systems because we typically try not to carve out all the bad stuff leaving all the good stuff but i think it s safe to say that as a portfolio as we look at 19 the businesses we disposed of in 18 were not growing faster than our overall organic growth profile in 2018 for the rest of the business exactly how much from a dollars or percentage perspective by quarter we don t think the numbers are going to be that meaningful and we don t have them at hand jason bazinet citi analyst okay very helpful thank you very much philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure okay well thank you everybody for joining the call and we ll talk to you again soon operator ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference for today thank you for your participation and for using at t teleconference you may now disconnect duration 62 minutes call participants shub mukherjee vice president of

lekan sote if a motto is a sentence phrase or word inscribed on something indicative of its character or use or is a short expression of a guiding principle one of president muhammadu buhari s re election campaign themes doing more with less could serve as the motto of his government an insignia of his government s claim to have prudently managed the lean resources at its disposal a social media posting contrasts 92 2bn revenue received by the president buhari government between 2015 and 2018 and the n2 7tn it spent on infrastructure between 2016 and 2017 to the 228 76bn received by former president goodluck jonathan s government between 2010 and 2014 and the n1 27tn it spent on infrastructure between 2011 and 2012 infrastructure is key to nigeria s next economic trajectory even mama olubisi osinbajo thinks that the government of president buhari has done well with available resources what they did in three years other people couldn t do it in 16 years her sentiment as mother of vice president yemi osinbajo is understandable at the 2019 economic outlook lecture of the economic discourse series of the institute of chartered accountants of nigeria the guest speaker dr ayo teriba observes that a global commodity supply glut since mid 2014 depressed global commodity prices and eroded nigeria s export earnings he adds the slump in export revenues inflicted a shortage of foreign exchange on nigeria and businesses could not have enough foreign exchange to fund vital imports nigeria s liquidity shortfall got compounded as america surpassed norway russia and nigeria as the major supplier of petroleum to great britain the resulting loss of revenue led to nigeria s 2016 recession naira devaluation and inflation this explains teriba s observation that nigeria s gross domestic product comprises of an oversized commodity exporting sector whose revenue is dwindling a hyperactive service sector exemplified by the telecoms an unproductive manufacturing sector and a trading sector that thrives on imported consumer goods ican president rasaq jaiyeola doubts that budget 2019 will meet its projected target he queries the budget s crude oil price and production projections the central bank of nigeria reported a n910 41bn fiscal deficit in the third quarter of 2018 these confirm teriba s common sense claim that reduced revenue compromises liquidity even as he startled everyone with the claim of liquidity glut in the western financial system the global liquidity glut resulted from deliberate liquidity injections from leading central banks teriba s recommendation for nigeria to access the excess funds that are floating abroad is already being achieved through the oversubscribed 4 5bn eurobond of 2017 and 1 3bn provided by the quartet of the world bank german development bank african development bank and agence franchise de development to float the development bank of nigeria recently licensed by the cbn the cbn governor godwin emefiele adds that global developments that have had significant impact on nigeria s economy are rising global lending rates capital flight high exchange rates and regional politics that emphasise trade protectionism the cbn s responses included initiatives to conserve foreign exchange by restricting access to foreign exchange on 41 consumer items encourage manufacturers to consider local options for raw materials and introduction of the anchor borrowers programme which provides loans to farmers and geared to reduce importation of consumer goods like rice the monetarist policymakers must not discountenance the reservations of henry boyo economist industrialist and ace columnist with the punch newspaper he insists that taming inflation by controlling interest and foreign exchange rates is key to nigeria s economic recovery and gdp growth boyo is alarmed that the cbn wilfully raises the value of the dollar against its own naira and inexcusably raises interest rate by mopping up what it calls excess liquidity these boyo thinks further raise inflation interest and foreign exchange rates and crowd out domestic enterprises from accessing loans you need teriba s perspective to interrogate the policy of the president buhari government if lower revenue will trouble the next government the nigerian electorate must look for good resource managers in the next president and members of the national assembly if teriba seems to be explaining president buhari s economic policy it is probably because he is involved with the government in more ways than one he is a member of the government s team of economic advisers the national council for privatisation and the presidential advisory committee on new national wage in addition to political restructuring which emeka anyaoku former secretary general of the commonwealth describes as the road to nigeria s political stability and realisation of its potential the economy is the major issue for consideration in the next election anyaoku said judging by all indices nigeria today is clearly underperforming former american president barack obama observed that elections have consequences if 87 million nigerians living on less than 1 90 per day must exit poverty nigeria s 84 million registered voters must think deep before casting their votes in the next election the director general of the budget office ben akabueze and ceo of mcsa worldwide projects dr mark abani who just stopped short of goading nigerians to use their votes to liberate themselves economically encourage nigerians to make their grievances known to their representatives at the national assembly akabueze expresses anguish that even after government broke down the petroleum industry bill into phases for legislation starting with the petroleum industry governance bill politics frustrated its enactment he stopped short of mentioning the national assembly as the culprit to put it in a perspective for business nigerians must vote to compel governments to come up with economic policies that will further improve the ease of doing business index so that the economy can service foreign trade and attract foreign investment and loans in 2017 nigeria moved 24 points up the ease of doing business index ladder and earned a place on the list of 10 most improved economies kola adesina the group managing director of sahara power group owners of electricity generating firms egbin power plc and first independent power limited rivers state and ikeja electricity distribution company thinks that government policies and stakeholder collaboration should facilitate new investments in the growth and expansion of nigeria s energy sector teriba suggests that securitisation or selling of substantial shares of national assets to investors is the best way to solve the nation s infrastructure deficit debacle he points to the telecom companies and the nigerian liquefied natural gas company as good examples of the success story of private participation in providing and running efficient infrastructure while the federal government will be the first to admit that there may not have been seismic improvements in the economy or of infrastructure it can praise its chest on the steady though inadequate increase in generation and distribution of electricity upgrade of the railway lines and increase in road rehabilitation these can be easily confirmed and speaking specifically about the presidential election nigerians have another opportunity to retain the current economic managers and stay the slow but somewhat cruising course or go out on a limb and elect another set of managers some of whom have integrity deficit correctness of rhetoric superlative credentials or are even revolutionaries rookies and rabble rousers experience should guide nigerians in deciding who was is or will be able to understand the grace notes of economists who recommend rational allocation of scarce resources twitter lekansote1 copyright

illustration by tang yau hoong there can be few more eye catching signs of the economic vibrancy of southeast asia than competition for ride hailing services on the streets of its biggest cities in jakarta the bustling capital of indonesia it is hard to miss the green helmeted motorbike taxi riders of go jek a homegrown company that has built a thriving ride hailing business in only eight years go jek which derives its name from ojek an indonesian word for motorbike taxi launched its first overseas foray in september 2018 by entering vietnam and tapping into the fast growing ride hailing scene in ho chi minh city hanoi and other cities next up are expansions into thailand the philippines and singapore those moves will pit go jek against the region s biggest ride hailing company singapore based grab and competitors such as ryde and mvl sparking a battle for the region s booming ride sharing market it is a tussle involving considerable sums of money from some big investors grab founded by a malaysian businessman and operating in eight markets in southeast asia raised us 2 billion in 2018 after a round of funding that attracted investment from toyota and valued the company at 11 billion go jek which already counts chinese e commerce giant tencent and singapore s state investment company temasek as investors reportedly is in discussions to raise 2 billion to bolster its regional expansion plans ride sharing companies are just one example of the rampant commercial activity in southeast asia the association of southeast asian nations asean a 10 nation bloc founded in 1967 stretches from myanmar in the west to the philippines on its eastern flank the other eight members are brunei cambodia indonesia laos malaysia singapore thailand and vietnam the grouping has a population of 630 million 30 percent larger than the combined population of the nafta countries and its nations had a combined gdp of 2 76 trillion in 2017 which is larger than the gdp of india and makes asean the fifth largest economy in the world its dynamism its growing middle class and the entrepreneurial flair of its businesses have made asean one of the consistently best performing regions in the world since the 2008 financial crisis so it s no surprise that a large number of investors and multinationals are turning their focus to asean s dynamic markets the bloc s economies are at vastly different stages of political and economic development singapore s gdp per capita of 57 713 dwarfs that of myanmar at 1 278 as of 2017 but they all share immense growth potential and aside from serving as a major global hub for manufacturing and trade the bloc offers one of the fastest growing consumer markets in the world the region s middle class is projected to rise to almost two thirds of the overall population by 2030 compared with only 29 percent in 2010 having grown at a 4 8 percent rate for the last five years asean is projected to grow by 5 2 percent on average over the next five years according to the oecd cambodia laos myanmar and vietnam are expected to record growth rates among the highest in the region ranging between 6 and 7 percent over the same period few regions of the world or individual countries can project such numbers at the 50th meeting of asean economic ministers in november 2018 in singapore which held the customary rotating chair of the bloc throughout that year the city state s prime minister lee hsien loong predicted that the grouping would be the world s fourth largest economy by 2030 behind only the u s china and the european union much of the region s strength can be attributed to a demographic dividend fully 60 percent of its vast population is under 35 years old and as these young workers have entered the workforce in huge numbers they have proved a valuable source of human capital and growing consumer power most of go jek s and grab s indonesian motorbike drivers are under 35 however as other countries in the region have found there is another side to the demographic story an aging population vietnam is a case in point the third most populous country in asean it is also one of the most rapidly aging countries in the world in 2017 one in every nine people or 11 percent of vietnam s population of 95 million was age 60 or older according to the government statistics office that proportion will rise to about 20 percent by 2038 the international monetary fund forecasts that neighboring thailand faces the likelihood that by 2050 its old age dependency ratio those 65 and older as a share of those between 15 and 64 will rise to more than 50 percent up from 15 percent today a development that will noticeably shrink the country s working age population this structural shift points to an emerging drag on asean s growth prospects because it spells a net decline in working age populations in some of its leading economies see the demographic challenge in the asia pacific region in short some countries have a limited demographic window available to maximize economic growth indeed the graying population provides but one argument for our contention that the era of passive growth for asean is over despite a growth story that has been largely unblemished since the asian financial crisis of the late 1990s a number of challenges have raised questions about the sustainability of the bloc s growth trajectory over the next half century these include external challenges such as a recent slowdown in short term economic growth and the impact of industry 4 0 as well as three major internal challenges weak productivity high external trade dependence and huge infrastructure gaps but demographic trends are not necessarily destiny and neither are the other structural challenges asean faces the region has a suite of advantages and resources it can deploy to power through the rising headwinds and we believe that by confronting and addressing its challenges head on by taking active measures the 10 members of asean can show the world that the timely interventions that so often have eluded governments and regional groupings in the past not only are possible but indeed can chart a new trajectory for sustainable prosperity asean s trajectory is also of high relevance to companies in the u s europe and other parts of asia such as japan because of the strategic importance of the bloc s markets shipping lanes supply chains and supply of industrial labor the narrow malacca strait is the busiest shipping lane between the indian ocean and the pacific ocean thailand is the region s hub for automotive production and is sometimes dubbed the detroit of the east thanks to its highly developed automotive manufacturing ecosystem involving big oems such as general motors and nissan as well as suppliers malaysia has a well developed electronics cluster centered on the port city of penang with shipping and air freight connections globally the philippines has a thriving business process outsourcing sector that is used by many multinational companies and singapore is the region s undisputed financial and commodities trading center it also boasts the world s largest bunkering fuel storage port collectively the nations of asean represent a vast market of mobile savvy consumers and e commerce digital payments and fintech generally are booming adapting is of particularly high relevance now thanks to tectonic shifts underway in geopolitics and the evolving nature of global trading relationships demographic changes and the spread of globalization have served as twin engines propelling the region s growth and as the aging population saps one source of propulsion uncertainties about the evolution of the global trading system could further weaken momentum there is a risk that asean s core value proposition of lower labor costs could fade away over the coming decades as protectionist sentiment rises and new technologies improve the economics of retaining or re shoring production within the borders of the developed parts of the world the political mood in many countries has shifted against free trade and in particular the recent trade tensions between the united states and china are worrying concerns singapore s prime minister lee told the asean summit at the end of 2018 asean countries will have to react to these major external trends internal challenges in an increasingly competitive global economy stagnating productivity is becoming more of a concern around the world and in asean labor productivity has doubled across the bloc since 1990 but industry data indicates a wide gap between asean and global markets at present that highlights an opportunity for the bloc to improve through interventions such as investments in human capital infrastructure development institutional improvements and digital technology adoption the international labour organization ilo found in 2017 that most countries in asean especially the emerging markets recorded much lower output per worker than their global counterparts see the labor productivity gap but singapore widely recognized for the economic miracle it has achieved since its creation as an independent city state in 1965 recorded a mere 0 2 percent growth in labor productivity in 2015 16 a fraction of the more than 2 percent annual growth over 2000 10 thailand and malaysia scored comparatively poorly as well these two maturing economies are also witnessing strong growth in wage levels while already having some of the highest minimum wages in asean although such wage growth bolsters consumer spending it also increases the need to improve worker productivity to counter growing labor costs in fact rising wage levels soon will dilute the low cost advantage enjoyed by many emerging asean markets over competitors in their hemisphere and around the world some asean countries are estimated to have recorded among the highest real wage increases worldwide in 2017 with vietnam 7 2 percent thailand 5 6 percent and indonesia 4 9 percent leading the trend these figures are much higher than the global average of 2 3 percent the misalignment of productivity and wage growth will gradually lead to diminishing economic competitiveness greater unemployment lower profit margins and diminished investor confidence coupled with an aging population the pincers of weak productivity and strong wage growth will put further pressure on these economies to strengthen their institutions and capabilities and thus strengthen their long term economic prospects but for more immediate help one place to look is digital technologies which can significantly affect productivity according to the most recent annual global connectivity index released by huawei technologies a single point improvement in a nation s digital connectivity score which runs on a scale from 20 to 85 could lead to more than a 2 percent increase in productivity and national competitiveness developed asean countries singapore brunei in particular having more advanced institutions and infrastructure and hence limited scope for improvement on this front as well as having aging populations should focus on increasing their adoption of technology to counter declining productivity growth asean markets will need to prioritize productivity improvement measures to boost economic growth or risk losing out to global competitors in addition to making regulatory interventions such as a reduction in non tariff trade barriers this will also require local governments and the private sector to invest in new digital technologies and infrastructure development the grouping also needs to figure out how to navigate technological disruption industry 4 0 which is bringing new technologies such as automation augmented reality cloud computing and the internet of things iot to bear on established processes and facilities could produce much needed benefits in the form of better jobs greater connectivity improved services such as healthcare and education and more business and investment however as with any revolution some people feel a negative impact in the short term asean could be such a potential victim of industry 4 0 take automation we see a scenario in which multinational corporations re shore some manufacturing to developed markets and adopt 4 0 technologies in those plants they keep in asean a scenario that would hit a less developed asean member such as cambodia or myanmar particularly hard in general the results could lead to increased unemployment a reduction in disposable incomes and potential social unrest and economic contraction in an increasingly competitive global economy stagnating productivity is becoming more of a concern around the world and in asean in addition technological disruption comes with its own set of challenges for example if robots become cheaper to employ than humans will expanding manufacturing capacity still lead to job creation in a 2016 report the ilo found that around 56 percent of all employment in five key emerging asean countries cambodia indonesia the philippines thailand and vietnam faced a high risk of automation in the subsequent 20 years together these five countries represent a vast majority about 80 percent of asean s workforce at present creating a vibrant and integrated innovation ecosystem to teach it and technology skills is another issue asean will have to deal with in order to minimize these potential job losses such an ecosystem will require closer collaboration among different stakeholders including large multinationals entrepreneurs government agencies and research institutions to foster skills in new areas relevant to a digitized world such as data sciences digital user experience human centered design and cybersecurity intra regional cooperation will need to be enhanced more advanced production hubs such as singapore and thailand will need to take the lead in testing new technologies and in developing best practices to improve adoption across the rest of the region and among less productive segments such as small and medium sized enterprises balancing trade external trade dependence the degree to which a region produces goods and services for countries outside the region has been a persistent feature of asean for many years in particular the bloc faces significant risks associated with its high level of dependence on the u s and on china which together accounted for 26 percent of trade in goods as of 2017 asean exports to china increased in value by an average of 10 percent annually over the past 10 years reaching 17 percent of all asean trade in goods in 2017 any deepening of the current slowdown in the chinese economy amid efforts to shift it to a more consumption driven model could impact trade the extent of these linkages can be judged by estimates released by oxford economics which suggest that a drop of one percentage point in china s gdp growth in the future could reduce asean exports by 0 3 to 0 6 percent moreover global trade growth is also slowing down with the wto downgrading its outlook for 2018 and 2019 citing significant downside risks to its growth projections at the same time intra asean trade i e commerce between member states although it has risen in value from 164 billion in 2005 to 311 billion in 2017 has remained stagnant over the past decade at around 25 percent of all exports by contrast intra european union e u trade represented 64 percent of overall e u exports in 2017 to a large degree production in asean consists of so called intermediate goods such as electronic components that are part of global supply chains and thus destined for end markets where the goods are either assembled or consumed get the strategy business newsletter delivered to your inbox sample email email address ominously protectionist sentiment is rising around the world this has been expressed most vividly in the region by the withdrawal of the u s from the trans pacific partnership tpp in 2017 and could further threaten asean s trade growth it is therefore important for the group to take active measures to increase intra regional trade flows to not only serve the fast growing domestic consumer base but also counterbalance these additional risks a key measure needed to help boost intraregional trade is the strengthening of regional cooperation especially through the reduction of non tariff trade barriers mahathir mohamad malaysia s 93 year old prime minister told policymakers and business leaders at the 2018 singapore summit that pushing the 25 percent share up to 30 percent might seem ambitious but was possible given the grouping s strength in numbers this is not the time to close our doors by invoking trade protectionism measures but instead we should be actively engaging in finding amicable solutions and resolving trade issues through multilateral dialogues such as between asean countries the prime minister said the good news is that 96 percent of tariff lines and 70 percent of intra asean trade flows are currently tariff free but customs and levies aren t the only factors that inhibit trade the elephant in the room in this context is the many non tariff barriers in the region the result of the steady implementation by asean member states of non tariff measures ntms there has been a consistent rise in the number of ntms which are often aimed at bolstering domestic companies and industries and which have stifled intraregional activity see erecting barriers this mix of import and export related policies has grown substantially from 1 634 measures in the year 2000 to a high of 5 975 measures in 2015 across asean in terms of the type of ntms 43 percent are import restrictions related to technical product requirements 33 percent take the form of sanitary measures related to public health and safety and 13 percent are export related restrictions as an example of an ntm in asean a company certified to sell halal food products in malaysia needs to undergo recertification to export to indonesia to adhere to the indonesian industry s halal standard which has significant time and cost implications for the exporter similarly the thai government imposes stringent licensing requirements for the import of raw materials petroleum industrial machinery textiles pharmaceuticals and agricultural items infrastructure gaps patchy infrastructure is a third significant challenge although the stage of development varies significantly from country to country it is clear that across asean people s daily experience is too often one of clogged roads inadequate bridges and regular power outages as in other developing parts of the world infrastructure limitations continue to slow the pace of growth significant gaps exist across a range of sectors for example utilities transportation and logistics and digital connectivity as of mid 2018 only 20 percent of roads in myanmar were paved and only 53 percent of cambodian households had access to grid quality electricity the indonesian national development planning agency estimates that a lack of adequate transportation infrastructure and the resultant traffic congestion accounts for more than 4 billion in annual losses to the city of jakarta in the form of fuel wastage productivity losses and health impact on its residents total infrastructure investment needs in asean from 2016 to 2030 are estimated by the asian development bank adb to be around 2 8 trillion indicating an annual investment requirement of 184 billion equivalent to 7 percent of the bloc s gross domestic product in 2017 in addition to reducing the productive capacity of the workforce these gaps increase the cost of doing business for companies hindering national competitiveness while limiting market access and social well being for example logistics costs in 2016 represented about 9 percent of gross domestic product in germany and 12 percent in brazil in vietnam the figure was 21 percent whereas in indonesia asean s largest economy and most populous nation it was as high as 26 percent yet enhancing the scale and quality of infrastructure could have a significant economic impact on these countries especially in helping to manage looming issues related to productivity and job creation for example estimates by the adb indicate that a 10 percent increase in paved road density could result in a 1 percent increase in trade and a 5 percent improvement in economic growth across asia finally a significant gap exists in terms of what we might call institutional maturity as is the case in most emerging economies the business environment in asean is still maturing and is marked by institutional gaps that weaken international investor confidence and the region s growth more so during periods of global uncertainty corruption in particular features as a major concern for businesses operating in the region in the asean business outlook survey 2017 conducted by the u s chamber of commerce 65 percent of respondents cited what they saw as unfair and inefficient law enforcement practices as a major challenge in the region with the exception of singapore and brunei those operating in the mekong region said they faced stronger pressures to pay bribes in order to obtain essential permits and government services besides corruption lack of regulatory clarity continues to impede growth a significant percentage of businesses 42 percent indicated that consultations between the government and the private sector were limited while new laws and regulations were being developed a path forward the scale of challenges asean faces is immense and seemingly daunting but the region has substantial resources at its disposal and we believe that three sets of active measures will allow the region to continue to make progress through the headwinds it faces the first involves renewed efforts by the asean secretariat which was set up in 1976 to coordinate the bloc s initiatives and provide governance and implementation help for policies a key priority for the jakarta based body should be facilitating internal trade in particular fostering the harmonization of multiple non trade barriers to create a more fluid internal economy within asean a boost to the secretariat s budget and staff would be helpful too the second set of measures would be for member countries to tackle head on their shared demographic challenges in productivity and aging populations given that countries are at different stages of development and face different degrees of demographic challenge these measures should include short term policy interventions such as addressing talent gaps through encouraging inward migration and long term reforms targeted at improving the labor force participation of women and older people for example in fast aging markets such as singapore and thailand only 60 percent of women participated in the workforce in 2017 compared with 77 percent of men specific interventions will also need to target a range of other levers including human capital trade technology and investments which will vary by market in asean see demographic and income trends in asean countries the third set of measures revolves around the private sector which will have a major role to play in making these interventions in asean and thus in strengthening the region s growth prospects over the coming years companies will need not only to provide new products and services to meet varying consumer preferences but also to work more closely with governments to develop the right conditions for businesses to prosper the principal measures the private sector should pursue are described below develop more localized business models conduct more research and development locally bringing about a transition to more localized sourcing production and sales through the development of regional hubs to serve asean consumers for example automakers looking to establish a bigger foothold in the region can increase localization more holistically in sourcing manufacturing sales and research and development doing so will allow them to offer greater competitiveness more localized products and greater differentiation this strategy could be adopted in phases as companies gain further appreciation of local markets shifting from a production model based on semi knocked down assembly in which factories receive partially assembled parts to one based on assembling completely knocked down kits in which factories receive unassembled parts and then finally to full scale production automakers can progress to the final stage of full scale production as they establish more reliable long term production volumes aiming to achieve local sourcing of 70 percent or more to fully leverage tax incentives in the region it will also be important to work with government and associations to ensure that the right level of skilled workers are coming into the market healthcare offers a particularly compelling opportunity for developing localized business models government and healthcare leaders are aware that this region is at a critical point with its aging population chronic diseases such as diabetes will need to be tackled with appropriate care at an affordable price medical device companies have an important job in asean to improve the access affordability and quality of healthcare but rather than simply import expensive devices from the u s and europe medical device companies might borrow a page from china s or india s playbook and seek to build customized and affordable devices for the market using local and regional business models to meet patients needs for example ge healthcare found that its premium priced ultrasound scanners were unaffordable for 90 percent of hospitals in china through local r d sales and marketing ge healthcare s china team developed a handheld ultrasound scanner at 15 percent of the original cost this product is now being used even in developed markets as a portable scanner in ambulances and operating rooms to further improve affordability companies can also offer financing alternatives to local hospitals such as leasing and contracting of medical equipment supplemented with a regular program of upgrading and maintaining the equipment embrace a holistic digital operating model the adoption of digital capabilities can improve the production and transportation of goods and services as well as communication with consumers and businesses with expectations of mass customization being brought about by industry 4 0 a unified asean market promises the formation of a truly massive consumer base that could push growth in local production to meet its requirements for more personalized products coupled with quicker order fulfillment in segments such as footwear accessories and consumer electronics companies have a significant opportunity to grow across asean by leveraging digital capabilities not only to connect directly with consumers to inform and influence purchasing habits but also to employ greater efficiencies throughout their supply chain using platforms such as iot or blockchain to track and trace assets products people equipment across the value chain or to improve access to trade finance for smaller enterprises furthermore warehouses which are currently labor and paper intensive are ripe for conversion to automated systems providing better visibility on inventory technological change brings exciting solutions to persistent problems yet is disrupting jobs and economic development pathways justin wood head of the regional agenda for asia pacific and member of the executive committee at the world economic forum points out the countries of asean have every chance of harnessing these disruptions for their benefit but success will require a new approach to policymaking and new commitment to regional cooperation use partnerships and integration models developing partnerships and alliances that cross sectors and involve industry disruptors will be crucial as companies try to stay relevant and competitive while meeting consumers expectations profitably new business models such as platform sharing for example for automotive production or vertical integration such as fuel refining with petrochemicals are other strategies relevant to addressing the increasing cost of production in asean platform sharing enables cost savings from the use of similar components and more efficient inventory management and allows automakers to redirect spending to other areas such as adapting models to regional consumers or improving product design similarly integrating refining units with petrochemical facilities could enhance operational efficiencies through greater synergy and flexibility in operations resulting in much stronger margins an integrated complex with crude processing capacity of around 200 000 barrels per stream day could generate gross margins of approximately 9 to 15 per barrel depending on market conditions and operational factors as compared with only 3 to 6 per barrel for a stand alone refinery governments in the region see these challenges through a domestic lens which is understandable given the developing economic maturity of most of its member nations yet we think they should recognize the value of regional integration and cooperation and take action to strengthen the position of asean on a number of fronts so that it can maintain its reputation as the world s most compelling growth story annual gdp growth in leading asean economies both emerging and developed has been on a downward trajectory since peaking in 2010 as global uncertainties result in somewhat stagnant growth projections in the short term the good news is that much of what needs to be done is already underway take for example the strategies and the growth of burgeoning ride sharing companies such as go jek and grab both have pioneered localized business models because they are homegrown and tailored to local workers and customers they have been able to establish a strong market presence both are embracing holistic digital operating models relying on apps and connectivity to deliver a new type of service and to function as a platform for other types of businesses including payments both are in effect facilitating intra asean connectivity and taking a broader view of their horizons by operating in multiple countries within asean the need in the coming years will be for more companies organizations governments and leaders to be equally proactive and innovative in developing and executing strategies that will fulfill the potential of asean it s time to act author profiles david wijeratne is a partner with pwc singapore he leads pwc s growth markets centre a global team of experts

a failure by u s and chinese negotiators to reach an agreement by the march 1 deadline set by u s president donald trump could raise the stakes in the global trade war trump s threat to more than double american tariffs on chinese goods after that date would escalate a bruising battle that s shaken the world economy and caused companies to reconfigure their supply chains 1 what s so important about march 1 that s the end of a 90 day trade war truce that trump and china s xi jinping agreed to on the sidelines of a group of 20 summit in argentina in december under that truce the u s agreed to delay a planned increase to 25 percent from 10 percent in tariffs on almost half the goods the u s buys from china worth some 200 billion american and chinese officials have been negotiating since then but with trump saying he and xi won t meet again before march 1 fears are intensifying that there won t be a deal though trump has also suggested he could agree to extend negotiations if progress is being made 2 how else might this escalate if trump goes forward with the higher 25 percent tariffs china could reply with countermeasures and that could prompt trump to follow through on threats to slap duties on at least a further 267 billion of goods 3 what s the risk for u s consumers and businesses american shoppers have been mostly insulated from the trade war since headline inflation remains tame and the tariffs have steered clear of staples like clothing footwear and toys that could change a january report by bank of america corp analysts said any escalation of the trade war would be much more painful for the u s triggering renewed market volatility and undermining investor confidence 4 what s the risk for china an escalation would deepen the slowdown in economic growth and pressure the government to respond with higher public spending that would likely be funded by debt undermining the government s quest to reduce the country s heavy debt burden bloomberg economics estimates china would avoid a 0 3 percent drag on 2019 gross domestic product if the trade truce holds their base case assuming an escalation is avoided is for economic growth in china to slow to 6 2 percent in 2019 down from 6 6 percent in 2018 5 what are the sticking points to a deal enforcement intellectual property protection and technology trump has pledged that any deal will contain strong enforcement language yet his aides are still figuring out what that should be and how to get china to sign off the world trade organization is one possible arena for policing a deal but the u s administration has shown little patience for it beyond promises to buy more u s goods it s tough to see what the chinese side will agree to especially given their ongoing denials regarding forced technology transfers or other alleged misbehavior the widening u s government crackdown on huawei technologies co a chinese telecommunications giant underscores the challenge for officials in beijing 6 why are we in a trade war trump routinely points to the large u s trade deficit the difference between imports and exports as a symbol of a declining manufacturing base and the loss of american might he aims to reduce the goods and services gap with china which totaled 566 billion in 2017 by both browbeating and enticing u s companies to import less and export more he s imposed tariffs which act like a tax on imports on foreign made solar panels and washing machines shipped into the u s steel and aluminum from countries including allies canada mexico and the european union and 250 billion of goods from china including furniture and food in the u s some business groups say trump s metal tariffs and retaliatory duties that came in response have hurt u s industry farmers and workers 7 will trump s strategy work it depends on who blinks first after months of on again off again talks china agreed in principle to increase imports of u s agricultural products along with energy industrial products and services as part of a path to eliminate its u s trade imbalance that promise might form the basis of a preliminary agreement though the tariffs may stay in place while the two sides work out differences in the tougher issues of intellectual property the heavy involvement of the state in china s economy and mechanisms for the enforcement of any deal in october trump s threat to abandon the north american free trade agreement prompted canada and mexico the two other signatories of that treaty to agree to revisions tariffs on metals and threatened duties on cars had the eu and japan also looking to deal meanwhile the u s trade deficit widened in 2018 partly because the stronger dollar made u s exports pricier 8 what s been the impact so far investors and executives routinely cite the trade war between the world s two biggest economies as one of the biggest threats to all kinds of businesses the international monetary fund cutting its forecast for the world economy for the second time in three months due in part to trade tensions said in january that global growth would be 3 5 percent in 2019 9 what are companies saying a lot apple starbucks volkswagen and fedex are among those to have cited a slowing chinese economy in their outlooks more than 400 publicly traded chinese companies warned on their earnings while the trade war is only one factor that s weighing on demand weakness in europe and the impact of fading u s fiscal stimulus are others it s probably the issue that most concerns executives some are even looking at uprooting their supply chain
this article is more than 5 years old the happy meal toy making days of china are long gone they re making robots there now china s private companies like huawei are building smart cities in far away places like bogota colombia theyir scientists are building and sending spacecraft to the dark side of the moon china s gone from the 1980s maker of cheap clothes that shrink after a few washings to the hottest growth market for every single luxury designer brand in europe the communist party led by xi jinping wants to make china the corporate power of asia by 2025 it s well on its way if you take the u s intelligence agencies at their word then china is the biggest ideological and geopolitical threat facing the u s it s not isis it s not the russians though they come in a close second or the iranians third it s the chinese according to the 2019 worldwide threat assessment report the takeaway from washington is this you cannot have the no 1 economy in the world be a capitalist democratic system and the no 2 economy be a hybrid capitalist system ruled by the communist party a party that sets the table for economic development the rules are totally different something s got to give so far china has opened a bit more and the u s has closed a bit more by way of increasing trade tariffs these are two different systems says scott clemons chief investment strategist with brown brothers harriman i don t blame china for what they are doing it s the west that wanted to weave china into the global economy they ve acheived that china has a lot on its plate it has unfavorable demographics and no real safety net it s doing what it has to do for its people the trump administration s view is that it s time the u s do something for its people too on tuesday senator marco rubio released an 80 page report on china s stellar rise up the economic food chain that warns of negative outcomes if the u s does not act the report covers potential policy responses and challenges to beijing s made in 2025 program which promises to make china the next silicon valley and surely asia s tech powerhouse think japan 1980s on human growth hormone which is a good comparison actually because in the blood sport of global trade team america thinks team china is juicing much of their rise in tech know how has come from technological transfer requirements as a cost of entering into a joint venture with a chinese company in the mainland some of it has come from theft of intellectual property for rubio the solution is somewhat chinese though his senior policy aides were quick to point out that the florida senator is not calling for top down economic planning markets are a force for good they were sure to note however a lack of industrial policy here at home means there is no coordinated effort to rival the actual coordinated effort in china that is designed to compete with and maybe beat american tech companies see don t believe bejing china really does rival the u s forbes the role of government is to align our economic policies with the right national priorities rubio said in a video recorded for the senate small business entrepreneurship committee today right now we have the wrong priorities our most important priority should be creating dignified work through investment and through innovation that will require the hard work of forming a new consensus but we can build an america that is better for the future generations he said some have criticized rubio s call for a higher capital gains tax a move he thinks might get u s tech companies to spend more on research and development than in stock buybacks rubio s policy advisor team said that chinese companies in the tech space are spending more on r d than in stock buybacks for sure but it is unclear how much the u s spends versus china that also depends on what is measured china s government spends billions on funding startups for example highly leveraged investments in technological discovery offer unknown outcomes but distributions to shareholders are quantifiable the existence of nonproductive alternatives to capital investment makes the product of the firm s american workers less valuable using capital to buy back shares increases asset prices but it can also mean lower investment in the economy and therefore lower worker pay rubio s report authors wrote see china thinks it s an emerging market it sure doesn t look like one forbes 2019 bloomberg finance lp since entering the wto in 2001 china has grown beyond anyone s wildest dreams china exports have exploded in nearly ever big money manufacturing sector that includes sectors that employ blue collar labor at middle income salaries railroad equipment 600 increase from 2001 to 2017 machinery and equipment 900 cars 1 200 marine vehicles 1 100 and airplanes 1 200 according to the organization for economic cooperation development u s growth has been good as well for a developed market but marine vehicles and high r d technology exports have declined as china s rose over the 1997 2017 period according to the oecd working class jobs in areas like machinery and equipment manufacturing fabricated metals automotive paper and pulp and textiles have all seen wage growth fall below inflation over the last 20 years according to the oecd following months of tit for tat tariffs between the two sides the world is slowly discovering that the confrontation between the u s and china extends far beyond trump s concern over trade balances the chinese government is determined to acquire american technology and they re willing to use a variety of means to do that from foreign investments corporate acquisitions and cyber intrusions to obtaining the services of current or former company employees to get insider information analysts for global trade research firm smartkarma wrote in an e book titled the end of fair trade released this month 2019 bloomberg finance lp the trump administration has adopted measures of its own to combat ip theft which is one way to throw a wrench in china s made in 2025 machine one measure will tighten technology exports like semiconductors and another has the u s being tougher on chinese acquisitions ant financial the financial arm of alibaba the tech firm created by billionaire jack ma was stopped from acquiring money gram last year trump also signed a bill in august that expanded the operating powers of the committee of foreign investment in the united states cfius the law makes filing with the cfius mandatory for foreign acquisitions deemed sensitive to u s interests rubio s made in china 2025 and the future of american industry report is yet another shot across the bow of china s ship of state rubio believes that china s top down development policies are a headwind for american jobs and wages from the report though made in china 2025 is a foreign actor s plan for the domination of critical commercial sectors at the expense of american industries the u s should not miss the opportunity its prominence provides claiming as the plan does that without strong manufacturing there is no national prosperity should be a wake up call for american political economy as much as a cause for scrutiny trump s last round of tariffs against china came with talk of reciprocity that means if china is charging 20 for an american made widget to enter its market the u s is not going to charge the chinese 2 for the chines made widget sold here they re going to charge the same duties an asia society task force concluded in 2017 the united states should insist on trade reciprocity in the u s china relationship even if it means raising tariffs something free market types loathe 2018 bloomberg finance lp but that s just one step in the ideological battle as the director of national intelligence called it in their threat assessment last month if washington views china s investments be they in robotics or biotech as a threat to u s corporate interests and if that threat is based on years of stolen data and unfair trade practices then leveling out tariff rates isn t enough to stop these two from butting heads in the future you can mix capitalism and communism but how do you deal with the limits of a political system that impedes the private sector from competing asks phil zhu a professor at the university of san diego look at huawei it s private but outside of its smartphone handsets who are its competitors in the 5g space huawei has all the resources that s why in the end this is not about tariffs china will agree to buy more stuff and open a new market that s an easy solution for them but they are going to protect their long term interests he says i think you can make short term compromises but over the long term these two competing political systems are much harder to reconcile

we continue to see many of the world s top marketers transform their marketing organizations to adapt to changing consumer behaviors and new disruptive competitors for omnicom change provides opportunities challenges and ample room for differentiation i m pleased to report that in this rapidly changing environment our strategies talent and execution have allowed us to continue to deliver solid financial results for the full year 2018 we achieved our internal organic growth and margin targets organic growth for the quarter was 3 2 for the full year 2018 organic growth was 2 6 our ebit margin for the quarter was 15 3 an increase of 30 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 for the year our ebit margin excluding the effect of our third quarter dispositions and repositioning actions was 13 8 an increase of 20 basis points versus the prior year eps for the fourth quarter was 1 77 per share which compares to a 1 55 per share in the prior year excluding the charge related to the us tax act that we took in the fourth quarter of 2017 an increase of 14 we achieved these goals by growing our strong base of talented people investing in technology and analytic capabilities as well as continuing to differentiate our organization structure so we can deliver custom integrated solutions that drive business growth for our clients taken together these strategic steps have helped us grow both our top and bottom line in the quarter we grew organically in every geographic region of the world with broad participation across our agencies disciplines and client sectors looking at the fourth quarter growth across disciplines advertising and media was up 4 4 crm consumer experience was up 4 2 healthcare was up 7 6 pr increased 1 5 as we expected crm execution and support was the only exception it was down 3 7 in the quarter by region the us was up 2 6 driven by solid results in media healthcare and pr the us benefited from better than expected year end project spend as well as spending related to the mid term elections crm execution and support had negative growth and weighed down the performance in the us overall growth in the uk was 2 4 media and healthcare performed very well offsetting this growth was a decline in crm execution and support particularly in field marketing overall growth in our european region was 5 7 led by france italy spain and the czech republic germany again had negative growth due to specific management and operational challenges at some of our agencies we ve taken actions to address this performance and expect to see improvements asia pacific growth slowed in the quarter to 2 9 while most of the markets in the region experienced positive results the region faced tough comps relative to the prior year lastly latin america posted growth of 1 in the quarter strong results in mexico were offset by negative growth in brazil and colombia in 2018 we remain focused on executing our plan to drive efficiencies across our organization which contributed to the increase in year over year margins this performance was a result of our agency management teams remaining laser focused on controlling their cost structure our ongoing omnicomwide operational initiatives to leverage our scale in areas such as real estate accounting and it and the benefit from the disposition of lower margin non core businesses during 2018 importantly we ve been able to improve our margins while continuing to invest in our talent and our data and our analytic capabilities turning to our cash flow in 2018 omnicom generated 1 6 billion in free cash flow and returned 1 1 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases approximately 475 million in cash was used for acquisition related spend during the year our plans for the use of free cash flow remains unchanged dividend acquisition and share repurchases as we recently announced our board of directors increased the company s quarterly cash dividend to 0 65 per common share this represents an 8 3 increase in our quarterly dividend with this increase our dividend payout ratio is 45 lastly our balance sheet and liquidity remained very strong turning now to our strategy and operations 2018 was a year of significant accomplishments for omnicom we finalized the expansion of our global client leaders group organization and our practice areas which have been aligned within our global networks we continue to realign and optimize our portfolio of agencies through acquisitions and dispositions we ve made investments in technology data and analytics and as i mentioned we continue to streamline our operations in real estate accounting and it in 2016 we began the formation of practice areas together with our global client leaders group to deliver to clients a single point of access to our network of thousands of industry specials and specific marketing disciplines with strong leadership in each of our practice areas we are now positioned to better grow with existing clients strengthen our new business efforts better target our internal investments as well as create more career opportunities for our people we began with omnicom health group and

next 10 years on the media front daimler ag awarded its global media account to omnicom media group the group will handle media for all of daimler s divisions mercedes benz cars and vans daimler trucks and buses as well as daimler financial services in 40 markets worldwide a significant part of omnicom s success is driven by our investments in technology data and analytics these investments started over a decade ago with the formation of annalect in 2018 we took another leap forward with the launch of omni a first of a kind people based precision marketing and insights platform today i m happy to report many of our agencies have deployed omni to create plan and execute personalized customer experiences at scale with some of our largest clients the platform is also transforming the way our teams work by providing a single view of their client s consumers enabling them to drive precision marketing across creative crm and media this personalization at scale is providing enormous value to our clients as important as the client wins i mentioned earlier is the way in which we achieve our success it wasn t about collapsing our agencies into one but rather investing in our agency brands and connecting them through our practice groups global client leaders and platforms like omni which allowed us to leverage our scale in an agile fluid and diverse way the growth of our business in 2018 underscores the distinctive talents of our people and the strength of our agency brands as well as our differentiated structure and service offering we know our clients today are looking for

to pursue high growth areas and opportunities through internal investments and acquisitions and we will remain vigilant on driving efficiencies throughout our organization in closing we are very pleased that our strong financial performance continues to reflect the excellence of our people and agencies and i thank everyone for their efforts i will now turn the call over to phil for a closer look at the results phil philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks john and good morning as john just described the fourth quarter results represented a strong end to omnicom s year as is essential in today s business climate our agencies remain focused on responding to our clients needs in an ever changing marketplace while at the same time they continue to manage their internal cost structures to efficiently deliver their services our business has continued to execute on both objectives we also continue to see the benefit of our companywide efforts to increase our operational efficiency regarding our revenue and starting on slide 5 for the fourth quarter we had organic growth of 3 2 or 132 million as our agencies overall did well to improve upon last year in capturing year end project spend fx again negatively impacted revenue reducing our reported revenue for the quarter by 2 or 83 million regarding acquisitions and dispositions as we spoke about during our last call we completed several dispositions during the third quarter the largest of which was sellbytel our european sales support business we also completed several acquisitions over the past year including this quarter s acquisition of the media and performance marketing division of udg a strategic digital media group in germany the net impact of our acquisition and disposition activities reduced fourth quarter revenue by about 101 million or 2 4 in line with our expectations and lastly as a reminder we were required to adopt the fasb s new revenue recognition standard known as asc 606 effective with the beginning of 2018 the impact of applying the new revenue recognition standard reduced our reported revenue by approximately 38 million or 0 9 for the quarter as a result our revenue in the fourth quarter decreased to a little under 4 1 billion when compared to q4 of last year later on i will discuss the components of the changes in revenue in more detail turning to slide 1 our operating profit for the quarter was 627 million up slightly when compared to q4 of 2017 while our operating margin of 15 3 represented a 30 basis point increase over last year s fourth quarter ebitda was 650 million and our ebitda margin of 15 9 was also up 30 basis points when compared to last year our ongoing internal initiatives to increase our operational efficiencies focusing on real estate back office services procurement and it continue to positively impact our operating income and margin performance as well as the benefits of the restructuring actions we took last quarter we also benefited from the disposition of several non strategic lower margin agencies which was partially offset by the reduction in margins caused by the negative impact of fx in the quarter net interest expense for the quarter was 53 1 million up 3 1 million versus last year s fourth quarter figure and down 3 6 million versus the 56 7 million reported in the third quarter of 2018 gross interest expense in the quarter was up 6 6 million compared to last year s q4 primarily due to the impact of increased interest rates over the past year particularly impacting our floating rate swaps while interest income increased 3 5 million due to an increase in cash held by our treasury centers when compared to a year ago when compared with q3 of this year gross interest expense in the fourth quarter decreased by 1 1 million primarily driven by the reduction in our commercial paper activity during the fourth quarter and interest income increased by 2 5 million over last year resulting from higher than average cash balances that we typically carry at year end turning to taxes our reported effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 26 1 bringing the full year tax rate to 25 6 the primary driver of the lower effective tax rate year over year was the lower us tax rate resulting from the enactment of the 2017 tax act which reduced the federal statutory tax rate 21 from 35 the effective rate for the year was slightly lower than what we previously anticipated for 2018 going forward we anticipate our effective tax rate for 2019 will be 27 which approximates our actual full year rate 2018 after excluding the following items tax impact of the repositioning actions taken in q3 the additional tax expense recorded in q3 resulting from the provisional amounts originally recorded in q4 of 2017 in connection with the tax act the successful resolution of foreign tax claims during the first quarter of 2018 and after excluding the impact of the tax benefit realized from share based compensation items particularly in q4 which we cannot predict because it is subject to changes in our share price and the impact of future stock option exercises earnings in our equity method investments was 5 3 million for the quarter upon the strength of the performance of our affiliates in asia and europe the allocation of earnings to minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased by 2 9 million to 30 5 million primarily a result of our disposition activity and the negative impact of fx since a large number of our less than fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the us as a result our net income for the fourth quarter was 399 million as a reminder in q4 last year we recorded a net increase to income tax expense 106 million related to our preliminary assessment of the impact of the passage of the 2017 tax act just before last year end although net income increased 145 million versus last year s reported net income of 254 million excluding last year s additional tax charge net income increased 39 million or 10 7 now turning to slide 2 net income available for common shareholders for the quarter was 399 million our diluted share count for q4 was 225 6 million decrease of 2 9 versus q4 of last year due to the impact of our share repurchase activity over the past 12 months as a result diluted eps for the fourth quarter was 1 77 per share that s up 0 68 versus our reported q4 2017 amount of 1 09 per share and up 0 22 or 14 2 after excluding the impact of the 106 million charge tax reform which we took in q4 of last year on slides 3 and 4 we provide the summary p l eps and other information for the full year results as a reminder in the third quarter we closed on the disposition of sellbytel along with other dispositions we completed during the third quarter that resulted in a net pre tax gain of 178 million in addition during the third quarter we recorded charges of 149 million for repositioning actions primarily resulting from severance and lease terminations lastly in q3 we recorded additional tax expense of approximately 29 million resulting from adjustments of the provisional amounts originally recorded in connection with the 2017 tax act the non gaap adjusted results on slide 22 in the supplemental section of our presentation present our full year results excluding these items since the full year results without these items are in line with our quarterly performance i will highlight just a few of them the reported operating profit for 2018 was 2 13 billion an increase of 2 4 versus last year with the resulting operating margin of 14 and finally our full year reported eps was 5 83 per share compared to 4 65 a share in 2017 excluding the impact during the third quarter of the dispositions the repositioning actions and tax reform adjustments 2018 s eps would have been 0 08 lower at 5 75 per share that s up 0 65 in comparison to 2017 s adjusted eps of 5 10 after excluding the impact of the additional 106 million in tax expense recorded in connection with the tax act at the end of 2017 returning to the details of our revenue performance in the fourth quarter on slide 5 as we discussed in detail during previous calls this year we adopted asc 606 the new revenue recognition standard and the impact of applying the new revenue recognition standard reduced our reported revenue by approximately 1 in the fourth quarter and for the full year the impact on ebit was not material because of the dollar s continued strengthening over the past several months the fx impact on our reported revenue created headwinds in the fourth quarter the impact of changes in currency rates decreased reported revenue by 2 or 83 million in revenue for the quarter and the strengthening again was widespread on a year over year basis in the fourth quarter the dollar strengthened against every one of our major foreign currencies except for the japanese yen the largest fx movements in the quarter were from the australian dollar the brazilian real the euro and the uk pound as for a projection of the fx impact for 2019 any assumption on how foreign currency rates will move over the next few months let alone the rest of the year for us is highly speculative however as we begin the year currencies stay where they currently are based on our projection fx could reduce our reported revenues by approximately 2 5 to 3 in the first half of 2019 and 1 5 for the full year the impact of our recent acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenue by 101 million in the quarter or 2 4 as we enter 2019 we expect the impact of acquisitions net of dispositions completed through year end will continue to be negative approximately 3 to 3 5 for the first half of 2019 and 2 5 for the year as we cycle through the sellbytel and other dispositions from 2018 finally while remaining somewhat mixed geographically and by discipline organic growth for the fourth quarter was up 3 2 primarily reflecting the positive effects client year end project spending geographically the us european and asia pacific regions had the strongest growth regarding our service disciplines our healthcare agency group had excellent growth this quarter as did our crm consumer experience agencies as well as our advertising discipline primarily driven by the strength of our media businesses slide 6 shows our mix of business by discipline for the second quarter the split was 57 for advertising and 43 for marketing services as for the organic growth by discipline our advertising discipline was up 4 4 media continues to pace the disciplines organic growth and while our global advertising agencies continue to experience mixed performance our national advertising agencies performed quite well this quarter crm consumer experience was up 4 2 organically with our precision marketing agencies leading the way in that category crm execution and support was down 3 7 this quarter as we again saw sluggish performance particularly domestically from certain businesses in that discipline pr was up 1 5 with the strongest performances coming from our domestic agencies which included a small year over year benefit from work associated with the mid term elections lastly healthcare was up 7 6 as has been the case recently the disciplines strong performance was broad based across all regions on slide 7 which details the regional mix of our business you can see during the quarter the split was 52 in the us 3 for the rest of north america 9 in the uk 19 for the rest of europe 11 for asia pacific 3 for latin america and the balance from the middle east and african markets turning to the details of our performance by region on slide 8 organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter in the us was 2 6 led by our advertising and media healthcare and pr agencies with our crm execution and support agencies lagging after a negative third quarter our uk businesses rebounded with positive organic growth of 2 4 led by our healthcare and media agencies the rest of europe was up 5 7 organically in the quarter in our europe markets france italy and spain continued to turn in strong performances across disciplines this quarter while germany again underperformed organic growth in europe outside the eurozone was positive as well organic growth in the asia pacific region was 2 9 with positive growth in all disciplines geographically we saw solid performances from our agencies in greater china india and new zealand this quarter and japan returned to positive growth latin america had organic growth of 1 in the quarter the ongoing macroeconomic issues in brazil continue to impact our businesses in the marketplace for the quarter they were down again at just over 1 offsetting brazil we continue to see positive performance elsewhere in the region particularly from our agencies in mexico the middle east and africa which was our smallest region was up 4 2 for the quarter turning to slide 9 we present our mix of revenue by our client s industry sector in comparing the full year revenue for 2018 to 2017 you can see there were some minor shifts in distribution of our client revenue by industry but nothing particularly noteworthy turning to our cash flow performance on slide 10 you can see that we generated 1 64 billion of free cash flow during the year including a positive effect from changes in working capital as well as the proceeds of 308 million from the disposition of businesses which primarily occurred in the third quarter as for our primary uses of cash on slide 11 dividends paid to our common shareholders were 549 million up due to the 5 increase in our quarterly dividend that was effective with the january 2018 payment partially offset by the reduction in share count year over year resulting from our repurchase activity dividends paid to our non controlling interest shareholders were 135 million up 33 million year on year capital expenditures increased 40 million to 196 million as we continue our real estate reconfiguration efforts to increase operational efficiency acquisitions including earn out payments were 477 million up 392 million due to an increase in acquisition activity in 18 as compared to the prior year and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled 568 million roughly the same as in 2017 excluding the 308 million of proceeds from our dispositions during the year we outspent our free cash flow by about 283 million this year primarily driven by our acquisition activity in 2018 turning to slide 12 regarding our capital structure at the end of the year our total debt is down 33 million over the past year at just under 4 9 billion our net debt position at the end of the year was 1 23 billion up 105 million compared to december 31st of 2017 the increase was principally due to the overspend of our free cash flow of 283 million and the negative impact of fx on our cash balances at year end which totaled approximately 200 million partially offsetting these was the positive change in operating capital of approximately 80 million and the cash proceeds received from the sale of subsidiaries during the year of 308 million as for our debt ratios they remain solid our total debt to ebitda ratio was 2 0 times and our net debt to ebitda ratio was 0 5 times both consistent with the ratios from this time last year while our interest coverage ratio was 9 9 times down a little over the past year due to the increase in interest expense it remains very strong on slide 13 you can see we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions for the last 12 months our return on invested capital ratio 29 6 while our return on equity was 51 4 as we anticipated both ratios were positively impacted this year by the lower us corporate tax rates enacted at the end of 2017 and finally on slide 15 we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10 years the line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2009 through 2018 which totaled 10 3 billion and the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and net share repurchases some of which during the same period was 10 7 billion this resulted in a cumulative payout ratio of 104 over the last decade and that concludes our prepared remarks please note that we ve included several other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review but at this point we re going to ask the operator to open the call for questions thank you questions and answers operator operator instructions we go to the line of alexia quadrani with jpmorgan please go ahead alexia quadrani jpmorgan analyst thank you operator one moment please ms quadrani go ahead alexia quadrani jpmorgan analyst thank you so much just a couple of questions if i may first i guess how should we think broadly about organic growth in 2019 and can we continue to see this improvement in the us and then just a second question really is on the crm execution business which remains weak i think you highlighted field marketing was particularly soft i guess are you planning to any other divestitures similar to the ones we saw in q3 thank you john d wren chief executive officer good morning alexia this is john in terms of organic growth at this point we are what will start tomorrow is the process of sitting down with our companies and going through their final profit plans for 2019 so at this point if i was making a prediction i d say organic growth is probably going to come in somewhere between 2 and 3 i think it s similar to what we said in the past some of the wins that we ve received to your second question of domestic growth i m optimistic some of the wins that we had in the fourth quarter of 2018 specifically ford and the us army they re not going to make too much of a contribution i don t think in the first quarter and half of this year but after that they should start to contribute rather significantly to our performance as domestically and in other parts of the world i don t know phil you want to add philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah just to clarify i think the 2 to 3 which was our internal target last year is for the year so that s where we re seeing 19 at the moment we don t have the best visibility given it s early february in terms of what the year is going to shake out to be and certainly a lot of things can change between now and the balance of the year but i think that s our current set of expectations john d wren chief executive officer i can promise you we will if we can do better we will with respect to your other question about crm execution we are constantly going through we did do a lot of disposals during the year but consistent with i think what we ve been telling the shareholders we ve been looking at our portfolio of companies and those that we don t think will contribute to our growth as we look forward where we are considering disposal we did quite a bit of work in the third quarter and earlier in the year that review constantly goes on and as we will continue to go on especially as we go through the next three or four weeks worth of profit planning for 2019 alexia quadrani jpmorgan analyst and then just a follow up if i may on your earlier comment you know i don t want to nitpick too much about organic growth in any one quarter because i know it s a small dollar amount that makes a change but just maybe a broader comment about the q4 performance you mentioned project business in q4 came through well which was a benefit for the better us organic growth in q4 but did you get a sense of sort of the underlying feel of the business also showed some improvement or am i trying to split hairs here that is too difficult to answer john d wren chief executive officer well you might be trying to split hairs a little bit as i think we ve said rather consistently i know i have for the last 20 years when we get to the fourth quarter there is a lot of activities that go on there are lot of budgets which client doesn t spend that they accelerate activities on there are lot of opportunities to sell additional products which motivates clients to do so and then there are some clients who try to hold back that spending to increase their p ls this year i think if i m remembering correctly 18 of the last 20 years the fourth quarter has come through with that project spending i think those one or two years during the great recession technical difficulty philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer last year was realistically a little bit easier of a comp than we ve had in years before because we didn t do as well frankly in picking up that project spend as we did this year alexia quadrani jpmorgan analyst thank you very much operator next we ll go to the line of craig huber with huber research partners please go ahead craig huber huber research partners analyst yes good morning i have three questions my first one just a follow on to alexia your organic outlook this year of 2 to 3 what is your preliminary thought on margins for the year flat or what are you thinking right now please john d wren chief executive officer phil and i maybe thinking differently again we haven t finished our profit planning at this point if i had to make a prediction i d say i m looking at them to be flat the primary headwind we have in margins is the strength of the us dollar we more or less predict for you what the impacts are going to be on the top line and we tell you that but we don t predict for you what the impact is going to be on the ebit line and that s always that always create some pressure so right now i d say margins should be flat philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean i wouldn t disagree i think we re certainly going to be working hard yield a different answer and yield some improvement but we do expect let s say we do expect to achieve some benefits from our continued operational efficiency efforts we do expect some improvement from a change in mix achieved by some of the dispositions we did in 18 businesses which on balance had a little bit lower margin than our average but fx in the fourth quarter which was negative 2 on revenue for the first time in quite some time did have a headwind on our margins in the fourth quarter and we expect fx certainly in the first half and for the year in 19 will likely be much more of a headwind how that will shake out our margins is tough to tell depending on where those fx movements happen craig huber huber research partners analyst and my second question is net new business wins in the fourth quarter what was that number please john d wren chief executive officer phil you know it philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it was a little over 1 1 billion craig huber huber research partners analyst okay great and then my last question your performance obviously for the last year was much better than your two large european peers although it wasn t as strong as it s been historically and i m just curious john it s been nowhere near nominal gdp growth per se what would you say john is the three biggest factors in your mind that held it back to up 2 6 for the year and maybe what your outlook is for each of those factors for this new year has anything significantly changed on each of those three thank you john d wren chief executive officer i think that the industry itself has been going through some changes in terms of the way the acceleration of digital and how that gets you rather than traditional forms of media some of the portfolio companies that we ve had which always contributed ebit especially in the areas of crm execution businesses like field marketing and other things companies like amazon and online delivery eliminated the need for the same type of activity that has happened on a retail level that s happened in the past so it s been the last i d say two years have been years of transition when we look at our portfolio when we look at the companies that we believe will contribute to our growth going forward we re looking at those factors and other changes in technology which are going to impact the services that we ve traditionally provided and so far we ve been able to do a pretty good job i think of identifying those areas and taking action on them where we can still get value where other people still have interest in those areas so i think that s way down a bit in terms of some of the growth the other thing that sitting and running a company you don t mind when your competitors are weak you really don t like it when your competitors are wounded because they tend to do things that they wouldn t do if they were simply weak and so it s been a rather competitive environment the last six months or so craig huber huber research partners analyst great thank you operator next we have a question from the line of julien roch with barclays please go ahead julien roch barclays analyst yes hi there my first question is can we have the impact of accuen on organic in q4 the second question is i feel several times you said that disposition had a positive impact on margin fx had a negative impact on margin and your cost as well had a positive impact on margin so could you break down the margin increase in 2018 between those three things and then the last question is in q3 you kind of offset your capital gain of 178 million by a provision for restructuring of 149 million well i assume that s mostly a provision how much of that provision did you use in q4 thank you philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure while i m answering the first two we need to get the answer on the third number but that will be in our 10 k filing so on the first two i think well the accuen number was 6 million growth in the fourth quarter and it basically was largely in the us on the margin front i can tell you fx in the fourth quarter was a negative headwind of about little over 20 basis points it s hard to split out and we don t what was the exact impact of our operational efficiencies and what was the exact impact of the dispositions but fx for the first time was negative in i m not sure i recall 20 basis points or so a meaningful difference but i think some of the listeners certainly are interested in that number so that was that rough estimate and then on can you just give me a minute on the restructurings on the restructuring front i think actually i m going to have to give you that offline julien because we have the number but i want to make sure i answer your question directly so we can give you some clarity on that offline julien roch barclays analyst okay sure thank you very much philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure operator next we go to line of dan salmon with bmo capital markets please go ahead daniel salmon bmo capital markets analyst good morning everyone john you ve done a ton of work over the last couple years continuing with divestitures and changing your portfolio of assets you ve done the reorganization around practice groups when we look across your base of business i m curious how do you think it rolls up into exposure by vertical by client vertical do you think about it that way at all looking to have maybe exposure to verticals with better secular growth over the long term and then just related to that is sort of maybe mix of your largest clients versus how important it is to you to engage some of the more up and coming innovator brands maybe what we call the direct to consumer brands more broadly we would love to hear some more thoughts on that and then phil just quickly m a was obviously considerably higher this year versus 2017 maybe that s you ve also outspent free cash flow would you say 2018 is more reflective of what you would consider a quote unquote normal year and that 2017 was unusually conservative and how we think about that to frame your thinking on your uses of free cash flow this year coming up thanks john d wren chief executive officer a couple of questions there i think if you look at the verticals i think it s slide 10 phil referred to it earlier kind of give you an indication of the industry sectors that we service since the formation of omnicom excuse me it s slide 9 since the formation of omnicom we ve always been focused on serving one blue chip clients two globally not concentrated in any one area or in any one industry and i think if you look at this slide plus we ve provided it in the past if you put a few of these years not only 18 and 17 together you ll see that that s been the case for quite a while that s in one instance if you take a look at our top 25 clients our matrix area covers up to 100 of our top clients now but just the top 25 it represents just some of the 4 billion of our revenue and we service them in many many areas and it s a concentration it s not a concentration of any particular industry there is tech there is auto there is pharma there is financial services it goes across the board very consistent with what s depicted on slide 9 in those areas where we ve been able to do that during the year those same clients contributed about 4 growth to our overall organic growth for the year so we are proving that as we have these practice areas number one focusing on skills and crafts the clients need plus a matrix system of practice areas where we bring everybody servicing that client together we re able to identify more quickly needs that clients have and adjust our portfolio and services as quickly as we possibly can so it s all moving again it s been going on for close to three years but we are very satisfied with the progress that we re making we think it will contribute to our progress going forward philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer on the m a question i think it s hard to say what 19 is going to be because we don t put together internal target with a dollar amount for our targeted m a spend and then set our m a folks and network heads off to find deals to meet that target end up doing deals that you otherwise probably would have been better off not doing but you might have met the target so we don t plan to change that approach i think our preference would be to do more m a similar to what we accomplished in 18 more accretive deals if they re available if they have the right strategic and cultural fit we don t want to do more than less so we prefer to do more deals like we did in 18 as opposed to a pretty low level in 17 but it s hard to predict i mean we ve got a number of them in the pipeline that we ve been working on and continue to work on some of them end up having a long cycle of discussions some of them we don t ultimately get close so it s hard to predict but we would certainly prefer to look more like what we accomplished in 18 and 17 daniel salmon bmo capital markets analyst great thank you both very helpful philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure operator next we go to the line of tim nollen with macquarie please go ahead tim nollen macquarie analyst good morning thanks i d just like just one question i d like to follow up on the outlook for 2019 if you could maybe give us a little bit of color on how clients are approaching spending this year just in general terms given some big macro issues such as possible slowdowns in china and brexit risk and so on just kind of how are clients thinking about spending this year versus other years and if it s possible to break down kind of an underlying client spending impact on the 2 to 3 versus new business flowing in please john d wren chief executive officer the clients that i ve spoken to and we ll get greater insight as we talk to some of our network heads over the course of next 10 days they are cognizant of the fact that there is a lot of change going on in the world you ve got brexit you ve got china slowing down is the fed going to raise interest rates is it going to stay on hold there has been quite a number of factors having said that i believe i m speaking for most of our clients and they know that they re in the business of selling products and growing their top lines so they re going to continue to do whatever activities are necessary to accomplish those tasks so there s no fear i don t get a sense of fear i don t get a sense of is this going to be you know everything is fine and there are no geopolitical or other risks out there it s just going to be another year similar to the ones we ve had in i think the last two and your second question i think i missed tim nollen macquarie analyst yeah if you could just help us understand how much of the 2 to 3 preliminary outlook is just underlying client ongoing spending versus inflow of new business because you had some nice wins toward the end of the year john d wren chief executive officer yeah you know at this point of the year we don t calculate that typically what makes up our organic growth is growth from existing clients new business wins and losses that we might have it s been net of those philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it isn t a single number and it isn t that easy to kind of capture it from a definition perspective it might down pretty straightforward and simple but when you collect the data at the detail level and roll it up that there s quite a bit of judgment in terms of how those things fall into each of those buckets so we don t have that kind of information readily available at this point tim nollen macquarie analyst okay sure thanks a lot philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer i think the market is about to open we have time for one more call operator operator okay it s the line of jason bazinet with citi please go ahead jason bazinet citi analyst i just had a quick question you were very kind to talk about the headwind next year acquisitions and net of dispositions on the topline and talked about those disposed assets also having lower margins i just wondered if the disposed assets also had slower growth and might sort of help your organic growth or maybe indeed they were faster growing it might be a headwind but any color on the impact to your organic growth would be helpful from the dispositions john d wren chief executive officer personally i m not anticipating it having a significant statistically measurable type of impact on our overall performance in terms of organic growth what we were doing the reason we got a value i think for the companies that we did dispose of was because of we were projecting out several years and saying that unless we became tremendously larger in these particular areas we probably wouldn t be able to sustain the growth that we had and so therefore we made a decision that somebody else could do a better job with those assets and that s why we got rid of them so i don t have that calculation for you philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think we did that calculation in q3 but it s not one that we ve kind of baked into our internal processes and systems because we typically try not to carve out all the bad stuff leaving all the good stuff but i think it s safe to say that as a portfolio as we look at 19 the businesses we disposed of in 18 were not growing faster than our overall organic growth profile in 2018 for the rest of the business exactly how much from a dollars or percentage perspective by quarter we don t think the numbers are going to be that meaningful and we don t have them at hand jason bazinet citi analyst okay very helpful thank you very much philip j angelastro executive vice president and chief financial officer sure okay well thank you everybody for joining the call and we ll talk to you again soon operator ladies and gentlemen that

president and chief executive officer thank you grace and welcome to all of you joining this review of our 2018 results for the fourth quarter and full year our chief administration officer and interim cfo trish maxson is also with us and she will discuss details of our financial results in a few minutes let me start by summarizing our performance we had a record quarter and full year the product of outstanding performance particularly in our leasing business corporate solutions and at lasalle revenue and fee revenue both achieved record levels increasing 13 in us dollars for the quarter and full year revenue totaled 4 9 billion for the quarter and 16 3 billion for the full year fee revenue reached 2 1 billion for the quarter and 6 5 billion for the year we produced strong diversified growth in real estate services led by leasing with revenues up 16 year on year compared with a 5 increase for the market as a whole within corporate solutions the tremendous effort and focus to accelerate top line growth and more importantly expand margins reflects strong progress and continued momentum on top of our record performance in our real estate services business lasalle also had an exceptional year and earned record incentive fees of 216 million adjusted net income reached 276 million for the quarter up from 208 million and 563 million for the year compared with 426 million in 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share were 5 99 per share for the quarter up from 4 53 a year ago for the full year adjusted diluted earnings per share reached 12 25 compared with 9 31 in 2017 adjusted ebitda totaled 418 million for the quarter increasing from 331 million last year and 953 million for the full year compared with 771 million in 2017 we are especially proud that next to all the financial and operating success achieved in 2018 we have also made substantial progress with our beyond strategy and platform transformation efforts to put these results in context global economic growth is estimated to have been 3 7 last year roughly in line with 2017 contributing to another year of positive real estate fundamentals global real estate transaction volumes were up 4 for the full year totaling 773 billion the highest level since 2007 capital values for prime assets in 30 major office markets grew at an annualized rate of 5 5 european cities were the top performer globally notably amsterdam up 33 madrid up 18 and berlin up 13 annualized rental growth for prime offices across 30 markets remained steady with full year 2018 registering growth of 3 8 global office leasing markets exceeded expectations over the past year totaling nearly 463 million square feet 5 higher than in 2017 in the fourth quarter however global volumes were down 6 compared with the year ago at the same time global vacancy rate declined to a cyclically low of 11 3 any growth in prime rental growth equaled the 2017 rate of 3 8 in this environment our overall growth was almost completely organic with our real estate services business leading the way producing record fee revenue of approximately 6 billion growth was led by leasing corporate solutions and project and development services despite a slight decline in our overall capital markets revenue real estate services achieved double digit revenue growth and margin expansion as i noted earlier lasalle produced significant revenue growth reflecting record incentive fees and increased advisory fees for details see slide 13 in the supplemental slides document so taken together we had a very strong year proof of the collective power and diversity of our services and the breadth of our global platform now let s turn to trish for detailed comments on our performance in the quarter and for the full year trish maxson chief administrative officer and interim chief financial officer thank you christian it s a pleasure to report the details of such a strong finish to 2018 our fourth quarter exceeded expectations and significantly contributed to the record full year results as christian noted we grew revenue by double digit for both the quarter and the year on a local currency basis consolidated revenue and fee revenue increased 15 and 16 respectively compared to fourth quarter 2017 and on a full year basis revenue grew 13 all segments achieved growth in revenue and nearly all of that was organic for the year total organic growth was stronger compared to organic growth achieved in 2017 the increase was primarily driven by strong performance in leasing corporate solutions and lasalle incentive fees consolidated adjusted ebitda margin expanded by 130 basis points despite reduced capital markets revenues and continued platform and technology investments a reminder as we turn to service line and segment results we report percentage changes in local currency except for capital markets which aligns with us dollar denominated research data consolidated leasing fee revenue grew at a very impressive 27 for the quarter the outcome of outstanding performance across our real estate services segments this was exceptional considering the 7 decline in global market gross absorption year to date leasing fee revenue grew 15 also outpacing the modest 5 increase in full year gross absorption all geographic segments experienced growth most notably the americas our consolidated capital markets fee revenue declined 12 against fourth quarter 2017 primarily the result of reduced investment sales in emea and asia pacific on a full year basis capital markets fee revenue declined by 1 against the 4 increase in global investment sales our year on year underperformance against the market is attributable to our outsized growth in the prior year in 2017 we benefited from investments in the americas capital markets debt business the stellar uk rebound in transactions and sizable deals across all geographies all of which led to double digit growth against 2017 property and facility management fee revenue grew 17 for the quarter and 10 for the year project and development services grew 15 for both the quarter and the year while advisory and consulting grew 13 for the quarter and 12 for the year corporate solutions drove the double digit revenue growth across all geographies aided by the stabilization of integral and growth in our tetris fit out business in emea turning to margins on an as reported basis adjusted ebitda margin calculated on a fee revenue basis was 19 7 for the quarter and 14 7 for the year this represents margin expansion of 200 basis points and 130 basis points respectively margin expansion for both the quarter and year was primarily driven by organic growth in real estate services the broad based impact of growth in leasing profitable growth in corporate solutions and the stabilization of integral more than offset the headwind of lower capital markets revenue our positive operating performance allowed for continued strategic investments in technology and our global platform please see slide 7 of the supplemental materials for ebitda margin details for the full year and fourth quarter in 2018 we continued investing in both client facing tools and internal platform enhancements for the quarter and full year approximately 75 of the additional investment spend was related to technology investments as previously mentioned the financial system upgrade in emea and asia pacific is scheduled for implementation in 2019 turning now to debt management total net debt was 289 million at quarter end reflecting a decrease of 454 million from the third quarter and a decrease of nearly 300 million from fourth quarter 2017 the decreases reflect continued strong cash generation and our ongoing ability to improve our net debt position compared to fourth quarter 2017 net debt to adjusted ebitda declined from 0 8x to 0 3x in 2018 for the year cash flow from operations was approximately 600 million representing a 110 of adjusted net income from an m and a standpoint in the fourth quarter we did close the acquisition of aviva investors real estate multi manager business and assumed full ownership of the management of the encore plus fund more recently we announced the majority acquisition of latitude a us based commercial real estate lender both acquisitions will contribute to lasalle s assets under management and advisory fees in 2019 in corporate solutions we closed on value d consulting a leading provider of ibm integration and consulting services we continue to be active and opportunistic in considering acquisitions while keeping our disciplined focus on completing transactions that meet both our strategic and cultural fit and drive strong operating performance our m and a strategy remains focused on growing our capital markets corporate solutions and lasalle businesses from an investment standpoint we continue to identify and deliver new technology driven real estate service offerings through the creation of new products strategic investments and the incubation of proptech start ups through jll spark earlier in 2018 we announced the acquisition of stessa which provides technology based services for property investors in addition since the announcement of the jll global venture fund earlier this year the spark team has made nine investments focused on expanding innovative and cutting edge digital solutions for our clients the core part of our beyond strategic vision moving to segment results fourth quarter fee revenue in the americas increased 23 over fourth quarter 2017 and was up 14 for the year growth was broad based across all services with exceptional performance in leasing and corporate solutions for the quarter leasing fee revenue grew by 35 over the prior quarter and 17 for the year the regions significantly outperformed the quarter s market gross absorption we executed larger than average deals in the fourth quarter with substantial revenue growth in the new york midwest and northwest markets capital markets fee revenue was up 5 for the quarter and up 7 for the year for the quarter investment sales were nearly flat while all other services such as multifamily origination and debt servicing revenues were up 13 property and facility management fee revenue grew 12 for the quarter and 13 for the year project and development services grew 13 for the quarter and 9 for the year advisory and consulting businesses grew 24 for the quarter and 27 for the year the significant growth of all three service lines was largely due to corporate solutions new contract awards and expansion of services for existing clients americas adjusted ebitda margin calculated on a fee revenue basis was 19 3 for the quarter and 16 3 for the year an increase of 180 basis points for the quarter and a 110 basis points for the year on an as reported basis for the quarter taking into account an approximately 120 basis point tailwind from the impact of asc 606 margin expanded by 60 basis points on a like for like basis the margin improvement was driven by growth in leasing accretive new wins in outsourcing and strong operating performance partially offset by continued platform investments turning to emea total fee revenue for the quarter grew 5 over fourth quarter 2017 and was up 7 for the full year growth was led by project and development services property and facility management and advisory and consulting services emea leasing fee revenue was up 7 for both the quarter and year the performance outpaced market gross absorption across france uk and germany as well as other countries in the region in france we are seeing significant payback from our nxt technology which has improved the clients experience shortened the time required by clients to locate space and increased broker productivity we ve seen market share gains in paris and are focused on expanding the technology across other markets visit jll com for a video tour of the proptech tool emea capital markets fee revenue was down 13 for the fourth quarter and down 2 for the year less than the decline in market investment sales in the quarter we did see market outperformance in various countries including portugal and italy we also outpaced volumes in down markets including france germany and the uk emea property and facility management fee revenue increased by 23 for the quarter and 11 for the year project and development services fee revenue was up 13 for the quarter and up 22 for the year driven by contributions from mena and our tetris fit out business advisory and consulting increased 13 for the quarter and 6 for the year emea adjusted ebitda margin calculated on a fee revenue basis was 18 2 for the quarter and 7 7 for the year an increase of 370 basis points for the quarter and 140 basis points for the year on an as reported basis stabilization of integral and reduced bad debt provisions drove margin improvement in the quarter and full year moving to asia pacific fee revenue increased 3 over fourth quarter 2017 and 6 for the year growth for the quarter and full year was led by organic growth in property and facility management and leasing and was partially offset by a decline in capital markets revenue capital markets fee revenue declined 38 for the quarter and 20 for the year against 2017 the decline is largely due to prior year outsized performance driven by a handful of large transactions growth of nearly 50 in fourth quarter 2017 against fourth quarter 2016 created a difficult comparable leasing fee revenue for the fourth quarter grew 16 over 2017 and 18 for the year reflecting record performance for the quarter due to an increase in deals and increased productivity from new hires growth was driven by australia china hong kong and india property and facility management fee revenue increased 19 for the quarter and 7 for the year for the quarter corporate solutions benefited from a strong win rate and growth in existing clients project and development services fee revenue was up 24 for the quarter and 20 for the year we had a strong finish to the year as large projects reached completion advisory and consulting growth of 4 for the quarter and 6 for the year was driven by corporate solutions clients asia pacific adjusted ebitda margin calculated on a fee revenue basis was 21 3 for the quarter and 13 2 for the year an increase of 70 basis points for the quarter and a decline of 90 basis points for the year on an as reported basis for the quarter after taking into account an approximate 20 basis point tailwind from the impact of asc 606 margin expanded by 50 basis points on a like for like basis for the quarter the margin expansion was largely attributable to organic growth in leasing corporate solutions and the benefits from cost saving initiatives these combined to more than offset the margin pressure from lower capital markets revenues for the full year contract losses mentioned previously and incremental platform investments led to margin contraction moving to our investment management business lasalle fee revenue growth for the quarter was 69 and 52 for the year lasalle s fourth quarter and full year results reflect strong performance driven by outstanding incentive fees predominantly from asset dispositions in asia 70 million of incentive fees for the quarter and 216 million for the year drove approximately 90 of the revenue equity earnings for the quarter were 5 4 million and 30 million for the year and result of net valuation increases in sale gains on legacy investments lasalle adjusted ebitda margin calculated on a fee revenue basis was 25 for the quarter and 31 7 for the year on an as reported basis adjusted ebitda margin expanded by 140 basis points on a local currency basis compared to full year 2017 this was primarily the result of incentive fee growth and margin expansion on private equity annuity fees and was slightly offset by decreased equity earnings for the quarter margin contracted by 420 points on a local currency basis primarily as a result of a decline in equity earnings for the period and the timing of operating expenses for the year lasalle raised 6 1 billion in new capital with 2 billion raised in the fourth quarter excluding recent acquisitions we ended the year with record level assets under management of 60 5 billion for 2019 we expect incentive fees to normalize and have modest expectations for equity earnings reflecting a moderation in asset sales and valuation increases lastly in fourth quarter 2018 we reported an incremental income tax expense of 47 million as a result of truing up the 2017 provision estimate relating to us tax legislation changes the 2018 impact to diluted earnings per share was 1 02 with no impact to adjusted diluted earnings per share i ll now turn the call back to christian for final remarks christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer thank you trish slide 19 lists a few of our recent wins across service lines and geographies our corporate solutions business maintained its win rate momentum in 2018 winning 145 new assignments expanding existing relationships with another 78 clients and renewing 52 contracts these 275 wins totaled 570 million square feet across all regions for the year we achieved a 69 win rate or new business expansions and renewals the one highlight merck a leading global healthcare company retained us for integrated facility management services at 125 locations in 63 countries around the world representative wins in capital markets included in the us the 400 million sale of the hammes medical office portfolio a diverse group of 23 class a outpatient properties in nine states totaling nearly 1 million square feet of space in poland we advised unibail rodamco on the sale of the 484 000 square foot lumen and skylight office buildings for eur190 million and in australia we represented blackstone in the sale of melbourne s waverley gardens shopping center for aud178 million in leasing and management activity in india we represented wpp marketing communications to consolidate more than 15 business groups into 256 000 square feet in a single facility in mumbai in texas we represented hewlett packard enterprise in 568 000 square foot lease at two buildings in springwoods village in houston and in poland we represented rhenus a leading provider of logistics services to lease 441 000 square feet of warehouse space near warsaw at lasalle assets under management totaled 60 5 billion at year end as trish mentioned in her remarks in november lasalle completed the acquisition of aviva s multi manager business with 6 billion in assets under management to create a new business line lasalle global partner solutions and in january lasalle closed the majority acquisition of the 1 2 billion debt fund business of latitude management real estate investors since lasalle assets under management totals are reported one quarter in arrears the 60 5 billion figure does not include assets under management from either acquisition moving to market outlook undoubtedly post the political uncertainties in the world and therefore the global outlook are becoming increasingly difficult to predict the current forecast for 2019 shows a global gdp growing 3 4 compared with the 3 7 last year there were some signs in the fourth quarter that demand is softening at the same time still growing rate of capital continues to target real estate and occupier fundamentals remain robust our research indicates investment activity to slow by no more than 5 to 10 in 2019 which still represents a healthy level of activity consistent with the last few years an increase in new office supply for this year could translate into slightly higher vacancy rates however the added supply will provide a broader range of choices for occupiers and thereby support another year of strong leasing activity at levels similar to 2018 we remain confident about our ability to keep growing our business in this environment we see tremendous momentum particularly in the americas if we look at fourth quarter gdp driven revenue for leasing and project development services in the region we see that our own growth accelerated during the fourth quarter to levels considerably higher for the quarter than for the full year and we are working proactively to maintain renewed growth in emea and asia pacific in asia we strengthened our teams in china and japan with notable hires which we expect to benefit from in 2019 we continue to transform our platform delivering ahead of plan on our beyond strategy and particularly our corporate solutions business continues to make great strides with strong pipeline and drive toward further margin expansion adding to that we are making great progress with our focus on offering our clients industry leading digital services as we gain more momentum we expect our digital services and products to contribute over 100 million in direct revenues reinforcing another important pillar of our beyond strategy consistent with our 2025 long term growth targets in 2019 we expect 6 to 8 organic fee revenue growth in our real estate services business and we have lifted our long term consolidated adjusted ebitda margin profile target to 12 5 to 14 5 to close our prepared remarks on this call we always mention just a few of the many awards and honors that our people have earned forbes named us one of the best companies for diversity fortune honored us as one of the world s most admired companies in ireland we were recognized as commercial agency of the year for 2018 our hotels and hospitality group won 2018 transactions of the year honors at the american lodging investment summit for its advisory work on the sale of waldorf astoria las vegas and lasalle was named 2018s best place to work in money management by pension and investments congratulations to everyone at jll and lasalle who made these and other awards possible and thanks to all our people around the world for continuing to serve our clients and our firm so well now let s take your questions operator could you please explain the process questions and answers operator certainly operator instructions your first question comes from mitch germain with jmp securities your line is open mitch germain jmp securities analyst good morning christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer good morning mitch mitch germain jmp securities analyst nice quarter christian two years in change into your tenure and i remember you established some strategic framework for what you wanted to accomplish how do you stand in terms of what has been done at the company and what should we expect for the next few years christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer 2018 was an exceptional year for us because we really made a lot of progress in that change program more than we had hoped for at the beginning of the year obviously we are very much supported by that strong economic environment we are operating as a company and we go with a lot of headwind into 2019 and we will continue to drive those changes i think change will be a common pattern for every corporate in this world and so we should take it as a normal course of doing business that you have to constantly transform and adapt your operations mitch germain jmp securities analyst great thank you i know christian you mentioned pipelines corporate solutions were strong but i m curious about the transaction business 4q being highly volatile particularly here in the us did that impact the growth of your pipelines in the transaction business as we enter 2019 christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well i mean the us is very very strong and we started the year with a strong backlog into the first quarter in the us and europe the situation is a bit more muted obviously that whole debate around brexit has an impact although i have to say that our uk business in the fourth quarter did really well and they also had a pretty good start into the first quarter now but overall we can t dismiss that brexit has an impact on mood in asia pacific the situation was more within jll we had some challenges we had to deal with in our transaction business especially around the capital markets front and but we have sorted that out and we are starting the year with a much much stronger team than we had during the course of last year so we are fairly optimistic for that piece of the business in our asia pacific business for 2019 mitch germain jmp securities analyst great last one from me i know you guys had referenced capital markets being influenced by some tough comps from the prior year here in 2018 i m curious the success that you had in leasing and how should we think about potentially the comps as we head into 2019 christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well leasing was a very strong year in 2018 but frankly speaking we don t expect anything else from 2019 we have built just a really really strong platform with a great team which are delivering outstanding services and the momentum into 2019 is brilliant and on the capital markets side we did some great hires also in the us you know we took over a very large team in new york and so our outlook for 2019 is pretty irrespective of the market outlook very optimistic mitch germain jmp securities analyst thank you operator your next question comes from anthony paolone with jp morgan your line is open anthony paolone jp morgan analyst thank you and nice quarter first i just wanted to clarify something christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer good morning anthony anthony paolone jp morgan analyst hi christian i want to make sure i caught your comments toward the end of your remarks properly the 6 to 8 organic fee revenue growth was that for 2019 i missed the time frame that you put on christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer yes that was for 2019 anthony paolone jp morgan analyst okay great christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer in our real estate services business anthony paolone jp morgan analyst okay got it ok and then so just on leasing as we go into 2019 you mentioned a fairly constant backdrop and i think the commentary was 5 gross absorption and you all were able to grow i think 15 and so that s quite a bit of market share pickup i mean how do you think about the ability to continue to gain that much share as we look into 2019 christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer while we have been picking up a lot of market share over the last couple of years continuously and frankly speaking at the moment we believe that we still have headroom to continue to do so we don t see any reason for any pause coming to us as i said to mitch already we have built a very very strong platform and that starts kind of to reinvigorate itself all the time when you have great people working for you other great people want to join and that creates a very strong momentum anthony paolone jp morgan analyst okay and then i guess same thing on capital markets following up on i think some of the comments from mitch do you think that recruiting in market share is enough to produce growth in what you laid out as being a bit of a shrinking backdrop for 19 christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well i mean you can either recruit and grow market share or you can do m and a we are looking at all ways of growing our business in our capital markets services as you know this is one of our strategic growth areas which we have pointed out at investor day and we are working on that topic anthony paolone jp morgan analyst okay with 0 3x net debt and an appetite to do strategic m and a what does that pipeline look like is it better or worse than it was three to six months ago christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well there s a lot of availability in the market at the moment to do m and a but one very important factor is that you keep your discipline on capital allocation and whether we have low debt or higher debt levels we always keep the same discipline here and so that s what we are doing anthony paolone jp morgan analyst okay and then last question for me i think if i look at your margin build up year over year and i look at what you spent on technology and other investments that impacted margins it seems like the dollar figure is something in the 60 million or so mark 60 million or so range how do you think that looks in 2019 i guess is one part of the question and then the other is what is that as a growth rate percentage particularly as we think about technology spending like this in up 2 number 10 number i mean how are those expenses growing christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well first and foremost we have been very transparent around our journey up to 2025 we started off with the margin profile between 12 and 14 as an adjusted ebitda margin and in that range depending on what the market allows us to do we are investing heavily into our organization and technology and going digital is a big chunk of it and we have as we called out here raised our margin profile now to 12 5 to 14 5 because we are starting to see benefits coming in from all that investment so that we can continue that investment path and at the same time increase our margin profile and that s how you should think for 2019 and going forward we have laid out a journey to 2025 what we want to do with the company and with the margin profile of the company and as we move forward we will continue to increase that and at the same time continue to invest in the platform and especially into the technology anthony paolone jp morgan analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from jade rahmani with kbw your line is open jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst thanks very much i was wondering if you could give some color on the expectation for 5 to 10 decline in investment activity in the market for example can you give any color on whether you saw any volatility in december and even january perhaps relative to typical seasonality or your expectations christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well in december there was a bit more volatility in the market because our markets are also influenced by overall sentiment and if you know the public markets in december were pretty volatile and that drives into our world as well january has started pretty strongly as the public markets have improved in january so though i don t want to make a connection which is too close between the public market and our markets business base there is a slight correlation there with regard to the outlook for 2019 the 5 to 10 this is the number which our researchers have come up with and we always should keep in mind that we are currently trading at a very high volume level this is true for leasing and for capital markets so when i see those numbers which predict a 5 to 10 decline frankly that is not at all concerning to me because it s a decline from a very very high level and then with regard to capital markets specifically for jll as you know our market share and capital markets in the us is still not where we want it to be so this 5 to 10 wouldn t be an excuse for us for not growing our business jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst and just to stay on the market for another moment in terms of bid list on transactions are you seeing any changes of note are you seeing any decline in the number of bidders or perhaps concentrations in pricing perhaps at the lower end christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well this is not as straightforward you know sometimes you see a little bit of a decrease in the bidder queue on building and then you have another product in the market of one of a sudden they all going for that product again and you have a very strong bidding list overall there still a lot of capital which is trying to get into the real estate market as you know overall we are at new record levels of capital which is sitting up the sideline which wants to get into the real estate market so i think the fundamental underlying trend is still very very strong and as i said we had a bit of a volatility in december but as we have seen now january coming in at the moment it is going back to normal and that may also be influenced that obviously the expectations around interest rates in the us have slightly changed with regard to the amount of increase we will see 19 jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst in terms of target market share for the us capital markets i agree that s really large opportunity for jll is that going to be executed based on strategic m and a or more strategic hiring christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well for the time being we do a lot of strategic hiring and if we have an opportunity for strategic m and a we would be very happy to do so but as i said before only if we can stick to our principles around really disciplined capital allocation jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst and what s the target in terms of market share i think right now you probably ranked six or so christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer yeah we don t have a target in itself usually in areas like capital markets and leasing we want to be number one or number two in any market in the world which we have as our strategic markets now we are far off in the us so we have still a long way to go and we are working on it just stay tuned with us on that jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst and in terms of operating leverage in the us capital markets business it is quite significant because of the number of leasing offices that you already have opened can you can you higher capital markets brokers and put them in those same offices or do you need to make any fixed cost investment christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer i mean we have a very strong office footprint in the us so we don t need to open any further offices over and above the existing ones so on that end we can use our existing platform the challenge is that you have to find talent with the right values with the right culture and with that kind of clear discipline to try to get to an outstanding result for the clients and if we can identify those type of people and get them into the organization then that is a good outcome for us jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst in terms of the dramatic growth that we have been seeing particularly the second half of 2018 how much of it is driven by co working and how much is also driven by the technology sector more broadly and finally how much is driven by new construction completions christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well clearly i can say for us that the flex space companies as we would call them have become important client base for us and so quite a significant proportion of that additional growth is coming from them and the other piece you already pointed it out the technology sector we have a high market share in the technology sector and they have been very active in the market and that was another part of our growth but we are focusing also on other industries which are doing really well i mean what you see is that despite all the talk about a potential decline in the economy the successful companies are doing really well and we tend to have a very strong client base among those companies and so with that we are also able to have that strong growth as we have shown in 2018 jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst can you comment on the trends you re seeing in the apac segment particularly with respect to concerns about china s growth slowing christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer i m not quite sure whether i understood the first part of your sentence what was the first part of your sentence jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst what s your view regarding the overall macro environment in the apac segment christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer okay jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst and specifically with respect to concerns about china s growth slowing christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well i mean there are a lot of smart people who are analyzing the growth of china what we can see so far is that we still have a very healthy business we added a significant amount of employees into our china business and they are very busy i think there is for our industry still a tremendous room to grow because chinese companies are professionalizing they have they also have high ambitions on the corporate real estate and the way they want to place their people in offices and so there s a tremendous amount of services which we can deliver if anything slows us down on china it s the lack of talent and we employ currently around 16 000 people in china and we would be very happy to employ more if we could just find them and so far we haven t seen any impact from that discussions around china slowing down or the trade discussions between us and china but you know if that is going to come into play going forward we may see something but so far so good i would say jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst okay turning to the lasalle segment the fee revenue performance in the fourth quarter dramatically exceeded our projections but adjusted ebitda was close to what we modeled so i m wondering if in the expense lines whether there was an increase driven by the acquisitions you completed in that segment or whether there is any market to market impact within the securities business christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well it is partly driven by the fact that we had lower equity earnings and that is driving that result in a different way than you might have expected it i mean there s also some timing with regard to expenses which have come into the fourth quarter and so going forward i mean as much as we obviously like those outsized incentive fees but going forward lasalle s business will be much more normal again in its performance so we are on a trajectory to increase our margin on the underlying annuity income and we have made great progress over the last couple of years and that will continue but we will see obviously less incentive fees in 2019 than we had in 2018 jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst thanks for taking the questions christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer sure operator your next question comes from david ridley lane with bank of america merrill lynch your line is open david ridley lane bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you wondering if you could provide a little more color on the real estate services margins in 2019 i know that integral has stabilized do you have a sense of how much of a margin drag that was in 2018 that won t now be repeating in 2019 christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well i can give you a high level answer we made tremendous progress on our real estate services margin from 17 to 18 about 80 basis points and we are pretty optimistic that we will continue to make progress on that in 2019 i can t give you the detail how much of that will be driven by a further improvement of integral frankly speaking i mean as much as it is an important investment in europe for the overall company the impact is not that strong that we would have that percentage at hand whether that how much of that progress will be driven by integral david ridley lane bank of america merrill lynch analyst understood and then i ll ask on the european technology spending question sort of a slightly different way i know you ve already been asked that but is that an incremental drag to margins in 2019 christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer you said european technology spending david ridley lane bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer sorry i m an european you mean erp ph i will leave the question to trish trish maxson chief administrative officer and interim chief financial officer yeah so this year it was about it was about half of our technology drag for 2018 and so looking into 2019 we do need to complete the emea and asia pacific implementation for peoplesoft that actually will continue to be a spend for us we don t anticipate that it s a tremendous increase over 2018 but we still may have some expenses that come in for that because we do as i said we are completing that implementation in 2019 david ridley lane bank of america merrill lynch analyst and then last one really quickly for me when you say you expect lasalle incentive fees to normalize can you remind all the all of us the level you expect or the level you would characterize as normal for incentive fees and transaction fees trish maxson chief administrative officer and interim chief financial officer yeah so for i mentioned this earlier we expect the lasalle incentive fees to come somewhere in the range of 30 to 50 that s a little bit lower than what you might think of as normal though that s difficult to really define given the volatility david ridley lane bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right thank you very much operator your next question comes from stephen sheldon with william blair your line is open stephen sheldon william blair and co analyst good morning thank you so you ve given some commentary on tax spending but just looking for a little more detail i think you ve been spending close to 8 fee revenue on both base it costs and strategic tech investments so i guess would you expect that to continue in 2019 and more of the composition between those two categories base it and strategic look much different i guess specifically are you seeing leverage in base it costs that will allow you to invest more on the strategic tech side this year christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer exactly that s what we are working for and that s what s happening we have made tremendous progress over the last couple of years on what you call base it cost infrastructure and we are making strides in pushing that down as a percentage to revenue and at the same time we are increasing our investment in client facing applications and that will continue to do so i mean we are targeting a spend which is where 8 is at the higher end of what you mentioned 8 but within that percentage spend the client application piece is going up and the infrastructure base it piece is going down stephen sheldon william blair and co analyst got it that s helpful and then you talked about hiring in china and japan that should help trends in 2019 and asia pacific can you provide some detail on which service lines you ve been hiring christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer in china specifically around capital markets the broader kind of transaction services we have a very very strong facility management and property management business there and we are we continue to build more the transactional side of services in japan it is across the board but again predominantly on the leasing and capital markets side we still have a long way to grow in japan considering the overall gdp of japan the size of the economy our business can continue to grow for many many years at the same rate as it has been stephen sheldon william blair and co analyst got it and then last one from me i guess just any update on the cfo search christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well i have a great cfo sitting next to me and she s smiling at me so that s a good start no we are working on it and we are making good progress i would say but again it s quite similar to the discipline we are having around capital allocations we are keeping our discipline here to find the person which is ideally the perfect fit for us we are under no pressure to doing it because we are a great team as we are currently but we are still working on it unfortunately trish will not continue as our cfo going forward stephen sheldon william blair and co analyst all right thank you i appreciate it operator your next question comes from marc riddick with sidoti your line is open marc riddick sidoti and company analyst hi good morning christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer hi marc marc riddick sidoti and company analyst hi good morning so several of my questions were actually answered on some of the prior questions but i did want to follow up a little bit on the acquisition marketplace i suppose and just wanted to get your general sense i mean i can understand the commentary around keeping your discipline and what you re looking for but i guess wanted to get maybe just sort of a high level view on kind of what you see is available out there and how you feel about the current and multiples of things that might be attractive to you thank you christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well at least in my career i have never seen a market which has so many availabilities with regards to m and a as it currently has i think that s probably quite normal we are on a late cycle moment and a long upturn swing and so a lot of companies are currently interested in finding a new home and so we have quite a lot of work going on and analyzing the different opportunities but we have been pretty clear which areas are of interest to us at our investor day and that hasn t really changed with regard to multiple great companies are expecting a strong multiple and less than great companies we are not interested in and so that s the obvious squeeze on the one hand you don t want to overpay on the other hand you only want to buy really outstanding companies who are a good fit for jll marc riddick sidoti and company analyst okay and then one thing i did want to circle back on is and i appreciate the commentary around the it spending and the commentary around the erp needs going into 19 i was wondering if there is any particular concentration of spend that we should be thinking about or how it might flow through the year to sort of be prepared for it thank you christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well as we said i mean trish just alluded to it we are finishing up our erp platform on the finance side in emea and apac we already finished on the hr side so that is one area of concentration still and then with regard to client applications we have given now for the first time a bit of information around the revenues we are expecting from those type of client applications and we have pretty strong ambitions on that going forward and so that will continue to be a real priority for us to invest into client applications which are driving direct revenues into the organization next to those applications which are supporting kind of existing revenue streams which we have like the nxt trish mentioned marc riddick sidoti and company analyst great thank you very much operator your next question comes from jade rahmani with kbw your line is open jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst thanks very much on the strategic m and a side do you see any compelling rationale for mergers between the public companies in the commercial real estate services sector christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well whether those companies are public on or whether they are not public doesn t really make a difference for us the question is whether they are great fit for us and so on that end that isn t anything which would bother us whether they are public or whether they re not public i think your question goes more directly to the question is it does it make sense to kind of merge with a company which provides exactly the same services or whether you are complementing you services and both can drive value obviously complementing is an easier one to say yes to but also doing something which is offering the same type of services makes sense if it offers you a scale in a way which really then helps you to drive your costs down and strengthening your market position we have done that only once to my knowledge of size and that was in 2011 when we did in the uk king sturge king sturge was doing exactly what we were doing in the uk they were pretty much exactly the same size and it really boosted our uk business at that time and it was a great decision doing it but that happens relatively rarely that you have those type of opportunities which makes sense and drive value for your shareholders jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst thanks very much operator there are no further questions at this time i ll now turn the call back over to management for closing comments christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well thank you with no further questions we close today s call thank you for participating and we look forward to speaking with you again following the first quarter operator ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the

record financial performance in 2018 can be best summarized as challenges faced and challenges met we produced record results for the seventh consecutive year and concluded 2018 with the best heritage safety performance in our company s history these accomplishments demonstrate our commitment to operational excellence and the successful execution of our strategic plan full year revenues increased 7 percent to a record 4 2 billion and adjusted ebitda e arnings b efore i nterest t axes and d epreciation and a mortization increased 9 percent to an all time high of 1 1 billion driven by a modest improvement in heritage building materials shipments solid pricing gains and value enhancing acquisitions we also delivered record net earnings and earnings per diluted share after adjusting for the one time benefit in 2017 of the 2017 tax act on earnings metrics for the full year even more noteworthy we extended our lengthy history of record performance without meaningful shipment growth from our heritage building materials business weather contractor capacity and logistics disruptions challenged both our company and the industry throughout the year resulting in aggregates volumes on a comparable basis that remained only modestly above 2010 trough levels our proven ability to successfully manage short term external disruptions makes us highly optimistic about our business and ability to achieve both continued profitability growth and shareholder value creation in 2019 and beyond looking ahead we expect 2019 to be another record year for martin marietta the fundamentals of our business and underlying demand trends remain strong across our geographic footprint we believe the combination of continued private sector strength and the long awaited arrival of increased public sector activity in our key geographies will drive shipment pricing and profitability growth in 2019 leading employment and population growth across the sunbelt should continue to bolster private sector construction activity further after a decade of underinvestment infrastructure activity is poised for meaningful growth as evidenced by an acceleration in public lettings and contract awards in our key states of texas colorado north carolina georgia and florida these trends combined with an improved pricing outlook underscore the strength of our markets and the near term growth trajectory of our business mr nye concluded we are confident in martin marietta s outlook given our leading market positions disciplined pricing strategy and proven execution of our strategic plan for 2019 we anticipate construction growth in our key regions to outpace the nation as a whole driven by attractive employment growth population trends and favorable momentum from state departments of transportation additionally widespread customer optimism and growing contractor backlogs support increased demand for our construction materials with both the ability and capacity to meet future market demand martin marietta remains committed to world class attributes across our business including safety efficiency and operational excellence and is well positioned to deliver enhanced long

footprint and dampened construction activity during an already seasonally restricted quarter texas the company s largest state by revenues experienced its wettest october in history while several southeastern states endured extreme precipitation in the form of both rainfall and snow as well as cold temperatures these temporary disruptions adversely impacted the company s shipping and production levels as well as its cost structure extreme weather conditions particularly during periods of robust demand led to days of low production followed by days of high production as customers accelerate work when weather permits all of which results in downward pressure on the company s operating leverage aggregates fourth quarter heritage aggregates pricing improved 2 3 percent and shipments declined slightly excluding the fourth quarter 2017 shipments from the company s forsyth georgia quarry that was divested in april 2018 fourth quarter 2018 heritage aggregates volume improved 0 5 percent shipments for the mid america group heritage operations increased 1 6 percent driven by heavy industrial projects in the mideast division these gains were offset by weather related delays in several large public and private construction projects in the carolinas heritage pricing improved 2 1 percent shipments for the southeast group heritage operations as reported decreased 3 2 percent excluding fourth quarter 2017 shipments from the forsyth georgia quarry these shipments increased 1 9 percent weather hindered construction activity in georgia and florida heritage pricing improved 7 4 percent driven by strong gains in north georgia and a higher percentage of long haul shipments west group shipments declined 1 2 percent driven by texas record october rainfall as well as project delays in colorado west group pricing improved 0 5 percent reflecting robust pricing in colorado that was partially offset by product mix in texas martin marietta s fourth quarter heritage aggregates shipments by end use are as follows all comparisons are versus the prior year quarter infrastructure market aggregates shipments to the infrastructure market decreased 5 percent as large public projects in north carolina south carolina and texas were delayed by weather public construction projects once awarded are seen through to completion thus delays from weather or other factors typically serve to extend the duration of the construction cycle for the company s single largest end use market the company is encouraged by the acceleration of state lettings and contract awards in key states including texas colorado north carolina georgia and florida as state departments of transportation dots and contractors continue to address labor constraints and the broader industry benefits from further regulatory reform management remains confident that infrastructure demand will continue to improve driven by funding provided by the fixing america s surface transportation act fast act and numerous state and local transportation initiatives aggregates shipments to the infrastructure market comprised 36 percent of fourth quarter aggregates volumes for the full year the infrastructure market represented 39 percent of aggregates shipments remaining below the company s most recent ten year average of 46 percent nonresidential market aggregates shipments to the nonresidential market increased 18 percent driven by both commercial and heavy industrial construction activity the company continues to benefit from robust distribution center warehouse data center and wind turbine projects in key geographies notably the mideast division which experienced favorable weather during the quarter reported double digit volume growth as it continued to ship to the mountaineer xpress pipeline project in west virginia the nonresidential market represented 36 percent of fourth quarter aggregates shipments residential market aggregates shipments to the residential market declined 10 percent stemming from weather delays importantly florida texas colorado north carolina south carolina and georgia six of the company s key states were ranked in the top ten nationally for growth in single family housing unit starts for the trailing twelve months ended november 30 2018 the residential construction outlook across the company s geographic footprint remains positive for both single and multi family housing driven by favorable demographics job growth land availability steady interest rates and efficient permitting the residential market accounted for 21 percent of fourth quarter aggregates shipments chemrock rail market the chemrock rail market accounted for the remaining 7 percent of fourth quarter aggregates shipments volumes to this sector decreased 17 percent driven by reduced agricultural lime shipments from weather delayed corn and soybean harvests and a depressed farm economy ballast shipments declined due to lower maintenance spending by class i railroads aggregates product gross margin decreased 590 basis points to 25 3 percent reflecting higher costs for production personnel diesel rail freight and depreciation combined with a lower inventory build acquired operations shipped 4 4 million tons at selling prices that are 10 percent to 15 percent below the company s average but in line with management s expectations synergy realization has exceeded the company s expectations cement cement product revenues for the fourth quarter decreased 3 3 percent as pricing growth of 2 6 percent was offset by a 5 9 percent

5 million shares of martin marietta common stock were outstanding outlook for 2019 martin marietta is confident in its 2019 outlook the company s geographic footprint has attractive underlying market fundamentals including notable employment gains population growth and superior state fiscal health all attributes that promote steady and sustainable construction growth for the foreseeable future supported by third party forecasts martin marietta believes the current construction cycle will expand further in 2019 for each of the company s three primary construction end use markets notably infrastructure construction activity particularly for aggregates intensive highways and streets should benefit from recent accelerations in state lettings and contract awards in key martin marietta states continued fast act funding and regulatory reform allowing for reduced permitting time for large projects importantly the partial federal government shutdown did not meaningfully delay awarded contracts and construction spending as the fast act and not the federal general fund supports federal transportation programs additionally state and local initiatives that support infrastructure funding including gas tax increases bond programs and other ballot initiatives will continue to play an expanded role in public sector activity as they garner voter approval at historically high levels further third party forecasts also support increased infrastructure investment in 2019 and beyond nonresidential construction activity should increase in both the commercial and heavy industrial sectors for the next several years across many of the company s key markets both the architectural billings index and dodge momentum index suggest commercial and institutional construction activity will remain healthy throughout 2019 continued federal regulatory approvals should notably contribute to increased aggregates consumption from the next wave of large energy sector projects particularly along the gulf coast to date management has not seen a slowdown in the regulatory permitting and investing decisions for these projects despite the recent pullback in oil prices construction activity for these projects is expected to begin in earnest in 2019 and continue for several years thereafter residential construction should continue to grow while mortgage rate increases temporarily paused new residential construction now stabilized the residential market is expected to adapt and further strengthen housing starts remain below the 50 year average of 1 5 million annual starts despite notable population gains further management believes a shortage of single family housing units exists particularly for entry level homes a need the homebuilding industry is now beginning to address martin marietta s leading positions in southeastern and southwestern states offer superior opportunities for gains in single family housing driven by a multitude of factors such as affordable land lower taxes and fewer regulatory barriers continued strength in residential construction supports future infrastructure and nonresidential activity specifically aggregates

in us dollars for the quarter and full year revenue totaled 4 9 billion for the quarter and 16 3 billion for the full year fee revenue reached 2 1 billion for the quarter and 6 5 billion for the year we produced strong diversified growth in real estate services led by leasing with revenues up 16 year on year compared with a 5 increase for the market as a whole within corporate solutions the tremendous effort and focus to accelerate top line growth and more importantly expand margins reflects strong progress and continued momentum on top of our record performance in our real estate services business lasalle also had an exceptional year and earned record incentive fees of 216 million adjusted net income reached 276 million for the quarter up from 208 million and 563 million for the year compared with 426 million in 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share were 5 99 per share for the quarter up from 4 53 a year ago for the full year adjusted diluted earnings per share reached

especially proud that next to all the financial and operating success achieved in 2018 we have also made substantial progress with our beyond strategy and platform transformation efforts to put these results in context global economic growth is estimated to have been 3 7 last year roughly in line with 2017 contributing to another year of positive real estate fundamentals advertisement advertisement global real estate transaction volumes were up 4 for the full year totaling 773 billion the highest level since 2007 capital values for prime assets in 30 major office markets grew at an annualized rate of 5 5 european cities were the top performer globally notably amsterdam up 33 madrid up 18 and berlin up 13 annualized rental growth for prime offices across 30 markets remained steady with full year 2018 registering growth of 3 8 global office leasing markets exceeded expectations over the past year totaling nearly 463 million square feet 5 higher than in 2017 in the fourth quarter however global volumes were down 6 compared with the year ago at the same time global vacancy rate declined to a cyclically low of 11 3 any growth in prime rental growth equaled the 2017 rate of 3 8 in this environment our overall growth was almost completely organic with our real estate services business leading the way producing record fee revenue of approximately 6 billion growth was led by leasing corporate solutions and project and development services despite a slight decline in our overall capital markets revenue real estate services achieved double digit revenue growth and margin expansion as i noted earlier lasalle produced significant revenue growth reflecting record incentive fees and increased advisory fees for details see slide 13 in the supplemental slides document advertisement advertisement so taken together we had a very strong year proof of the collective power and diversity of our services and the breadth of our global platform now let s turn to trish for detailed comments on our performance in the quarter and for the full year trish maxson chief administrative officer and interim chief financial officer thank you christian it s a pleasure to report the details of such a strong finish to 2018 our fourth quarter exceeded expectations and significantly contributed to the record full year results as christian noted we grew revenue by double digit for both the quarter and the year advertisement advertisement on a local currency basis consolidated revenue and fee revenue increased 15 and 16 respectively compared to fourth quarter 2017 and on a full year basis revenue grew 13 all segments achieved growth in revenue and nearly all of that was organic for the year total organic growth was stronger compared to organic growth achieved in 2017 the increase was primarily driven by strong performance in leasing corporate solutions and lasalle incentive fees consolidated adjusted ebitda margin expanded by 130 basis points despite reduced capital markets revenues and continued platform and technology investments a reminder as we turn to service line and segment results we report percentage changes in local currency except for capital markets which aligns with us dollar denominated research data consolidated leasing fee revenue grew at a very impressive 27 for the quarter the outcome of outstanding performance across our real estate services segments this was exceptional considering the 7 decline in global market gross absorption year to date leasing fee revenue grew 15 also outpacing the modest 5 increase in full year gross absorption all geographic segments experienced growth most notably the americas our consolidated capital markets fee revenue declined 12 against fourth quarter 2017 primarily the result of reduced investment sales in emea and asia pacific on a full year basis capital markets fee revenue declined by 1 against the 4 increase in global investment sales advertisement advertisement our year on year underperformance against the market is attributable to our outsized growth in the prior year in 2017 we benefited from investments in the americas capital markets debt business the stellar uk rebound in transactions and sizable deals across all geographies all of which led to double digit growth against 2017 property and facility management fee revenue grew 17 for the quarter and 10 for the year project and development services grew 15 for both the quarter and the year while advisory and consulting grew 13 for the quarter and 12 for the year corporate solutions drove the double digit revenue growth across all geographies aided by the stabilization of integral and growth in our tetris fit out business in emea turning to margins on an as reported basis adjusted ebitda margin calculated on a fee revenue basis was 19 7 for the quarter and 14 7 for the year this represents margin expansion of 200 basis points and 130 basis points respectively margin expansion for both the quarter and year was primarily driven by organic growth in real estate services the broad based impact of growth in leasing profitable growth in corporate solutions and the stabilization of integral more than offset the headwind of lower capital markets revenue our positive operating performance allowed for continued strategic investments in technology and our global platform please see slide 7 of the supplemental materials for ebitda margin details for the full year and fourth quarter in 2018 we continued investing in both client facing tools and internal platform enhancements for the quarter and full year approximately 75 of the additional investment spend was related to technology investments as previously mentioned the financial system upgrade in emea and asia pacific is scheduled for implementation in 2019 advertisement advertisement turning now to debt management total net debt was 289 million at quarter end reflecting a decrease of 454 million from the third quarter and a decrease of nearly 300 million from fourth quarter 2017 the decreases reflect continued strong cash generation and our ongoing ability to improve our net debt position compared to fourth quarter 2017 net debt to adjusted ebitda declined from 0 8x to 0 3x in 2018 for the year cash flow from operations was approximately 600 million representing a 110 of adjusted net income from an m and a standpoint in the fourth quarter we did close the acquisition of aviva investors real estate multi manager business and assumed full ownership of the management of the encore plus fund more recently

9 for the year advisory and consulting businesses grew 24 for the quarter and 27 for the year the significant growth of all three service lines was largely due to corporate solutions new contract awards and expansion of services for existing clients americas adjusted ebitda margin calculated on a fee revenue basis was 19 3 for the quarter and 16 3 for the year an increase of 180 basis points for the quarter and a 110 basis points for the year on an as reported basis for the quarter taking into account an approximately 120 basis point tailwind from the impact of asc 606 margin expanded by

for the quarter and 140 basis points for the year on an as reported basis stabilization of integral and reduced bad debt provisions drove margin improvement in the quarter and full year moving to asia pacific fee revenue increased 3 over fourth quarter 2017 and 6 for the year growth for the quarter and full year was led by organic growth in property and facility management and leasing and was partially offset by a decline in capital markets revenue capital markets fee revenue declined 38 for the quarter and 20 for the year against 2017 the decline is largely due to prior year outsized performance driven by a handful of large transactions growth of nearly 50 in fourth quarter 2017 against fourth quarter 2016 created a difficult comparable leasing fee revenue for the fourth quarter grew 16 over 2017 and 18 for the year reflecting record performance for the quarter due to an increase in deals and increased productivity from new hires growth was driven by australia china hong kong

clients project and development services fee revenue was up 24 for the quarter and 20 for the year we had a strong finish to the year as large projects reached completion advisory and consulting growth of 4 for the quarter and 6 for the year was driven by corporate solutions clients asia pacific adjusted ebitda margin calculated on a fee revenue basis was 21 3 for the quarter and 13 2 for the year an increase of 70 basis points for the quarter and a decline of 90 basis points for the year on an as reported basis for the quarter after taking into account an approximate 20 basis point tailwind from the impact of asc 606 margin expanded by 50 basis points on a like for like basis for the quarter the margin expansion was largely attributable to organic growth in leasing corporate solutions and the benefits from cost saving initiatives these combined to more than offset the margin pressure from lower capital markets revenues for the full year contract losses mentioned previously and incremental platform investments led to margin contraction moving to our investment management business lasalle fee revenue growth for the quarter was 69 and 52 for the year lasalle s fourth quarter and full year results reflect strong performance driven by outstanding incentive fees predominantly from asset dispositions in asia 70 million of incentive fees for the quarter and 216 million for the year drove approximately 90 of the revenue equity earnings for the quarter were 5 4 million and 30 million for the year and result of net valuation increases in sale gains on legacy investments lasalle adjusted ebitda margin calculated on a fee revenue basis was 25 for the quarter and 31 7 for the year on an as reported basis adjusted ebitda margin expanded by 140 basis points on a local currency basis compared to full year 2017 this was primarily the result of incentive fee growth and margin expansion on private equity annuity fees and was slightly offset by decreased equity earnings for the quarter margin contracted by 420 points on a local currency basis primarily as a result of a decline in equity earnings for the period and the timing of operating expenses for the year lasalle raised 6 1 billion in new capital with 2 billion raised in the fourth quarter excluding recent acquisitions we ended the year with record level assets under management of 60 5 billion for 2019 we expect incentive fees to normalize and have modest expectations for equity earnings reflecting a moderation in asset sales and valuation increases lastly in fourth quarter 2018 we reported an incremental income tax expense of 47 million as a result of truing up the 2017 provision estimate relating to us tax legislation changes the 2018 impact to diluted earnings per share was 1 02 with no impact to adjusted diluted earnings per share i ll now turn the call back to christian for final remarks christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer thank you trish slide 19 lists a few of our recent wins across service lines and geographies our corporate solutions business maintained its win rate momentum in 2018 winning 145 new assignments expanding existing relationships with another 78 clients and renewing 52 contracts these 275 wins totaled 570 million square feet across all regions for the year we achieved a 69 win rate or new business expansions and renewals the one highlight merck a leading global healthcare company retained us for integrated facility management services at 125 locations in 63 countries around the world representative wins in capital markets included in the us the 400 million sale of the hammes medical office portfolio a diverse group of 23 class a outpatient properties in nine states totaling nearly 1 million square feet of space in poland we advised unibail rodamco on the sale of the 484 000 square foot lumen and skylight office buildings for eur190 million and in australia we represented blackstone in the sale of melbourne s waverley gardens shopping center for aud178 million in leasing and management activity in india we represented wpp marketing communications to consolidate more than 15 business groups into 256 000 square feet in a single facility in mumbai in texas we represented hewlett packard enterprise in 568 000 square foot lease at two buildings in springwoods village in houston and in poland we represented rhenus a leading provider of logistics services to lease 441 000 square feet of warehouse space near warsaw at lasalle assets under management totaled 60 5 billion at year end as trish mentioned in her remarks in november lasalle completed the acquisition of aviva s multi manager business with 6 billion in assets under management to create a new business line lasalle global partner solutions and in january lasalle closed the majority acquisition of the 1 2 billion debt fund business of latitude management real estate investors since lasalle assets under management totals are reported one quarter in arrears the 60 5 billion figure does not include assets under management from either acquisition moving to market outlook undoubtedly post the political uncertainties in the world and therefore the global outlook are becoming increasingly difficult to predict the current forecast for 2019 shows a global gdp growing 3 4 compared with the 3 7 last year there were some signs in the fourth quarter that demand is softening at the same time still growing rate of capital continues to target real estate and occupier fundamentals remain robust our research indicates investment activity to slow by no more than 5 to 10 in 2019 which still represents a healthy level of activity consistent with the last few years an increase in new office supply for this year could translate into slightly higher vacancy rates however the added supply will provide a broader range of choices for occupiers and thereby support another year of strong leasing activity at levels similar to 2018 we remain confident about our ability to keep growing our business in this environment we see tremendous momentum particularly in the americas if we look at fourth quarter gdp driven revenue for leasing and project development services in the region we see that our own growth accelerated during the fourth quarter to levels considerably higher for the quarter than for the full year and we are working proactively to maintain renewed growth in emea and asia pacific in asia we strengthened our teams in china and japan with notable hires which we expect to benefit from in 2019 we continue to transform our platform delivering ahead of plan on our beyond strategy and particularly our corporate solutions business continues to make great strides with strong pipeline and drive toward further margin expansion adding to that we are making great progress with our focus on offering our clients industry leading digital services as we gain more momentum we expect our digital services and products to contribute over 100 million in direct revenues reinforcing another important pillar of our beyond strategy consistent with our 2025 long term growth targets in 2019 we expect 6 to 8 organic fee revenue growth in our real estate services business and we have lifted our long term consolidated adjusted ebitda margin profile target to 12 5 to 14 5 to close our prepared remarks on this call we always mention just a few of the many awards and honors that our people have earned forbes named us one of the best companies for diversity fortune honored us as one of the world s most admired

lasalle who made these and other awards possible and thanks to all our people around the world for continuing to serve our clients and our firm so well now let s take your questions operator could you please explain the process questions and answers operator certainly operator instructions your first question comes from mitch germain with jmp securities your line is open mitch germain jmp securities analyst good morning christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer good morning mitch mitch germain jmp securities analyst nice quarter christian two years in change into your tenure and i remember you established some strategic framework for what you wanted to accomplish how do you stand in terms of what has been done at the company and what should we expect for the next few years christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer 2018 was an exceptional year for us because we really made a lot of progress in that change program more than we had hoped for at the beginning of the year obviously we are very much supported by that strong economic environment we are operating as a company and we go with a lot of headwind into 2019 and we will continue to drive those changes i think change will be a common pattern for every corporate in this world and so we should take it as a normal course of doing business that you have to constantly transform and adapt your operations mitch germain jmp securities analyst great thank you i know christian you mentioned pipelines corporate solutions were strong but i m curious about the transaction business 4q being highly volatile particularly here in the us did that impact the growth of your pipelines in the transaction business as we enter 2019 christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well i mean the us is very very strong and we started the year with a strong backlog into the first quarter in the us and europe the situation is a bit more muted obviously that whole debate around brexit has an impact although i have to say that our uk business in the fourth quarter did really well and they also had a pretty good start into the first quarter now but overall we can t dismiss that brexit has an impact on mood in asia pacific the situation was more within jll we had some challenges we had to deal with in our transaction business especially around the capital markets front and but we have sorted that out and we are starting the year with a much much stronger team than we had during the course of last year so we are fairly optimistic for that piece of the business in our asia pacific business for 2019 mitch germain jmp securities analyst great last one from me i know you guys had referenced capital markets being influenced by some tough comps from the prior year here in 2018 i m curious the success that you had in leasing and how should we think about potentially the comps as we head into 2019 christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well leasing was a very strong year in 2018 but frankly speaking we don t expect anything else from 2019 we have built just a really really strong platform with a great team which are delivering outstanding services and the momentum into 2019 is brilliant and on the capital markets side we did some great hires also in the us you know we took over a very large team in new york and so our outlook for 2019 is pretty irrespective of the market outlook very optimistic mitch germain jmp securities analyst thank you operator your next question comes from anthony paolone with jp morgan your line is open anthony paolone jp morgan analyst thank you and nice quarter first i just wanted to clarify something christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer good morning anthony anthony paolone jp morgan analyst hi christian i want to make sure i caught your comments toward the end of your remarks properly the 6 to 8 organic fee revenue growth was that for 2019 i missed the time frame that you put on christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer yes that was for 2019 anthony paolone jp morgan analyst okay great christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer in our real estate services business anthony paolone jp morgan analyst okay got it ok and then so just on leasing as we go into 2019 you mentioned a fairly constant backdrop and i think the commentary was 5 gross absorption and you all were able to grow i think 15 and so that s quite a bit of market share pickup i mean how do you think about the ability to continue to gain that much share as we look into 2019 christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer while we have been picking up a lot of market share over the last couple of years continuously and frankly speaking at the moment we believe that we still have headroom to continue to do so we don t see any reason for any pause coming to us as i said to mitch already we have built a very very strong platform and that starts kind of to reinvigorate itself all the time when you have great people working for you other great people want to join and that creates a very strong momentum anthony paolone jp morgan analyst okay and then i guess same thing on capital markets following up on i think some of the comments from mitch do you think that recruiting in market share is enough to produce growth in what you laid out as being a bit of a shrinking backdrop for 19 christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well i mean you can either recruit and grow market share or you can do m and a we are looking at all ways of growing our business in our capital markets services as you know this is one of our strategic growth areas which we have pointed out at investor day and we are working on that topic anthony paolone jp morgan analyst okay with 0 3x net debt and an appetite to do strategic m and a what does that pipeline look like is it better or worse than it was three to six months ago christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well there s a lot of availability in the market at the moment to do m and a but one very important factor is that you keep your discipline on capital allocation and whether we have low debt or higher debt levels we always keep the same discipline here and so that s what we are doing anthony paolone jp morgan analyst okay and then last question for me i think if i look at your margin build up year over year and i look at what you spent on technology and other investments that impacted margins it seems like the dollar figure is something in the 60 million or so mark 60 million or so range how do you think that looks in 2019 i guess is one part of the question and then the other is what is that as a growth rate percentage particularly as we think about technology spending like this in up 2 number 10 number i mean how are those expenses growing christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well first and foremost we have been very transparent around our journey up to 2025 we started off with the margin profile between 12 and 14 as an adjusted ebitda margin and in that range depending on what the market allows us to do we are investing heavily into our organization and technology and going digital is a big chunk of it and we have as we called out here raised our margin profile now to 12 5 to 14 5 because we are starting to see benefits coming in from all that investment so that we can continue that investment path and at the same time increase our margin profile and that s how you should think for 2019 and going forward we have laid out a journey to 2025 what we want to do with the company and with the margin profile of the company and as we move forward we will continue to increase that and at the same time continue to invest in the platform and especially into the technology anthony paolone jp morgan analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from jade rahmani with kbw your line is open jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst thanks very much i was wondering if you could give some color on the expectation for 5 to 10 decline in investment activity in the market for example can you give any color on whether you saw any volatility in december and even january perhaps relative to typical seasonality or your expectations christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well in december there was a bit more volatility in the market because our markets are also influenced by overall sentiment and if you know the public markets in december were pretty volatile and that drives into our world as well january has started pretty strongly as the public markets have improved in january so though i don t want to make a connection which is too close between the public market and our markets business base there is a slight correlation there with regard to the outlook for 2019 the 5 to 10 this is the number which our researchers have come up with and we always should keep in mind that we are currently trading at a very high volume level this is true for leasing and for capital markets so when i see those numbers which predict a 5 to 10 decline frankly that is not at all concerning to me because it s a decline from a very very high level and then with regard to capital markets specifically for jll as you know our market share and capital markets in the us is still not where we want it to be so this 5 to 10 wouldn t be an excuse for us for not growing our business jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst and just to stay on the market for another moment in terms of bid list on transactions are you seeing any changes of note are you seeing any decline in the number of bidders or perhaps concentrations in pricing perhaps at the lower end christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well this is not as straightforward you know sometimes you see a little bit of a decrease in the bidder queue on building and then you have another product in the market of one of a sudden they all going for that product again and you have a very strong bidding list overall there still a lot of capital which is trying to get into the real estate market as you know overall we are at new record levels of capital which is sitting up the sideline which wants to get into the real estate market so i think the fundamental underlying trend is still very very strong and as i said we had a bit of a volatility in december but as we have seen now january coming in at the moment it is going back to normal and that may also be influenced that obviously the expectations around interest rates in the us have slightly changed with regard to the amount of increase we will see 19 jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst in terms of target market share for the us capital markets i agree that s really large opportunity for jll is that going to be executed based on strategic m and a or more strategic hiring christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well for the time being we do a lot of strategic hiring and if we have an opportunity for strategic m and a we would be very happy to do so but as i said before only if we can stick to our principles around really disciplined capital allocation jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst and what s the target in terms of market share i think right now you probably ranked six or so christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer yeah we don t have a target in itself usually in areas like capital markets and leasing we want to be number one or number two in any market in the world which we have as our strategic markets now we are far off in the us so we have still a long way to go and we are working on it just stay tuned with us on that jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst and in terms of operating leverage in the us capital markets business it is quite significant because of the number of leasing offices that you already have opened can you can you higher capital markets brokers and put them in those same offices or do you need to make any fixed cost investment christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer i mean we have a very strong office footprint in the us so we don t need to open any further offices over and above the existing ones so on that end we can use our existing platform the challenge is that you have to find talent with the right values with the right culture and with that kind of clear discipline to try to get to an outstanding result for the clients and if we can identify those type of people and get them into the organization then that is a good outcome for us jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst in terms of the dramatic growth that we have been seeing particularly the second half of 2018 how much of it is driven by co working and how much is also driven by the technology sector more broadly and finally how much is driven by new construction completions christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well clearly i can say for us that the flex space companies as we would call them have become important client base for us and so quite a significant proportion of that additional growth is coming from them and the other piece you already pointed it out the technology sector we have a high market share in the technology sector and they have been very active in the market and that was another part of our growth but we are focusing also on other industries which are doing really well i mean what you see is that despite all the talk about a potential decline in the economy the successful companies are doing really well and we tend to have a very strong client base among those companies and so with that we are also able to have that strong growth as we have shown in 2018 jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst can you comment on the trends you re seeing in the apac segment particularly with respect to concerns about china s growth slowing christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer i m not quite sure whether i understood the first part of your sentence what was the first part of your sentence jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst what s your view regarding the overall macro environment in the apac segment christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer okay jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst and specifically with respect to concerns about china s growth slowing christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well i mean there are a lot of smart people who are analyzing the growth of china what we can see so far is that we still have a very healthy business we added a significant amount of employees into our china business and they are very busy i think there is for our industry still a tremendous room to grow because chinese companies are professionalizing they have they also have high ambitions on the corporate real estate and the way they want to place their people in offices and so there s a tremendous amount of services which we can deliver if anything slows us down on china it s the lack of talent and we employ currently around 16 000 people in china and we would be very happy to employ more if we could just find them and so far we haven t seen any impact from that discussions around china slowing down or the trade discussions between us and china but you know if that is going to come into play going forward we may see something but so far so good i would say jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst okay turning to the lasalle segment the fee revenue performance in the fourth quarter dramatically exceeded our projections but adjusted ebitda was close to what we modeled so i m wondering if in the expense lines whether there was an increase driven by the acquisitions you completed in that segment or whether there is any market to market impact within the securities business christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well it is partly driven by the fact that we had lower equity earnings and that is driving that result in a different way than you might have expected it i mean there s also some timing with regard to expenses which have come into the fourth quarter and so going forward i mean as much as we obviously like those outsized incentive fees but going forward lasalle s business will be much more normal again in its performance so we are on a trajectory to increase our margin on the underlying annuity income and we have made great progress over the last couple of years and that will continue but we will see obviously less incentive fees in 2019 than we had in 2018 jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst thanks for taking the questions christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer sure operator your next question comes from david ridley lane with bank of america merrill lynch your line is open david ridley lane bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you wondering if you could provide a little more color on the real estate services margins in 2019 i know that integral has stabilized do you have a sense of how much of a margin drag that was in 2018 that won t now be repeating in 2019 christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well i can give you a high level answer we made tremendous progress on our real estate services margin from 17 to 18 about 80 basis points and we are pretty optimistic that we will continue to make progress on that in 2019 i can t give you the detail how much of that will be driven by a further improvement of integral frankly speaking i mean as much as it is an important investment in europe for the overall company the impact is not that strong that we would have that percentage at hand whether that how much of that progress will be driven by integral david ridley lane bank of america merrill lynch analyst understood and then i ll ask on the european technology spending question sort of a slightly different way i know you ve already been asked that but is that an incremental drag to margins in 2019 christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer you said european technology spending david ridley lane bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer sorry i m an european you mean erp ph i will leave the question to trish trish maxson chief administrative officer and interim chief financial officer yeah so this year it was about it was about half of our technology drag for 2018 and so looking into 2019 we do need to complete the emea and asia pacific implementation for peoplesoft that actually will continue to be a spend for us we don t anticipate that it s a tremendous increase over 2018 but we still may have some expenses that come in for that because we do as i said we are completing that implementation in 2019 david ridley lane bank of america merrill lynch analyst and then last one really quickly for me when you say you expect lasalle incentive fees to normalize can you remind all the all of us the level you expect or the level you would characterize as normal for incentive fees and transaction fees trish maxson chief administrative officer and interim chief financial officer yeah so for i mentioned this earlier we expect the lasalle incentive fees to come somewhere in the range of 30 to 50 that s a little bit lower than what you might think of as normal though that s difficult to really define given the volatility david ridley lane bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right thank you very much operator your next question comes from stephen sheldon with william blair your line is open stephen sheldon william blair and co analyst good morning thank you so you ve given some commentary on tax spending but just looking for a little more detail i think you ve been spending close to 8 fee revenue on both base it costs and strategic tech investments so i guess would you expect that to continue in 2019 and more of the composition between those two categories base it and strategic look much different i guess specifically are you seeing leverage in base it costs that will allow you to invest more on the strategic tech side this year christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer exactly that s what we are working for and that s what s happening we have made tremendous progress over the last couple of years on what you call base it cost infrastructure and we are making strides in pushing that down as a percentage to revenue and at the same time we are increasing our investment in client facing applications and that will continue to do so i mean we are targeting a spend which is where 8 is at the higher end of what you mentioned 8 but within that percentage spend the client application piece is going up and the infrastructure base it piece is going down stephen sheldon william blair and co analyst got it that s helpful and then you talked about hiring in china and japan that should help trends in 2019 and asia pacific can you provide some detail on which service lines you ve been hiring christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer in china specifically around capital markets the broader kind of transaction services we have a very very strong facility management and property management business there and we are we continue to build more the transactional side of services in japan it is across the board but again predominantly on the leasing and capital markets side we still have a long way to grow in japan considering the overall gdp of japan the size of the economy our business can continue to grow for many many years at the same rate as it has been stephen sheldon william blair and co analyst got it and then last one from me i guess just any update on the cfo search christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well i have a great cfo sitting next to me and she s smiling at me so that s a good start no we are working on it and we are making good progress i would say but again it s quite similar to the discipline we are having around capital allocations we are keeping our discipline here to find the person which is ideally the perfect fit for us we are under no pressure to doing it because we are a great team as we are currently but we are still working on it unfortunately trish will not continue as our cfo going forward stephen sheldon william blair and co analyst all right thank you i appreciate it operator your next question comes from marc riddick with sidoti your line is open marc riddick sidoti and company analyst hi good morning christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer hi marc marc riddick sidoti and company analyst hi good morning so several of my questions were actually answered on some of the prior questions but i did want to follow up a little bit on the acquisition marketplace i suppose and just wanted to get your general sense i mean i can understand the commentary around keeping your discipline and what you re looking for but i guess wanted to get maybe just sort of a high level view on kind of what you see is available out there and how you feel about the current and multiples of things that might be attractive to you thank you christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well at least in my career i have never seen a market which has so many availabilities with regards to m and a as it currently has i think that s probably quite normal we are on a late cycle moment and a long upturn swing and so a lot of companies are currently interested in finding a new home and so we have quite a lot of work going on and analyzing the different opportunities but we have been pretty clear which areas are of interest to us at our investor day and that hasn t really changed with regard to multiple great companies are expecting a strong multiple and less than great companies we are not interested in and so that s the obvious squeeze on the one hand you don t want to overpay on the other hand you only want to buy really outstanding companies who are a good fit for jll marc riddick sidoti and company analyst okay and then one thing i did want to circle back on is and i appreciate the commentary around the it spending and the commentary around the erp needs going into 19 i was wondering if there is any particular concentration of spend that we should be thinking about or how it might flow through the year to sort of be prepared for it thank you christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well as we said i mean trish just alluded to it we are finishing up our erp platform on the finance side in emea and apac we already finished on the hr side so that is one area of concentration still and then with regard to client applications we have given now for the first time a bit of information around the revenues we are expecting from those type of client applications and we have pretty strong ambitions on that going forward and so that will continue to be a real priority for us to invest into client applications which are driving direct revenues into the organization next to those applications which are supporting kind of existing revenue streams which we have like the nxt trish mentioned marc riddick sidoti and company analyst great thank you very much operator your next question comes from jade rahmani with kbw your line is open jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst thanks very much on the strategic m and a side do you see any compelling rationale for mergers between the public companies in the commercial real estate services sector christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well whether those companies are public on or whether they are not public doesn t really make a difference for us the question is whether they are great fit for us and so on that end that isn t anything which would bother us whether they are public or whether they re not public i think your question goes more directly to the question is it does it make sense to kind of merge with a company which provides exactly the same services or whether you are complementing you services and both can drive value obviously complementing is an easier one to say yes to but also doing something which is offering the same type of services makes sense if it offers you a scale in a way which really then helps you to drive your costs down and strengthening your market position we have done that only once to my knowledge of size and that was in 2011 when we did in the uk king sturge king sturge was doing exactly what we were doing in the uk they were pretty much exactly the same size and it really boosted our uk business at that time and it was a great decision doing it but that happens relatively rarely that you have those type of opportunities which makes sense and drive value for your shareholders jade j rahmani keefe bruyette woods analyst thanks very much operator there are no further questions at this time i ll now turn the call back over to management for closing comments christian ulbrich president and chief executive officer well thank you with no further questions we close today s call thank you for participating and we look forward to speaking with you again following the first quarter operator ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the program you may now disconnect everyone have a wonderful day duration 59 minutes call participants grace t chang managing director of global corporate finance and investor relations christian ulbrich

when it comes to the trade talks with china president donald trump and his negotiators have more leverage than any us administration has ever had chinese policymakers are desperate for a trade truce with the us in order to avoid more damage to china s economy by further pressuring its trade surplus and export industries there is speculation that trump has told his negotiators to get a deal done in order to put an end to recent market volatility but that would mean forgoing a historic opportunity to come to a major restructuring of america s relationship with china at a moment when china is most inclined to agree to concessions we have come too far for trump to take the easy way out water keeps the boat afloat but can also sink it is a chinese proverb that neatly summarizes the nation s current economic predicament the debt that has hydrated the chinese financial system for the past 10 years is now drowning it during the darkest days of the financial crisis in 2008 china launched a 4 trillion renminbi 593 billion in today s dollars infrastructure plan that was accurately described as pulling the global economy out of recession this infrastructure stimulus plan never ceased and by 2017 the spending ballooned from 4 trillion to 14 trillion renminbi according to china s national bureau of statistics at first china benefited from the economic reforms of the 1990s its accession to the world trade organization and the resultant inflow of foreign investment by western companies by 2009 the previous decade of strong growth meant wages and price levels had risen such that china was no longer a low cost manufacturer this made it implausible that exports could drive economic growth therefore china s central bank printed money to fund a gargantuan stimulus program history tells us that growth that is funded by excessively rapid credit and money creation can lead to a variety of asset bubbles and to financial credit and currency crises a broad measure based on data from the people s bank of china and other agencies that includes both bank assets and shadow banking assets such as wealth management products trust beneficiary rights and trust loans places china s total credit at 48 trillion about 3 7 times its gross domestic product that compares with 24 trillion for the us despite china having an economy that is 37 percent smaller china s decade of rapid credit creation and investment spending has led to soaring property values despite high vacancy and low wage levels these led to tepid export growth and a stagnating economy as the export industry lost competitiveness the last 12 months have seen key chinese economic indicators such as industrial production car sales retail sales and investment all decline to multiyear lows as the previous round of stimulus abated and china s debt burden continued to cause a downward economic spiral the world is finally waking up to the risks to the precarious position of the overleveraged chinese financial system which is why we have seen its stock market fall as much as 25 percent over the last year disclosure hayman capital management where the author is chief investment officer has positions in the chinese currency us negotiators are focused on asking china to make two changes 1 buy more us goods and 2 abandon an industrial policy that grants unique advantages namely widespread government subsidies protected domestic markets and regulatory preferences to chinese government affiliated national champions primarily focusing on the first objective is a mistake because it will ultimately erode the advanced parts of the us economy which support the most valuable jobs in the us this does not advance america s long term interests and is only a short term fix for a very complex problem reducing tariff rates and adjusting foreign ownership rules would be a good thing but would not end china s long standing policy of bulk economic espionage and theft which annually costs america s economy at least 300 billion according to us government estimates multiple us administrations have sought to engage china on these issues for more than two decades and the commitments made to the us have rarely been fulfilled america needs a commitment from china s government that it will put an end to espionage and theft and agree to legal and financial repercussions for theft trump s administration should continue to push for this and not end talks until there is permanent change in china s behavior for china to be a constructive member of the multilateral world trading system it must grant foreign companies operating either inside china or outside the same rights and privileges as party affiliated national champions the current mercantilist system based on subsidies and preferences needs to be dismantled but the concessions offered to date lack commitment the trump administration needs to fully understand that the leverage it has today and the increased leverage it will have after march 1 the end of the 90 day reprieve from the imposition of additional tariffs is the most the us will ever have to squander this opportunity would be a catastrophe not only for trump s administration but for the west j kyle bass j kyle bass is founder and chief investment officer of hayman capital management ed bloomberg

trumpâ s quest to undermine multilateral development banks in the postwar era the multilateral development banks were created to facilitate global trade today they are america first targets recently the white house has been pushing its america first stance in the world trade organization wto by controversial appeals to a national security exception in response to the trump tariffs several wto members have brought dispute settlement cases against the u s world bank is next in the firing line reportedly the white house will announce david malpass as the nominee for president of the world bank after jim yong kim s resignation well before the end of his five year term in 2022 in the 2016 election malpass served as trump s economic advisor a year later he was appointed undersecretary for international affairs in the u s department of the treasury but he is an odd choice to head the world bank a bit like selecting a coal ceo to head the struggle against climate change an america first world bank like u s representative of trade robert lighthizer malpass began his political career in the 1980s reagan administration seeking to contain the rise of japan through the section 301 of the 1974 trade act the same unilateral legislation trump is exploiting against china in the current trade dispute during his 15 years as chief economist at bear stearns malpass was not known for his economic foresight a year before the global crisis he wrote that housing and debt market corrections will probably add to the length of the u s economic expansion and amidst lingering crisis he urged for higher interest rates during his tenure as under secretary of the treasury for international affairs malpass has taken an aggressive position against china in early 2018 he slammed china s non market behavior advocating stronger responses when trump tariff wars began some 20 career staff quit malpass s unit in less than a year opposing the administration s unilateral trade policies and malpass s poor leadership style to malpass the world bank is a giant sprawl of international organizations that create mountains of debt without solving problems he promotes a new debt transparency initiative that would shed more light on the international liabilities of the world s governments such an initiative would not target america s 22 trillion pile of sovereign debt but china s belt and road initiative bri should he walk the talk that could cause a fatal rift in world bank as of november 2018 the largest recipients of world bank loans were india 859 million in 2018 and china 370 million in 2018 malpass could subject china and its loans into a politicized scrutiny effectively extending u s investment reviews through the bank in that view his nomination has done nothing to diminish china s concerns that the existing international institutions will not accommodate it toward america first imf since the bretton woods the president of the world bank has been an american while the international monetary fund imf has been led by a european both institutions are located in washington d c and work closely with each other as international extensions of the u s department of the treasury as critics contend amid the 2008 crisis fall imf chief dominique strauss kahn managed to achieve g20 cooperation that contained the global free fall in exchange advanced economies pledged commitment to global governance reforms in multilateral development banks yet those reforms were ignored after strauss kahn was replaced with french finance minister christine lagarde as global managing partner of u s headquartered baker mckenzie lagarde lived full time in chicago until 2005 through the nomination process she was subject of a legal investigation over alleged abuse of power in the tapie affair in 2016 a french court found her guilty of negligence but did not impose a penalty that s how lagarde was re appointed for another five year term at imf imf s economic stance is shifting toward washington as well recently lagarde appointed gina gopinath as the imf chief economist to succeed maurice obstfeld gopinath is a veteran u s economistand co director at national bureau of economic research in her most recent work she has been an outspoken advocate of the u s dollar whose dominance she expects to continue largely undisturbed she has cooperated with former imf economic counselor kenneth rogoff who has for years criticized china s debt as opposed to u s debt as a global risk since 2011 brics economies brazil russia india china and south africa have stressed that the selection of the imf chief on the basis of nationality undermines its international legitimacy in a 2015 interview even jim yong kim predicted that you will never again see an imf or a world bank election without very strong contention coming especially from the developing world despite the 2010 cosmetic reforms advanced economies continue to dominate world bank voting shares over emerging economies today the seven major advanced economies account for 45 and the largest seven emerging economies almost 30 of the world economy nevertheless advanced countries still control nearly 40 of world bank voting shares as opposed to only 9 to 15 by emerging economies figure figure advanced and emerging economies economic versus voting power nominal gdp 2019 voting power 2019 ibrd ida world bank red the share of seven largest emerging economies of total votes blue the share of seven largest advanced economies of total vote the world bank comprises the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd which provides loans to middle income economies and the international development association ida which targets low income economies there is a gap between the economic share of emerging economies and their voice in the international community and the gap is deepening since emerging economies are growing relatively faster their economic share will exceed that of advanced economies within a decade or two from reforms to retrenchment since the early 2010s china has been promoting the huge multi decade belt and road initiative bri which seeks to energize industrialization and modernization in many large emerging and developing economies the obama administration took a skeptical view of the initiative which the trump administration has branded as a national security risk to america in october 2013 china proposed creating a new multilateral development bank the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib in the obama era the white house stayed out of the aiib and tried but failed to prevent its partners and allies from joining the bank a year later brazil russia india china and south africa launched the new development bank ndb to accelerate lending on infrastructure projects the obama white house sought to marginalize it while the trump administration sees cooperative activities with potential eurasian hegemons as a national security risk as the world bank may face a divisive political struggle u s interests are growing more prominent at the imf while the wto has been targeted by trade hawks attempts by emerging and developing economies to help themselves are shunned as security threats to american interests meanwhile the west s multilateral development banks are bailing out rich european economies targeting poorer ones and sanctioning those that oppose washington s unilateralism the gap between the multipolar 21st century world economy and aging west which created its prosperity through colonial plunder in the 19th

for years andrew gehrt of greenville s c bounced among several low and mid wage jobs in food services retail and sales until he was laid off from a position as a sales rep for a water filter company but after being unemployed for a year the 29 year old landed a job in september as business development manager for a technology company at a salary of about 60 000 i felt stuck he says now i have a very hopeful outlook for the next five to eight years in his state of the union address last week president trump vowed the country can make its middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before despite economists longstanding laments of a shrinking hollowed out middle class trump s pledge didn t seem so quixotic at least judging by recent history the vibrant economy juiced further by the trump led tax cuts and federal spending increases has lifted employment and wages for workers at all levels including the middle class the manufacturing construction and oil industries traditional middle class bastions have enjoyed revivals the past couple of years and the replacement of many middle wage workers with technology has slowed yet analysts say america s middle class will soon resume its long term decline largely as a result of automation and the continued offshoring of factory jobs unless policymakers take dramatic steps to alter that course the trend left to its own devices is going to get worse says richard reeves director of the future of the middle class initiative at the brookings institution a growing prosperous confident middle class is no longer going to happen automatically more property taxes vary by state here s a look at what you ll pay tax season tips tax refund advance loans are often too good to be true here s what you should know minimum wage from california to new york states are raising minimum wages in 2019 for 17 million workers economist adam kamins of moody s analytics agrees adding i think it s a major concern for the u s economy mid wage jobs defined as paying 14 18 to 23 59 an hour are expected to grow by 4 45 percent from 2018 to 2023 compared with about 6 26 percent growth for both low and high wage jobs according to a careerbuilder study fifty eight percent of jobs lost during that period will be mid wage the report says middle class makes recent advances the recent trend has been positive median u s household income which includes paychecks as well as social security public assistance and investment income rose 1 8 percent to an all time high of 61 372 in 2017 according to the most recent census bureau figures that followed gains of 5 2 percent in 2015 and 3 2 percent in 2016 yet after adjusting for inflation that income roughly equaled the level in 2007 before the start of the great recession it s making up for lost ground but it doesn t really get people ahead says elise gould senior economist at the left leaning economic policy institute from 2010 to 2018 inflation adjusted pay rose 1 5 percent for the middle quintile of workers based on earnings compared with 6 5 percent for the bottom quintile and 2 9 percent for the top according to figures from brookings and the labor department that data defines mid wage slightly differently than careerbuilder top earners who overwhelmingly have four year college degrees are benefiting from a job market that places a growing premium on higher skills reeves says and low paid workers have advanced as a result of state minimum wage increases and social safety net programs such as welfare and food stamps say reeves and jay shambaugh director of brookings hamilton project middle wage workers are well caught in the middle their struggles shambaugh says have been compounded by well known forces the plunge in manufacturing employment as a result of both offshoring and automation the sharp decline of unions that used to ensure higher wages for factory and other workers stagnating teacher pay and the meager growth of state and local government jobs amid budget cuts and depleted pension funds here s the good news the fortunes of the middle class have brightened recently amid a strong economy and labor market employers added an average 223 000 jobs a month last year up from 179 000 in 2017 and unemployment sank to a near 50 year low of 3 7 percent before ticking up recently leaving businesses struggling to find qualified workers we ve finally got to the point where firms are being forced to bid up for workers so you re seeing a little bit more for the middle class shambaugh says average u s wages climbed 3 3 percent in 2018 after being stuck at 2 5 percent to 2 7 percent for several years trump deserves some credit his tax cuts and spending increases boosted economic growth by seven tenths of a percentage point last year to 3 percent says economist greg daco of oxford economics and trump slashed hundreds of regulations on businesses further bolstering corporate confidence along with investment and hiring says wells fargo economist mark vitner while the initiatives also prompted longer term concerns such as swelling the budget deficit and dismantling consumer protections they ve sparked the labor market in the short term before he got his business development job gehrt says he noticed a surge in openings last year he has resumed dining out and is finally able to sock some money away so he can eventually buy a house industries that employ middle class workers in particular are benefiting manufacturers have added about 450 000 jobs since trump took office the largest two year total in decades amid an improving global economy and a rejuvenated oil industry the number of factory jobs reshored or shifted to the u s from overseas by both american and foreign companies hit a record 170 000 in 2017 and notched a still strong 131 000 last year according to the reshoring initiative which tracks the data harry moser who heads the group largely credits trump s pro business policies the oil and natural gas drilling sector itself added 11 000 jobs in 2018 while boosting pay nearly 4 percent as a result of a surge in oil prices for most of the year and construction has added 1 8 million jobs since the housing recovery began in late 2011 with average pay increasing 3 6 percent last year yet kamins notes the near term prospects for such middle class jobs are mixed trump s trade war with china is expected to curtail factory employment gains this year and oil prices have fallen sharply from their early october peak though they ve rebounded from late december lows and while the housing market is forecast to slow this year as a result of higher home prices and borrowing costs mortgage rates have moderated since the federal reserve recently signaled it may not raise its benchmark interest rate in 2019 outlook for middle class bleak unless the longer term outlook for the middle class is dimmer manufacturers are likely to continue offshoring jobs in large numbers with reshoring simply limiting the decline kamins says and automation could wipe out up to 73 million jobs by 2030 according to a 2017 mckinsey report high level workers have analytical and managerial skills that machines can t replace and low wage workers cost less and are often not worth supplanting with technology the study said others work in health care or other service industries that rely on human interaction middle wage jobs in turn are most vulnerable the report says besides factory employees that means workers who originate mortgages do paralegal or accounting work drive trucks and handle maintenance and repair while some can be easily shifted to other tasks as many as 54 million americans will need to be retrained the study says reeves credits trump for spending more on apprenticeships but says government at all levels has fallen woefully short in rolling out programs to upskill workers in many cases to work alongside robots or artificial intelligence the federal tax cuts and spending increases are substantially widening the deficit over the next decade making it even tougher to devote more money for retraining reeves says other trump administration policies also may squeeze the middle class trump s conservative appointments to the national labor relations board and supreme court are likely to further hobble unions shambaugh says and while the tax cuts help middle class americans the vast majority of benefits will go to the top 1 percent of income earners according to the tax policy center new policies can change the dynamic shambaugh and reeves say such as expanding the earned income tax credit to more filers and reversing state funding cuts that have hurt public colleges but such reforms need to happen soon reeves says a robust resilient and happy middle class is one of the things that makes america america he says if the middle class loses confidence it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy

for years andrew gehrt of greenville s c bounced among several low and mid wage jobs in food services retail and sales until he was laid off from a position as a sales rep for a water filter company but after being unemployed for a year the 29 year old landed a job in september as business development manager for a technology company at a salary of about 60 000 i felt stuck he says now i have a very hopeful outlook for the next five to eight years in his state of the union address last week president trump vowed the country can make its middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before despite economists longstanding laments of a shrinking hollowed out middle class trump s pledge didn t seem so quixotic at least judging by recent history the vibrant economy juiced further by the trump led tax cuts and federal spending increases has lifted employment and wages for workers at all levels including the middle class the manufacturing construction and oil industries traditional middle class bastions have enjoyed revivals the past couple of years and the replacement of many middle wage workers with technology has slowed yet analysts say america s middle class will soon resume its long term decline largely as a result of automation and the continued offshoring of factory jobs unless policymakers take dramatic steps to alter that course the trend left to its own devices is going to get worse says richard reeves director of the future of the middle class initiative at the brookings institution a growing prosperous confident middle class is no longer going to happen automatically more property taxes vary by state here s a look at what you ll pay tax season tips tax refund advance loans are often too good to be true here s what you should know minimum wage from california to new york states are raising minimum wages in 2019 for 17 million workers economist adam kamins of moody s analytics agrees adding i think it s a major concern for the u s economy mid wage jobs defined as paying 14 18 to 23 59 an hour are expected to grow by 4 45 percent from 2018 to 2023 compared with about 6 26 percent growth for both low and high wage jobs according to a careerbuilder study fifty eight percent of jobs lost during that period will be mid wage the report says middle class makes recent advances the recent trend has been positive median u s household income which includes paychecks as well as social security public assistance and investment income rose 1 8 percent to an all time high of 61 372 in 2017 according to the most recent census bureau figures that followed gains of 5 2 percent in 2015 and 3 2 percent in 2016 yet after adjusting for inflation that income roughly equaled the level in 2007 before the start of the great recession it s making up for lost ground but it doesn t really get people ahead says elise gould senior economist at the left leaning economic policy institute from 2010 to 2018 inflation adjusted pay rose 1 5 percent for the middle quintile of workers based on earnings compared with 6 5 percent for the bottom quintile and 2 9 percent for the top according to figures from brookings and the labor department that data defines mid wage slightly differently than careerbuilder top earners who overwhelmingly have four year college degrees are benefiting from a job market that places a growing premium on higher skills reeves says and low paid workers have advanced as a result of state minimum wage increases and social safety net programs such as welfare and food stamps say reeves and jay shambaugh director of brookings hamilton project middle wage workers are well caught in the middle their struggles shambaugh says have been compounded by well known forces the plunge in manufacturing employment as a result of both offshoring and automation the sharp decline of unions that used to ensure higher wages for factory and other workers stagnating teacher pay and the meager growth of state and local government jobs amid budget cuts and depleted pension funds here s the good news the fortunes of the middle class have brightened recently amid a strong economy and labor market employers added an average 223 000 jobs a month last year up from 179 000 in 2017 and unemployment sank to a near 50 year low of 3 7 percent before ticking up recently leaving businesses struggling to find qualified workers we ve finally got to the point where firms are being forced to bid up for workers so you re seeing a little bit more for the middle class shambaugh says average u s wages climbed 3 3 percent in 2018 after being stuck at 2 5 percent to 2 7 percent for several years trump deserves some credit his tax cuts and spending increases boosted economic growth by seven tenths of a percentage point last year to 3 percent says economist greg daco of oxford economics and trump slashed hundreds of regulations on businesses further bolstering corporate confidence along with investment and hiring says wells fargo economist mark vitner while the initiatives also prompted longer term concerns such as swelling the budget deficit and dismantling consumer protections they ve sparked the labor market in the short term before he got his business development job gehrt says he noticed a surge in openings last year he has resumed dining out and is finally able to sock some money away so he can eventually buy a house industries that employ middle class workers in particular are benefiting manufacturers have added about 450 000 jobs since trump took office the largest two year total in decades amid an improving global economy and a rejuvenated oil industry the number of factory jobs reshored or shifted to the u s from overseas by both american and foreign companies hit a record 170 000 in 2017 and notched a still strong 131 000 last year according to the reshoring initiative which tracks the data harry moser who heads the group largely credits trump s pro business policies the oil and natural gas drilling sector itself added 11 000 jobs in 2018 while boosting pay nearly 4 percent as a result of a surge in oil prices for most of the year and construction has added 1 8 million jobs since the housing recovery began in late 2011 with average pay increasing 3 6 percent last year yet kamins notes the near term prospects for such middle class jobs are mixed trump s trade war with china is expected to curtail factory employment gains this year and oil prices have fallen sharply from their early october peak though they ve rebounded from late december lows and while the housing market is forecast to slow this year as a result of higher home prices and borrowing costs mortgage rates have moderated since the federal reserve recently signaled it may not raise its benchmark interest rate in 2019 outlook for middle class bleak unless the longer term outlook for the middle class is dimmer manufacturers are likely to continue offshoring jobs in large numbers with reshoring simply limiting the decline kamins says and automation could wipe out up to 73 million jobs by 2030 according to a 2017 mckinsey report high level workers have analytical and managerial skills that machines can t replace and low wage workers cost less and are often not worth supplanting with technology the study said others work in health care or other service industries that rely on human interaction middle wage jobs in turn are most vulnerable the report says besides factory employees that means workers who originate mortgages do paralegal or accounting work drive trucks and handle maintenance and repair while some can be easily shifted to other tasks as many as 54 million americans will need to be retrained the study says reeves credits trump for spending more on apprenticeships but says government at all levels has fallen woefully short in rolling out programs to upskill workers in many cases to work alongside robots or artificial intelligence the federal tax cuts and spending increases are substantially widening the deficit over the next decade making it even tougher to devote more money for retraining reeves says other trump administration policies also may squeeze the middle class trump s conservative appointments to the national labor relations board and supreme court are likely to further hobble unions shambaugh says and while the tax cuts help middle class americans the vast majority of benefits will go to the top 1 percent of income earners according to the tax policy center new policies can change the dynamic shambaugh and reeves say such as expanding the earned income tax credit to more filers and reversing state funding cuts that have hurt public colleges but such reforms need to happen soon reeves says a robust resilient and happy middle class is one of the things that makes america america he says if the middle class loses confidence it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy

karachi the measures taken by the government so far to attract higher remittances from overseas pakistanis have started bearing fruit as inflows have remained on an uptrend from several parts of the world remittances from overseas pakistani workers increased 12 to 12 77 billion in first seven months july january of the current fiscal year compared to 11 38 billion in the same period of previous year reported the state bank of pakistan sbp on monday the remittances have remained a big source of the country s foreign income which partially help finance foreign expenditure like import payment and debt repayment and eventually narrow down the current account deficit pakistanis living in western countries including the united states and the united kingdom have remained the engine of growth in remittance inflows in january 2019 and first seven months of the current fiscal year at the same time the remittances from middle eastern countries mainly saudi arabia and the united arab emirates uae showed improvement in january after remaining under pressure for around two years the new government is supporting remittances arif habib limited deputy head of research tahir abbas told the express tribune in one such measure the government had let the rupee depreciate around 32 in the past 14 months to rs138 93 against the us dollar in the inter bank market on monday the measure was primarily taken to increase exports and cut imports in order to reduce the current account deficit however it also helped attract higher worker remittances besides the government has started a crackdown on the illegal hundi and hawala operators to give a push to inflows through legal channels including the banking system the government has recently introduced the m wallet scheme to build capacity for receiving remittances instantly it has also doubled the incentive to rs2 on the receipt of each dollar in remittances as airtime the incentives have been announced in recent months and have yet to make a fully favourable impact going forward they are expected to help the country attract higher remittances abbas said we have estimated remittances of 22 2 billion in fiscal year 2018 19 against the government target of 21 2 billion he said the government may further increase such incentives in order to step up the flow of remittances which will help it to efficiently manage external economic pressures he said an analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity said remittances from two western countries the us and the uk had continued to increase apparently because most of the pakistanis there were supporters of the pakistan tehreek einsaf government and prime minister imran khan the central bank has said that remittance inflows from the gulf cooperation council gcc particularly saudi arabia have grown in the recent past it is possible that layoffs in the region have gone down in recent months which may have led to the bottoming out of remittances from the gcc it remains to be seen if this trend reversal will continue going forward the sbp said remittance inflows have been under stress for the past couple of years since the first quarter of fy17 due to low oil prices and the gulf economies adoption of nationalisation policies and fiscal consolidation measures it said in january 2019 the inflows amounted to 1 74 billion which were 6 4 higher than january 2018 the sbp said country wise inflows country wise details for january 2019 showed that inflows from saudi arabia increased to 403 92 million compared to 383 91 million in january 2018 remittances from the uae inched up to 352 12 million compared to 351 58 million last year workers residing in the us sent 272 32 million compared to 223 94 million in the previous year from the uk sent 295 13 million compared to 235 1 million gcc countries including bahrain kuwait qatar and oman 166 5 million compared to 186 33 million and eu countries 42 89 million compared to 56 4 million remittances from malaysia norway switzerland australia canada japan and other countries in january 2019 amounted to 210 36 million against 201 46 million in january 2018
this release should be read with the company s financial statements and management discussion analysis md a available at www tasekomines com and filed on www sedar com except where otherwise noted all currency amounts are stated in canadian dollars taseko s 75 owned gibraltar mine is located north of the city of williams lake in south central british columbia production volumes stated in this release are on a 100 basis unless otherwise indicated vancouver feb 12 2019 cnw taseko mines limited tsx tko nyse american tgb taseko or the company reports financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ending december 31 2018 russell hallbauer president and ceo of taseko commented in 2018 gibraltar generated 149 million of earnings from mining operations before depletion and amortization on a 100 basis the copper price volatility over the year ranging from a high of us 3 25 to a low of us 2 60 per pound made it a challenging environment for many aspects of our business from mine planning to pricing as we tried to maximize operating margin and returns we expect as do many industry analysts increased copper prices in 2019 and a rebound in gross revenue and margins with global copper inventories at multi year lows and less scrap copper being used in the manufacture of final products combined with limited new production capacity the growing copper deficit will only result in higher prices mr hallbauer continued we are pleased with the performance of gibraltar but the focus of shareholders should be on our florence copper project with it now transitioning from a development project to an operating asset and continuing to advance as planned since we began operating the commercial scale wellfield we have been extremely pleased with the results the main focus of this phase is to demonstrate to the regulators and key stakeholders that we are able to maintain hydraulic control of the leach solutions underground all of the data gathered since we began injecting solutions indicate that copper mineralization is dissolving into copper solution as predicted with operations underway we have commenced detailed engineering and the process to finalize the commercial scale permits with the goal of commencing construction of the commercial plant as soon as possible the fourth quarter of 2018 was generally in line with our expectations for sales which came in at 43 million pounds of copper and 738 000 pounds of molybdenum 100 basis copper production was slightly lower than anticipated due to a series of minor operational issues particularly in december which were compounded by higher work index ore and lower grade stockpile feed we were able to ship most of the excess concentrate from the third quarter with copper inventory declining from 19 million pounds to two million pounds by year end mr hallbauer continued gibraltar is expected to produce approximately 130 million pounds 5 on a 100 basis in 2019 comparable to the level achieved in 2018 while there will be quarterly fluctuations in both copper and molybdenum production we do not anticipate those fluctuations to be as significant as last year even though we expect higher copper pricing in 2019 we have made a number of mine plan adjustments and spending curtailments to address the current weaker pricing environment added mr hallbauer mr hallbauer continued our acquisition of yellowhead mining is expected to close in the coming days as the transaction was approved by yellowhead shareholders at a special meeting held on february 8 2019 i cannot emphasize how enthused we are to have acquired this quality near shovel ready asset the intrinsic value of the yellowhead project to taseko has not been recognized by the investment community during the first seven years of operation the mill will process head grades of 0 32 cueq simplistically put the in situ ore value is approximately us 22 per tonne at the long term copper price with a cost per tonne milled expected to be below c 10 per tonne the mine site operating margin is approximately c 16 per tonne at present design capacity of 70 000 tonnes per day of throughput the yellowhead mine will generate roughly 400 million in operating margin a year and place it as one of the largest long life copper mines in canada as with all of our acquisitions of undervalued assets we believe our operating and engineering expertise can create substantial long term value based on yellowhead s 2014 technical report the project has a pre tax net present value in excess of c 1 billion or approximately 4 00 per taseko share we expect to unlock further value for our shareholders in the months ahead concluded mr hallbauer 2018 annual review earnings from mining operations before depletion and amortization was

throughput and recoveries were both slightly below targeted levels for the year copper recovery was 82 7 for the year due to lower head grades in the current year a total of 111 6 million tons were mined in 2018 a 20 increase over the prior year as waste stripping was increased to meet mine plan sequencing requirements waste stripping costs of 48 8 million 75 basis were capitalized in 2018 as a new pushback in the granite pit was initiated the ore stockpile tons remained relatively unchanged year over year site operating costs for the year were us 1 80 per pound of copper produced an

produced in 2017 total operating costs c1 were us 1 93 per pound of copper produced for the year fourth quarter results copper production in the fourth quarter was 25 8 million pounds production was affected by lower head grades and recovery in the quarter as a result of the metallurgical makeup of the ore and severe winter weather which impacted mining operations and ore access a total of 28 4 million tons were mined during the period the strip ratio for the fourth quarter of 5 1 to 1 was higher than recent quarters and above the life of mine average strip ratio of 1 9 to 1 mill feed was supplemented with 2 2 million tons of ore drawn from stockpile site operating cost per ton milled was 9 16 in the fourth quarter of 2018 total site spending including site operating costs and capitalized stripping costs in the fourth quarter was 5 lower than the previous quarter however site operating costs per pound produced increased to us 1 92 from us 1 50 in the previous quarter because of lower copper production molybdenum production was 0 7 million pounds in the fourth quarter a result of continued strong molybdenum plant operating performance by product credits per pound of copper produced increased to us 0 30 in the fourth quarter from us 0 16 in the previous quarter as molybdenum revenues increased in the quarter while copper production volumes dropped off property costs per pound produced were us 0 49 for the fourth quarter of 2018 which is higher than normal as a result of significantly higher copper sales volume during the current period the unusually high copper concentrate inventory at the end of the third quarter was sold in the fourth quarter off property costs per pound produced including transportation smelting and refining costs are higher in periods where sales volumes are higher than production volumes total operating costs c1 per pound were us 2 11 in the period and were impacted by lower copper production and higher than normal off property costs non gaap performance measure see end of news release operations analysis continued health safety and environment health and safety have always been a high level commitment for taseko gibraltar and florence management taseko is committed to operational practices that result in improved efficiencies safety performance and occupational health nothing is more important to the company than the safety health and well being of our workers and their families taseko places a high priority on the continuous improvement of performance in the areas of employee health and safety at the workplace and protection of the environment the gibraltar mine s 2018 results of zero loss time accidents and zero accidents that affected the environment are both a reflection of that priority and a reflection of the general standard of work at that site we do not have access to comparable data for environmental performance but gibraltar s zero loss time accidents is once again an industry leading performance in an industry that prides itself on their ability to have their employees come to work and then return home safely gibraltar received the province of british columbia ministry of energy and mines john ash award for the years 2015 2016 and 2017 and is in line to receive it again for 2018 this award goes to the mine in british columbia that has worked more than one million hours with the lowest injury frequency rate the same priority on health safety and environmental performance was exemplified during the construction of the florence copper ptf and the methods and culture at gibraltar are being imported and implemented as the ptf enters the operations phase gibraltar outlook gibraltar is expected to produce approximately 130 million pounds 5 on a 100 basis in 2019 comparable to the production level achieved in 2018 while there will be quarterly fluctuations in both copper and molybdenum production the company does not anticipate those fluctuations to be as significant as in 2018 the fundamentals for copper remain strong and most analysts are projecting a growing deficit and higher copper prices in the coming years review of projects taseko s strategy has been to grow the company by leveraging cash flow from the gibraltar mine to assemble and develop a pipeline of projects we continue to believe this will generate long term returns for shareholders our development projects are located in british columbia and arizona and represent a diverse range of metals including gold copper molybdenum and niobium our current focus is on the development of the florence copper project florence copper project construction of the production test facility ptf for the florence copper project progressed smoothly in 2018 and was completed on time and on budget wellfield operations commenced in the fourth quarter total expenditures at the florence project in 2018 were 36 5 million which includes ptf construction and operation and other project development costs review of projects continued the main focus of the ptf phase is to demonstrate to regulators and key stakeholders that hydraulic control of underground leach solutions can be maintained results to date are in line with management s expectations successful operation of the in situ leaching process will allow permits to be amended for the full scale operation which is expected to produce 85 million pounds of copper cathode per year the permit amendment process has started and it is anticipated that construction of the commercial scale operation could be commenced in the first half of 2020 aley niobium project environmental monitoring on the project continues and a number of product marketing initiatives are underway a drill program was completed in the third quarter of 2018 to collect samples for further metallurgical testing aley project expenditures were 2 7 million in 2018 yellowhead copper project on december 4 2018 the company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of yellowhead mining inc yellowhead that it did not already own in exchange for 17 3 million taseko common shares the transaction was structured as a plan of arrangement pursuant to the business corporations act british columbia and requires the approval of the supreme court of british columbia and yellowhead shareholders at a special meeting on february 8 2019 yellowhead shareholders voted to approve the acquisition and the transaction is expected to close in february yellowhead holds a 100 interest in a copper gold silver development project located in south central british columbia the project feasibility study dated july 31 2014 proposed a 70 000 tonne per day concentrator with total pre production capital costs of approximately 1 billion and an average operating cost of us 1 46 per pound of copper using us 3 00 per pound of copper a canadian us dollar exchange rate of 0 80 and an 8 discount rate results in a pre tax net present value of 1

frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the industry many of which present ebitda when reporting their results issuers of high yield securities also present ebitda because investors analysts and rating agencies consider it useful in measuring the ability of those issuers to meet debt service obligations the company believes ebitda is an appropriate supplemental measure of debt service capacity because cash expenditures on interest are by definition available to pay interest and tax expense is inversely correlated to interest expense because tax expense goes down as deductible interest expense goes up depreciation is a non cash charge adjusted ebitda is presented as a further supplemental measure of the company s

quarter and full year ending december 31 2018 russell hallbauer president and ceo of taseko commented in 2018 gibraltar generated 149 million of earnings from mining operations before depletion and amortization on a 100 basis the copper price volatility over the year ranging from a high of us 3 25 to a low of us 2 60 per pound made it a challenging environment for many aspects of our business from mine planning to pricing as we tried to maximize operating margin and returns we expect as do many industry analysts increased copper prices in 2019 and a rebound in gross revenue and margins with global copper inventories at multi year lows and less scrap copper being used in the manufacture of final products combined with limited new production capacity the growing copper deficit will only result in higher prices mr hallbauer continued we are pleased with the performance of gibraltar but the focus of shareholders should be on our florence copper project with it now transitioning from a development project to an operating asset and continuing to advance as planned since we began operating the commercial scale wellfield we have been extremely pleased with the results the main focus of this phase is to demonstrate to the regulators and key stakeholders that we are able to maintain hydraulic control of the leach solutions underground all of the data gathered since we began injecting solutions indicate that copper mineralization is dissolving into copper solution as predicted with operations underway we have commenced detailed engineering and the process to finalize the commercial scale permits with the goal of commencing construction of the commercial plant as soon as possible the fourth quarter of 2018 was generally in line with our expectations for sales which came in at 43 million pounds of copper and 738 000 pounds of molybdenum 100 basis copper production was slightly lower than anticipated due to a series of minor operational issues particularly in december which were compounded by higher work index ore and lower grade stockpile feed we were able to ship most of the excess concentrate from the third quarter with copper inventory declining from 19 million pounds to two million pounds by year end mr hallbauer continued gibraltar is expected to produce approximately 130 million pounds 5 on a 100 basis in 2019 comparable to the level achieved in 2018 while there will be quarterly fluctuations in both copper and molybdenum production we do not anticipate those fluctuations to be as significant as last year even though we expect higher copper pricing in 2019 we have made a number of mine plan adjustments and spending curtailments to address the current weaker pricing environment added mr hallbauer mr hallbauer continued our acquisition of yellowhead mining is expected to close in the coming days as the transaction was approved by yellowhead shareholders at a special meeting held on february 8 2019 i cannot emphasize how enthused we are to have acquired this quality near shovel ready asset the intrinsic value of the yellowhead project to taseko has not been recognized by the investment community during the first seven years of operation the mill will process head grades of 0 32 cueq simplistically put the in situ ore value is approximately us 22 per tonne at the long term copper price with a cost per tonne milled expected to be below c 10 per tonne the mine site operating margin is approximately c 16 per tonne at present design capacity of 70 000 tonnes per day of throughput the yellowhead mine will generate roughly 400 million in operating margin a year and place it as one of the largest long life copper mines in canada as with all of our acquisitions of undervalued assets we believe our operating and engineering expertise can create substantial long term value based on yellowhead s 2014 technical report the project has a pre tax net present value in excess of c 1 billion or approximately 4 00 per taseko share we expect to unlock further value for our shareholders in the months ahead concluded mr hallbauer 2018 annual review earnings from mining operations before depletion and amortization was

affected by lower head grades and recovery in the quarter as a result of the metallurgical makeup of the ore and severe winter weather which impacted mining operations and ore access a total of 28 4 million tons were mined during the period the strip ratio for the fourth quarter of 5 1 to 1 was higher than recent quarters and above the life of mine average strip ratio of 1 9 to 1 mill feed was supplemented with 2 2 million tons of ore drawn from stockpile site operating cost per ton milled was 9 16 in the fourth quarter of 2018 total site spending including site operating costs and capitalized stripping costs in the fourth quarter was 5 lower than the previous quarter however site operating costs per pound produced increased to us 1 92 from us 1 50 in the previous quarter because of lower copper production molybdenum production was 0 7 million pounds in the fourth quarter a result of continued strong molybdenum plant operating performance by product credits per pound of copper produced increased to us 0 30 in the fourth quarter from us 0 16 in the previous quarter as molybdenum revenues increased in the quarter while copper production volumes dropped off property costs per pound produced were us 0 49 for the fourth quarter of 2018 which is higher than normal as a result of significantly higher copper sales volume during the current period the unusually high copper concentrate inventory at the end of the third quarter was sold in the fourth quarter off property costs per pound produced including transportation smelting and refining costs are higher in periods where sales volumes are higher than production volumes total operating costs c1 per pound were us 2 11 in the period and were impacted by lower copper production and higher than normal off property costs non gaap performance measure see end of news release operations analysis continued health safety and environment health and safety have always been a high level commitment for taseko gibraltar and florence management taseko is committed to operational practices that result in improved efficiencies safety performance and occupational health nothing is more important to the company than the safety health and well being of our workers and their families taseko places a high priority on the continuous improvement of performance in the areas of employee health and safety at the workplace and protection of the environment the gibraltar mine s 2018 results of zero loss time accidents and zero accidents that affected the environment are both a reflection of that priority and a reflection of the general standard of work at that site we do not have access to comparable data for environmental performance but gibraltar s zero loss time accidents is once again an industry leading performance in an industry that prides itself on their ability to have their employees come to work and then return home safely gibraltar received the province of british columbia ministry of energy and mines john ash award for the years 2015 2016 and 2017 and is in line to receive it again for 2018 this award goes to the mine in british columbia that has worked more than one million hours with the lowest injury frequency rate the same priority on health safety and environmental performance was exemplified during the construction of the florence copper ptf and the methods and culture at gibraltar are being imported and implemented as the ptf enters the operations phase gibraltar outlook gibraltar is expected to produce approximately 130 million pounds 5 on a 100 basis in 2019 comparable to the production level achieved in 2018 while there will be quarterly fluctuations in both copper and molybdenum production the company does not anticipate those fluctuations to be as significant as in 2018 the fundamentals for copper remain strong and most analysts are projecting a growing deficit and higher copper prices in the coming years review of projects taseko s strategy has been to grow the company by leveraging cash flow from the gibraltar mine to assemble and develop a pipeline of projects we continue to believe this will generate long term returns for shareholders our development projects are located in british columbia and arizona and represent a diverse range of metals including gold copper molybdenum and niobium our current focus is on the development of the florence copper project florence copper project construction of the production test facility ptf for the florence copper project progressed smoothly in 2018 and was completed on time and on budget wellfield operations commenced in the fourth quarter total expenditures at the florence project in 2018 were 36 5 million which includes ptf construction and operation and other project development costs review of projects continued the main focus of the ptf phase is to demonstrate to regulators and key stakeholders that hydraulic control of underground leach solutions can be maintained results to date are in line with management s expectations successful operation of the in situ leaching process will allow permits to be amended for the full scale operation which is expected to produce 85 million pounds of copper cathode per year the permit amendment process has started and it is anticipated that construction of the commercial scale operation could be commenced in the first half of 2020 aley niobium project environmental monitoring on the project continues and a number of product marketing initiatives are underway a drill program was completed in the third quarter of 2018 to collect samples for further metallurgical testing aley project expenditures were 2 7 million in 2018 yellowhead copper project on december 4 2018 the company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of yellowhead mining inc yellowhead that it did not already own in exchange for 17 3 million taseko common shares the transaction was structured as a plan of arrangement pursuant to the business corporations act british columbia and requires the approval of the supreme court of british columbia and yellowhead shareholders at a special meeting on february 8 2019 yellowhead shareholders voted to approve the acquisition and the transaction is expected to close in february yellowhead holds a 100 interest in a copper gold silver development project located

frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the industry many of which present ebitda when reporting their results issuers of high yield securities also present ebitda because investors analysts and rating agencies consider it useful in measuring the ability of those issuers to meet debt service obligations the company believes ebitda is an appropriate supplemental measure of debt service capacity because cash expenditures on interest are by definition available to pay interest and tax expense is inversely correlated to

financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ending december 31 2018 russell hallbauer president and ceo of taseko commented in 2018 gibraltar generated 149 million of earnings from mining operations before depletion and amortization on a 100 basis the copper price volatility over the year ranging from a high of us 3 25 to a low of us 2 60 per pound made it a challenging environment for many aspects of our business from mine planning to pricing as we tried to maximize operating margin and returns we expect as do many industry analysts increased copper prices in 2019 and a rebound in gross revenue and margins with global copper inventories at multi year lows and less scrap copper being used in the manufacture of final products combined with limited new production capacity the growing copper deficit will only result in higher prices mr hallbauer continued we are pleased with the performance of gibraltar but the focus of shareholders should be on our florence copper project with it now transitioning from a development project to an operating asset and continuing to advance as planned since we began operating the commercial scale wellfield we have been extremely pleased with the results the main focus of this phase is to demonstrate to the regulators and key stakeholders that we are able to maintain hydraulic control of the leach solutions underground all of the data gathered since we began injecting solutions indicate that copper mineralization is dissolving into copper solution as predicted with operations underway we have commenced detailed engineering and the process to finalize the commercial scale permits with the goal of commencing construction of the commercial plant as soon as possible the fourth quarter of 2018 was generally in line with our expectations for sales which came in at 43 million pounds of copper and 738 000 pounds of molybdenum 100 basis copper production was slightly lower than anticipated due to a series of minor operational issues particularly in december which were compounded by higher work index ore and lower grade stockpile feed we were able to ship most of the excess concentrate from the third quarter with copper inventory declining from 19 million pounds to two million pounds by year end mr hallbauer continued gibraltar is expected to produce approximately 130 million pounds 5 on a 100 basis in 2019 comparable to the level achieved in 2018 while there will be quarterly fluctuations in both copper and molybdenum production we do not anticipate those fluctuations to be as significant as last year even though we expect higher copper pricing in 2019 we have made a number of mine plan adjustments and spending curtailments to address the current weaker pricing environment added mr hallbauer mr hallbauer continued our acquisition of yellowhead mining is expected to close in the coming days as the transaction was approved by yellowhead shareholders at a special meeting held on february 8 2019 i cannot emphasize how enthused we are to have acquired this quality near shovel ready asset the intrinsic value of the yellowhead project to taseko has not been recognized by the investment community during the first seven years of operation the mill will process head grades of 0 32 cueq simplistically put the in situ ore value is approximately us 22 per tonne at the long term copper price with a cost per tonne milled expected to be below c 10 per tonne the mine site operating margin is approximately c 16 per tonne at present design capacity of 70 000 tonnes per day of throughput the yellowhead mine will generate roughly 400 million in operating margin a year and place it as one of the largest long life copper mines in canada as with all of our acquisitions of undervalued assets we believe our operating and engineering expertise can create substantial long term value based on yellowhead s 2014 technical report the project has a pre tax net present value in excess of c 1 billion or approximately 4 00 per taseko share we expect to unlock further value for our shareholders in the months ahead concluded mr hallbauer 2018 annual review fourth quarter review non gaap

capitalized stripping costs in the fourth quarter was 5 lower than the previous quarter however site operating costs per pound produced increased to us 1 92 from us 1 50 in the previous quarter because of lower copper production molybdenum production was 0 7 million pounds in the fourth quarter a result of continued strong molybdenum plant operating performance by product credits per pound

costs per pound produced were us 0 49 for the fourth quarter of 2018 which is higher than normal as a result of significantly higher copper sales volume during the current period the unusually high

gibraltar and florence management taseko is committed to operational practices that result in improved efficiencies safety performance and occupational health nothing is more important to the company than the safety health and well being of our workers and their families taseko places a high priority on the continuous improvement of performance in the areas of employee health and safety at the workplace and protection of the environment the gibraltar mine s 2018 results of zero loss time accidents and zero accidents that affected the environment are both a reflection of that priority and a reflection of the general standard of work at that site we do not have access to comparable data for environmental performance but gibraltar s zero loss time accidents is once again an industry leading performance in an industry that prides itself on their ability to have their employees come to work and then return home safely gibraltar received the province of british columbia ministry of energy and mines john ash award for the years 2015 2016 and 2017 and is in line to receive it again for 2018 this award goes to the mine in british columbia that has worked more than one million hours with the lowest injury frequency rate the same priority on health safety and environmental performance was exemplified during the construction of the florence copper ptf and the methods and culture at gibraltar are being imported and implemented as the ptf enters the operations phase gibraltar outlook gibraltar is expected to produce approximately 130 million pounds 5 on a 100 basis in 2019 comparable to the production level achieved in 2018 while there will be quarterly fluctuations in both copper and molybdenum production the company does not anticipate those fluctuations to be as significant as in 2018 the fundamentals for copper remain strong and most analysts are projecting a growing deficit and higher copper prices in the coming years review of projects taseko s strategy has been to grow the company by leveraging cash flow from the gibraltar mine to assemble and develop a pipeline of projects we continue to believe this will generate long term returns for shareholders our development projects are located in british columbia and arizona and represent a diverse range of metals including gold copper molybdenum and niobium our current focus is on the development of the florence copper project florence copper project construction of the production test facility ptf for the florence copper project progressed smoothly in 2018 and was completed on time and on budget wellfield operations commenced in the fourth quarter total expenditures at the florence project in 2018 were 36 5 million which includes ptf construction and operation and other project development costs review of projects continued the main focus of the ptf phase is to demonstrate to regulators and key stakeholders that hydraulic control of underground leach solutions can be maintained results to date are in line with management s expectations successful operation of the in situ leaching process will allow permits to be amended for the full scale operation which is expected to produce 85 million pounds of copper cathode per year the permit amendment process has started and it is anticipated that construction of the commercial scale operation could be commenced in the first half of 2020 aley niobium project environmental monitoring on the project continues and a number of product marketing initiatives are underway a drill program was completed in the third quarter of 2018 to

frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the industry many of which present ebitda when reporting their results issuers of high yield securities also present ebitda because investors analysts and rating agencies consider it useful in measuring the ability of those issuers to meet debt service obligations the company believes ebitda is an appropriate supplemental measure of debt service capacity because cash expenditures on interest are by definition available to pay interest and tax expense is inversely correlated to interest expense because tax expense goes down as deductible interest expense goes up depreciation is a non cash charge adjusted ebitda is presented as a further supplemental measure of the company s performance and ability to service debt adjusted ebitda is prepared by adjusting ebitda to eliminate the impact of a number of items that are not considered indicative of ongoing operating performance adjusted ebitda is calculated by adding to ebitda certain items of expense and deducting from ebitda certain items of income that are not likely to recur or are not indicative of the company s future

wakefield mass business wire franklin street properties corp the company fsp we or our nyse american fsp a real estate investment trust reit announced its results for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2018 george j carter chairman and chief executive officer commented as follows leasing activity within our property portfolio of 32 operating and 3 redevelopment properties continued to be solid during the fourth quarter of 2018 with approximately 398 000 square feet leased during the quarter this leasing activity contributed to making 2018 a record year of leasing at fsp with approximately 1 681 000 square feet leased during the year we also continued to see increased leasing activity in our energy influenced markets of houston and denver the price of oil was particularly volatile over the past quarter and we believe that longer term supply demand pricing characteristics of that commodity will be an important factor affecting future levels of office space absorption in those markets during 2019 and 2020 as anticipated we did experience known and planned for tenant move outs during the fourth quarter of 2018 including burger king at blue lagoon in miami florida suntrust at innsbrook in glen allen virginia and red cross at forest park in charlotte north carolina which reduced overall leased occupancy in our property portfolio as 2019 begins we are continuing our lease up efforts at our approximately 130 000 square foot redevelopment property known as 801 marquette in minneapolis minnesota which was approximately 37 leased as of december 31 2018 in addition we are now redeveloping an approximately 213 000 square foot property known as blue lagoon in miami florida and an approximately 62 000 square foot property known as forest park in charlotte north carolina for a total of approximately 400 000 square feet of redevelopment space in the aggregate similar to 801 marquette prior to beginning our redevelopment efforts both blue lagoon and forest park had been long term leased to single tenants in addition both assets have been owned by us or our affiliates for in excess of 15 years are anchored in excellent locations within their respective markets and have generated consistently strong cash flows we believe that current market rents for these assets are meaningfully higher than the expiring single tenant rents we also believe that our redevelopment efforts will provide us the opportunity to capture significant increased value for our shareholders through higher ongoing rental cash flows as we seek to achieve a strong long term rate of return on our costs of redevelopment currently these 3 redevelopment properties contribute no material rental income to the company as 2019 begins we are optimistic about our ability to lease significant portions of our vacancy in our 32 operating properties and in our 3 redevelopment properties and believe that successful results will mark the beginning of a longer term more sustainable rise in operating performance and value creation within our property portfolio in 2020 the reduction to our dividend in 2018 allows the company to retain more operating cash flow to fund anticipated increased leasing costs and capital expenditures during 2019 and 2020 highlights net income was 1 4 million and 13 1 million or 0 01 and 0 12 per basic and diluted share for the fourth

one thing that is protecting us from a recession is that although we are talking about higher tariffs they are rising from a record low level she said even if they double the tariffs they will still come nowhere close to our historical experience tariff hikes from its trade war with china are unlikely to tip its economy into recession as long as its trading volume keeps growing she said the previous longest us expansion was 120 months long between march 1991 and march 2001 by july the current economic upcycle will have lasted 121 months the united states the world s largest economy is poised to see its longest period of economic growth since 1785 if there is no recession through july this year according to marie owens thomsen global head of investment intelligence at indosuez wealth management the private banking arm of french financial services firm credit agricole group in 2017 tariffs amounted to just 1 per cent of all imports to the us and 5 per cent of its dutiable imports far lower than an average of 60 per cent in the early 1930s when the us suffered from a long and deep economic depression global trade volume growth slowed from 4 per cent in 2017 to an estimated 2 per cent last year said the economist who also forecast global economic growth to decelerate to 3 2 per cent this year and 3 per cent next year from 3 4 per cent in 2018 and 3 6 per cent in 2017 owens thomsen s comments stand in contrast with those of nobel prize winning economist paul krugman who on sunday told bloomberg tv that the us seems pretty likely to see a recession in the next two years a view shared by most us chief financial officers in a duke university survey published in december 2018 krugman said lack of consumption in china and weak growth in europe were the biggest risks to the global economy italy the third largest economy in the euro zone slipped into recession in the final three months of last year owens thomsen said the broad macroeconomic environment was still supportive of continued global growth and that the sharp correction in equity markets late last year did not reflect that surrounding the growth figures we also have very low interest and inflation rates the price actions we saw in december were very divorced from macroeconomic reality and that s why were still reasonably positive at the time and we also have a reasonably positive outlook for this year she said she expects the us federal reserve to raise interest rates twice more this year after its surprise comment last month that it will not raise interest rates for at least a while in a sweeping change from a bias towards tighter monetary policy the us economy is still expanding just at a lower pace and inflation has been and probably will be over target she said as long as inflation is over the 2 per cent target they must have a tightening bias marie owens thomsen global head of investment intelligence at indosuez wealth management photo handout ate hike is more likely to be needed if the us dollar depreciates against other currencies added owens thomsen noting that an appreciation in the us dollar had a similar effect on the economy as a rate hike meanwhile she said it was hard to be bullish on the yuan given that china s current account surplus has fallen to zero but beijing will not let it become too weak to avoid capital outflows which would destabilise its economy many people have overinvested in the us market and should probably consider shifting more investment into emerging markets and safe haven assets she added this article appeared in the south china morning post print edition as us poised for longest period of growth since 1785

currency amounts are stated in canadian dollars taseko s 75 owned gibraltar mine is located north of the city of williams lake in south central british columbia production volumes stated in this release are on a 100 basis unless otherwise indicated vancouver feb 12 2019 prnewswire taseko mines limited tsx tko nyse american tgb taseko or the company reports financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ending december 31 2018 russell hallbauer president and ceo of taseko commented in 2018 gibraltar generated 149 million of earnings from mining operations before depletion and amortization on a 100 basis the copper price volatility over the year ranging from a high of us 3 25 to a low of us 2 60 per pound made it a challenging environment for many aspects of our business from mine planning to pricing as we tried to maximize operating margin and returns we expect as do many industry analysts increased copper prices in 2019 and a rebound in gross revenue and margins with global copper inventories at multi year lows and less scrap copper being used in the manufacture of final products combined with limited new production capacity the growing copper deficit will only result in higher prices mr hallbauer continued we are pleased with the performance of gibraltar but the focus of shareholders should be on our florence copper project with it now transitioning from a development project to an operating asset and continuing to advance as planned since we began operating the commercial scale wellfield we have been extremely pleased with the results the main focus of this phase is to demonstrate to the regulators and key stakeholders that we are able to maintain hydraulic control of the leach solutions underground all of the data gathered since we began injecting solutions indicate that copper mineralization is dissolving into copper solution as predicted with operations underway we have commenced detailed engineering and the process to finalize the commercial scale permits with the goal of commencing construction of the commercial plant as soon as possible the fourth quarter of 2018 was generally in line with our expectations for sales which came in at 43 million pounds of copper and 738 000 pounds of molybdenum 100 basis copper production was slightly lower than anticipated due to a series of minor operational issues particularly in december which were compounded by higher work index ore and lower grade stockpile feed we were able to ship most of the excess concentrate from the third quarter with copper inventory declining from 19 million pounds to two million pounds by year end mr hallbauer continued gibraltar is expected to produce approximately 130 million pounds 5 on a 100 basis in 2019 comparable to the level achieved in 2018 while there will be quarterly fluctuations in both copper and molybdenum production we do not anticipate those fluctuations to be as significant as last year even though we expect higher copper pricing in 2019 we have made a number of mine plan adjustments and spending curtailments to address the current weaker pricing environment added mr hallbauer mr hallbauer continued our acquisition of yellowhead mining is expected to close in the coming days as the transaction was approved by yellowhead shareholders at a special meeting held on february 8 2019 i cannot emphasize how enthused we are to have acquired this quality near shovel ready asset the intrinsic value of the yellowhead project to taseko has not been recognized by the investment community during the first seven years of operation the mill will process head grades of 0 32 cueq simplistically put the in situ ore value is approximately us 22 per tonne at the long term copper price with a cost per tonne milled expected to be below c 10 per tonne the mine site operating margin is approximately c 16 per tonne at present design capacity of 70 000 tonnes per day of throughput the yellowhead mine will generate roughly 400 million in operating margin a year and place it as one of the largest long life copper mines in canada as with all of our acquisitions of undervalued assets we believe our operating and engineering expertise can create substantial long term value based on yellowhead s 2014 technical report the project has a pre tax net present value in excess of c 1 billion or approximately 4 00 per taseko share we expect to unlock further value for our shareholders in the months ahead concluded mr hallbauer 2018 annual review earnings from mining operations before depletion and amortization was

produced in 2017 total operating costs c1 were us 1 93 per pound of copper produced for the year fourth quarter results copper production in the fourth quarter was 25 8 million pounds production was affected by lower head grades and recovery in the quarter as a result of the metallurgical makeup of the ore and severe winter weather which impacted mining operations and ore access a total of 28 4 million tons were mined during the period the strip ratio for the fourth quarter of 5 1 to 1 was higher than recent quarters and above the life of mine average strip ratio of 1 9 to 1 mill feed was supplemented with 2 2 million tons of ore drawn from stockpile site operating cost per ton milled was 9 16 in the fourth quarter of 2018 total site spending including site operating costs and capitalized stripping costs in the fourth quarter was 5 lower than the previous quarter however site operating costs per pound produced increased to us 1 92 from us 1 50 in the previous quarter because of lower copper production molybdenum production was 0 7 million pounds in the fourth quarter a result of continued strong molybdenum plant operating performance by product credits per pound of copper produced increased to us 0 30 in the fourth quarter from us 0 16 in the previous quarter as molybdenum revenues increased in the quarter while copper production volumes dropped off property costs per pound produced were us 0 49 for the fourth quarter of 2018 which is higher than normal as a result of significantly higher copper sales volume during the current period the unusually high copper concentrate inventory at the end of the third quarter was sold in the fourth quarter off property costs per pound produced including transportation smelting and refining costs are higher in periods where sales volumes are higher than production volumes total operating costs c1 per pound were us 2 11 in the period and were impacted by lower copper production and higher than normal off property costs non gaap performance measure see end of news release operations analysis continued health safety and environment health and safety have always been a high level commitment for taseko gibraltar and florence management taseko is committed to operational practices that result in improved efficiencies safety performance and occupational health nothing is more important to the company than the safety health and well being of our workers and their families taseko places a high priority on the continuous improvement of performance in the areas of employee health and safety at the workplace and protection of the environment the gibraltar mine s 2018 results of zero loss time accidents and zero accidents that affected the environment are both a reflection of that priority and a reflection of the general standard of work at that site we do not have access to comparable data for environmental performance but gibraltar s zero loss time accidents is once again an industry leading performance in an industry that prides itself on their ability to have their employees come to work and then return home safely gibraltar received the province of british columbia ministry of energy and mines john ash award for the years 2015 2016 and 2017 and is in line to receive it again for 2018 this award goes to the mine in british columbia that has worked more than one million hours with the lowest injury frequency rate the same priority on health safety and environmental performance was exemplified during the construction of the florence copper ptf and the methods and culture at gibraltar are being imported and implemented as the ptf enters the operations phase gibraltar outlook gibraltar is expected to produce approximately 130 million pounds 5 on a 100 basis in 2019 comparable to the production level achieved in 2018 while there will be quarterly fluctuations in both copper and molybdenum production the company does not anticipate those fluctuations to be as significant as in 2018 the fundamentals for copper remain strong and most analysts are projecting a growing deficit and higher copper prices in the coming years review of projects taseko s strategy has been to grow the company by leveraging cash flow from the gibraltar mine to assemble and develop a pipeline of projects we continue to believe this will generate long term returns for shareholders our development projects are located in british columbia and arizona and represent a diverse range of metals including gold copper molybdenum and niobium our current focus is on the development of the florence copper project florence copper project construction of the production test facility ptf for the florence copper project progressed smoothly in 2018 and was completed on time and on budget wellfield operations commenced in the fourth quarter total expenditures at the florence project in 2018 were 36 5 million which includes ptf construction and operation and other project development costs review of projects continued the main focus of the ptf phase is to demonstrate to regulators and key stakeholders that hydraulic control of underground leach solutions can be maintained results to date are in line with management s expectations successful operation of the in situ leaching process will allow permits to be amended for the full scale operation which is expected to produce 85 million pounds of copper cathode per year the permit amendment process has started and it is anticipated that construction of the commercial scale operation could be commenced in the first half of 2020 aley niobium project environmental monitoring on the project continues and a number of product marketing initiatives are underway a drill program was completed in the third quarter of 2018 to collect samples for further metallurgical testing aley project expenditures were 2 7 million in 2018 yellowhead copper project on december 4 2018 the company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of yellowhead mining inc yellowhead that it did not already own in exchange for 17 3 million taseko common shares the transaction was structured as a plan of arrangement pursuant to the business corporations act british columbia and requires the approval of the supreme court of british columbia and yellowhead shareholders at a special meeting on february 8 2019 yellowhead shareholders voted to approve the acquisition and the transaction is expected to close in february yellowhead holds a 100 interest in a copper gold silver development project located in south central british columbia the project feasibility study dated july 31 2014 proposed a 70 000 tonne per day concentrator with total pre production capital costs of approximately 1 billion and an average operating cost of us 1 46 per pound of copper using us 3 00 per pound of copper a canadian us dollar exchange rate of 0 80 and an 8 discount rate results in a pre tax net present value of 1

frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the industry many of which present ebitda when reporting their results issuers of high yield securities also present ebitda because investors analysts and rating agencies consider it useful in measuring the ability of those issuers to meet debt service obligations the company believes ebitda is an appropriate supplemental measure of debt service capacity because cash expenditures on interest are by definition available to pay interest and tax expense is inversely correlated to

sandip sabharwal the year 2019 started exactly i thought it should start in the global context with a bounce back in the us markets and revival in emerging markets ems driven by low valuations and increasingly dovish outlook from most of central banks story continues below advertisement remove ad however india has underperformed significantly during this period as benchmark indices are absolutely flat on ytd basis when the emerging market index is up 8 percent in the same time period such underperformance and lack of correlation are very rare we need to evaluate the reasons and the way forward here are a few reasons that are relevant 1 indian markets never crashed the way some other ems did and as such the valuation gap between india and the em basket was high this has led to more flows into other markets 2 a series of corporate governance issues related to groups like dhfl essel group vedanta adag in quick succession and slow pace of resolution of the il fs debt issue 3 very high real rates in india relative to rest of the world where most large economies today have negative or low real rates and in india the real rate is almost 3 4 a mixed set of corporate results mainly due to squeeze in margins as raw material prices shot up suddenly last year and could not be passed on and story continues below advertisement remove ad 5 election related uncertainty which is playing in the minds of people and potential investors there has been an unprecedented sell off in the broader markets even as largecap indices have held up the actual impact on most portfolios is much more negative than what the indices reflect in my view this period of uncertainly is one of the best for long term investing as stocks are available cheap and even high quality companies in the mid sized category have seen a significant dent in valuations the union budget was positive for the economy many things can only be implemented post the full budget however whatever has been announced is positive for consumption growth as the farm waiver will put rs 75 000 crore into bank accounts which will be immediately consumed all you need to understand is that any tax break or break to corporates normally ends up having a saving and spending element however since this is at the bottom of the pyramid it will be fully consumed the middle class tax break is also positive for consumption besides this there were several measures for the real estate sector other than that there was nothing major except for a statement of intent which does not carry much weight till the new government is formed overall it was positive for consumer durables non durables autos housing etc this was followed by the monetary policy which rightly was dovish many people just want to blame the government but mpc has been excessively hawkish even as inflation kept on plummeting ideally they should have cut rate by 50bps for an immediate cut in market rates commodity prices have also fallen substantially and crude is also down 30 percent from the peak of three months back the extended winter is expected to keep food prices lower for longer and thus have a positive impact on retail inflation as is always the case in the run up to the elections there is some slowdown in investment demand as order flow reduces and implementation slows down however this is just temporary as underlying growth trends continue to be positive in conclusion we are currently at a stage where economic growth is likely to remain strong in india margins pressures are likely to come off and growth outlook improve historical evidence of post election performance from india as well as other markets reflects that d street always does well after elections irrespective of the disposition at the centre a recent example of this is from brazil where markets are up nearly 40 percent from where they were two months prior to the elections the reforms that have been carried out including rera gst ibc etc will also have a far reaching positive impact on the performance and efficiency of the economy most banks have started reflecting improved balance sheets which is critical for liquidity flow into the economy with easier monetary policy likely in the usa and eurozone we will see a resurgence of emerging markets performance we have just seen an initial move and we should still see a substantial upmove the spanner in the works could be a breakdown of us china trade talks but given the huge investment by both sides into the process there should be some resolution if not complete under the circumstances the current underperformance of india is likely to be temporary rather than permanent consumer goods autos cement as well as select mid caps across sectors present good investment opportunities remember exactly a year back there was euphoria but buying at that time did not make money today there is lack of conviction and such times are best to invest markets are more likely to follow global cues where we have seen a huge underperformance by india which can get corrected via a post budget rally in february overall outlook for risky assets globally is positive with the us fed easing out on rate hikes ecb indicating easy policy for some more time and china also adding stimulus in india interest rates continue to be too high relative to global rates and thus we see lack of competitiveness across sectors except cash rich ones this needs to be corrected and keeps the potential growth rate at least 1 2 percent lower than what can be achieved we have also recently seen some issues related to corporate governance where stocks have got sold out however this is more likely to be isolated rather than a systematic risk the dhfl episode has impacted sentiments negatively across the mid cap universe the results season has been quite positive with good delivery across sectors some sectors like autos have seen a slowdown and margin squeeze which should get corrected going forward overall outlook remains good there could be volatility ahead of elections however the full year should be good and we need to use sell offs to buy good potential

new york much of president donald trump s state of the union address was devoted to describing the menaces he claims face america mainly the menace of scary brown people but also the menace of socialism new york much of president donald trump s state of the union address was devoted to describing the menaces he claims face america mainly the menace of scary brown people but also the menace of socialism and there has been a lot of discussion in the news media of what he said about those topics advertising there has however been little coverage of one of the most revealing aspects of the sotu what trump said about the menace of america s historically large government debt but wait you may object he didn t say anything about debt indeed he didn t not one word but that s what was so revealing after all republicans spent the entire obama administration inveighing constantly about the dangers of debt warning that america faced a looming crisis unless deficits were drastically reduced now that they re in power however and with the deficit surging thanks to a huge tax cut for corporations and the rich they ve totally dropped the subject according to abc news mick mulvaney trump s acting chief of staff explained to gop members of congress why debt wouldn t get a single mention in the sotu nobody cares and you know he s kind of right it s not just republicans who suddenly seemed to stop caring about debt for years deficit scolds dominated discourse inside the beltway much of the news media treated the urgency of fiscal austerity as an unquestioned fact abandoning the usual rules of reportorial neutrality and plunging into outright advocacy yet since trump s election those voices have become oddly muted what we ve just seen confirmed then is what some of us were trying to tell you from the beginning all that wailing about debt was hypocritical republicans never actually cared about debt they just pretended to be deficit hawks as a way to hamstring president barack obama s agenda and many centrists have turned out to have a double standard reserving passionate concern about debt for times when democrats hold power but while the about face on debt has as i said been deeply revealing there are still two big questions first how much should we care about debt second will a double standard continue to prevail that is will the deficit scolds suddenly get vocal again if and when democrats regain power on the first question one surprising thing about the debt obsession that peaked around 2011 is that it never had much basis in economic analysis on the contrary everything we know about fiscal policy says that it s a mistake to focus on deficit reduction when unemployment is high and interest rates are low as they were when the fiscal scolds were at their loudest the case for worrying about debt is stronger now given low unemployment but interest rates are still very low by historical standards less than 1 percent after adjusting for inflation this is so low that we needn t fear that debt will snowball with interest payments blowing up the deficit it also suggests that we re suffering from chronic weakness in private investment demand which by the way the 2017 tax cut doesn t seem to have boosted at all so in the past few months a number of prominent economists including the former chief economist of the international monetary fund and top economists from the obama administration have published analyses saying that even now with unemployment quite low debt is much less of a problem than previously thought it s still a bad idea to run up debt for no good reason say to provide tax breaks that corporations just use to buy back their own stock which is of course what the gop did but borrowing at ultralow interest rates to pay for investments in the future infrastructure of course but also things like nutrition and health care for the young who are the workers of tomorrow is very defensible which brings us to the question of double standards you don t have to agree with everything in proposals for a green new deal to acknowledge that it s very much an investment program not a mere giveaway so it has been very dismaying to see how much commentary on these proposals either demands an immediate detailed explanation of how democrats would pay for their ideas or dismisses the whole thing as impractical was there the same pushback against republican tax cuts no look we ve seen this over and over again three times since 1980 republicans rail against budget deficits when they re out of power then drop all their concerns and send the deficit soaring once they are in a position to cut taxes then when it s the democrats turn they re expected to clean up the republicans red ink rather than address their own priorities enough already i m not saying that democrats should completely ignore the fiscal implications of their actions really big spending plans especially if they don t clearly involve investment for example a major expansion of federal health spending will have to be paid for with new taxes but if and when democrats are in a position to make policy they should be ambitious and not let the deficit scolds scare them into thinking small paul krugman is a syndicated columnist who writes for the new york times news service
in the postwar era the multilateral development banks were created to facilitate global trade today they are america first targets recently the white house has been pushing its america first stance in the world trade organization wto by controversial appeals to a national security exception in response to the trump tariffs several wto members have brought dispute settlement cases against the u s world bank is next in the firing line reportedly the white house will announce david malpass as the nominee for president of the world bank after jim yong kim s resignation well before the end of his five year term in 2022 in the 2016 election malpass served as trump s economic advisor a year later he was appointed undersecretary for international affairs in the u s department of the treasury but he is an odd choice to head the world bank a bit like selecting a coal ceo to head the struggle against climate change an america first world bank like u s representative of trade robert lighthizer malpass began his political career in the 1980s reagan administration seeking to contain the rise of japan through the section 301 of the 1974 trade act the same unilateral legislation trump is exploiting against china in the current trade dispute during his 15 years as chief economist at bear stearns malpass was not known for his economic foresight a year before the global crisis he wrote that housing and debt market corrections will probably add to the length of the u s economic expansion and amidst lingering crisis he urged for higher interest rates during his tenure as under secretary of the treasury for international affairs malpass has taken an aggressive position against china in early 2018 he slammed china s non market behavior advocating stronger responses when trump tariff wars began some 20 career staff quit malpass s unit in less than a year opposing the administration s unilateral trade policies and malpass s poor leadership style to malpass the world bank is a giant sprawl of international organizations that create mountains of debt without solving problems he promotes a new debt transparency initiative that would shed more light on the international liabilities of the world s governments such an initiative would not target america s 22 trillion pile of sovereign debt but china s belt and road initiative bri should he walk the talk that could cause a fatal rift in world bank as of november 2018 the largest recipients of world bank loans were india 859 million in 2018 and china 370 million in 2018 malpass could subject china and its loans into a politicized scrutiny effectively extending u s investment reviews through the bank in that view his nomination has done nothing to diminish china s concerns that the existing international institutions will not accommodate it toward america first imf since the bretton woods the president of the world bank has been an american while the international monetary fund imf has been led by a european both institutions are located in washington d c and work closely with each other as international extensions of the u s department of the treasury as critics contend amid the 2008 crisis fall imf chief dominique strauss kahn managed to achieve g20 cooperation that contained the global free fall in exchange advanced economies pledged commitment to global governance reforms in multilateral development banks yet those reforms were ignored after strauss kahn was replaced with french finance minister christine lagarde as global managing partner of u s headquartered baker mckenzie lagarde lived full time in chicago until 2005 through the nomination process she was subject of a legal investigation over alleged abuse of power in the tapie affair in 2016 a french court found her guilty of negligence but did not impose a penalty that s how lagarde was re appointed for another five year term at imf imf s economic stance is shifting toward washington as well recently lagarde appointed gina gopinath as the imf chief economist to succeed maurice obstfeld gopinath is a veteran u s economist and co director at national bureau of economic research in her most recent work she has been an outspoken advocate of the u s dollar whose dominance she expects to continue largely undisturbed she has cooperated with former imf economic counselor kenneth rogoff who has for years criticized china s debt as opposed to u s debt as a global risk since 2011 brics economies brazil russia india china and south africa have stressed that the selection of the imf chief on the basis of nationality undermines its international legitimacy in a 2015 interview even jim yong kim predicted that you will never again see an imf or a world bank election without very strong contention coming especially from the developing world despite the 2010 cosmetic reforms advanced economies continue to dominate world bank voting shares over emerging economies today the seven major advanced economies account for 45 and the largest seven emerging economies almost 30 of the world economy nevertheless advanced countries still control nearly 40 of world bank voting shares as opposed to only 9 to 15 by emerging economies figure figure advanced and emerging economies economic versus voting power nominal gdp 2019 voting power 2019 ibrd ida world bank red the share of seven largest emerging economies of total votes blue the share of seven largest advanced economies of total vote the world bank comprises the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd which provides loans to middle income economies and the international development association ida which targets low income economies there is a gap between the economic share of emerging economies and their voice in the international community and the gap is deepening since emerging economies are growing relatively faster their economic share will exceed that of advanced economies within a decade or two from reforms to retrenchment since the early 2010s china has been promoting the huge multi decade belt and road initiative bri which seeks to energize industrialization and modernization in many large emerging and developing economies the obama administration took a skeptical view of the initiative which the trump administration has branded as a national security risk to america in october 2013 china proposed creating a new multilateral development bank the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib in the obama era the white house stayed out of the aiib and tried but failed to prevent its partners and allies from joining the bank a year later brazil russia india china and south africa launched the new development bank ndb to accelerate lending on infrastructure projects the obama white house sought to marginalize it while the trump administration sees cooperative activities with potential eurasian hegemons as a national security risk as the world bank may face a divisive political struggle u s interests are growing more prominent at the imf while the wto has been targeted by trade hawks attempts by emerging and developing economies to help themselves are shunned as security threats to american interests meanwhile the west s multilateral development banks are bailing out rich european economies targeting poorer ones and sanctioning those that oppose washington s unilateralism the gap between the multipolar 21st century world economy and aging west which created its prosperity through colonial plunder in the 19th century is progressively deepening that serves neither america s

in 1972 the socialist left swept to power in jamaica calling for the strengthening of workers rights the nationalization of industries and the expansion of the island s welfare state the people s national party pnp led by the charismatic michael manley sought nothing less than to overturn the old order under which jamaicans had long labored first as enslaved then indentured then colonized and only recently as politically free of great britain jamaica is a small island but the ambition of the project was global in scale two years before his election as prime minister manley took to the pages of foreign affairs to situate his democratic socialism within a novel account of international relations while the largely north atlantic readers of the magazine might have identified the fissures of the cold war as the dominant conflict of their time manley argued otherwise the real battleground he declared was located in that largely tropical territory which was first the object of colonial exploitation second the focus of non caucasian nationalism and more latterly known as the underdeveloped and the developing world as it sought euphemisms for its condition manley displaced the cold war s east west divide instead drawing on a longstanding anti colonial critique to look at the world along its north south axis when viewed from the tropics the world was not bifurcated by ideology but by a global economy whose origins lay in the project of european imperial expansion the sovereignty of former colonies was undermined by their economic dependence on former colonial powers a condition kwame nkrumah called neocolonialism imperialism for manley was a form of not just political but economic domination through which territories such as jamaica were geared to produce not what was needed for themselves or for exchange for mutual advantage but rather compelled to be the producers of what others needed between the 1940s and 60s the first generation of anti colonial nationalists including norman manley michael s father had largely liberated their countries from the political chains of empire by securing independence anti colonial nationalists aspired to use their newfound sovereignty to transform the political and economic legacies of imperialism as a member of the second generation of postwar nationalists manley viewed his election as an opportunity to realize this aspiration for postcolonial transformation given the condition of a newly independent society encumbered with the economic social and psychological consequences of three hundred years of colonialism manley hoped his political program would secure individual and collective self reliance as well as political and economic equality his platform of democratic socialism for jamaica inaugurated an ambitious project of land redistribution state control of key industries stronger rights for organized labor worker ownership of industries and the expansion of health care and education however this vision of postcolonial transformation was limited by the very forms of dependence and inequality that it sought to overcome because postcolonial states remained primary good exporters with national economies dependent on products such as bauxite cocoa coffee cotton sisal and tea their domestic economic policies were subject to the vagaries of the international market this contradiction between the achievement of political sovereignty and the persistence of economic dependence famously captured in kwame nkrumah s term neocolonialism was heightened as manley inaugurated his socialist project already beginning in the late 1960s prices for primary products in international markets experienced a precipitous decline coupled with opec s 1973 oil embargo which heavily burdened new postcolonial states dependent on oil imports the decline in commodity prices resulted in steep foreign exchange shortages and exacerbated postcolonial states reliance on debt the end of this story is a familiar one by the 1980s unable to service their debt postcolonial states entered structural adjustment agreements with the world bank and international monetary fund imf while mexico s 1982 default is often viewed as the beginning of this process manley s jamaica was the first victim of the third world debt crisis and began structural adjustment in 1977 then in his second term manley acceded to the terms of the imf s stabilization program which required a 30 percent devaluation of jamaica s currency major cuts in public expenditures especially in the wages of public sector workers and the privatization of state assets long before greece s syriza there was manley and his pnp although the 1970s ended with postcolonial capitulation to the new age of neoliberal globalization the decade had begun on a very different note with a radical call from the global south for a new international economic order nieo announced in the un general assembly with the declaration on the establishment of a new international economic order 1974 and the charter of economic rights and duties of states 1974 the nieo was conceived as the international corollary to the domestic projects of socialism manley and other anti colonial nationalists were pursuing how did such an ambitious effort to create an egalitarian global economy emerge despite the opposition of the united states and its allies third world states used their majority in the un to force the organization to address the unequal trade relations between the global north and south a decade prior to passage of the declaration on the establishment of the neio and the charter on economic rights and duties of states the afro asian bloc of states in the united nations had come to recognize a possible source of strength in their majority in the general assembly they mobilized to create the united nations conference of trade and development unctad unlike the world bank and imf which were created prior to the postwar surge of decolonization and empowered states of the global north unctad was organized as a forum to address trade and development in the global south despite the opposition of the united states and its allies third world states used their majority to place the argentine economist and dependency theorist raúl prebisch at the helm of this new agency it was in unctad and then on the floor of the un general assembly that the policy prescriptions of the nieo were first articulated and backed by a group of third world states that had organized themselves under the name g 77 in its ambition to transform international economic relations the nieo addressed critical issues that included the ownership of resources in land space and the seas the growing power of transnational corporations and the transportation of goods in an increasingly globalized commodity chain at its core however the nieo was concerned with the unequal relations of trade between the global north and south proponents of the nieo saw in this inequality a distorted and damaging international division of labor one that according to manley consistently relegated postcolonial states to the low end of the value added scale until something changed they would be condemned to serve as planter and reaper economically subservient to the global north with its manufacturing economies high incomes and domestic consumer markets to overcome the dependence that structured international trade unctad and the postcolonial statesmen who supported the nieo looked for lessons in the welfare states of the twentieth century these systems constructed by the labor movements of industrialized societies were by the 1970s at the peak of their success in diminishing domestic inequality the assumption that an egalitarian global economy could be modeled on the welfare state thus depended on viewing the position of postcolonial states as structurally analogous to the working class and rural sector within the states of the global north this analogy transposing from the domestic political economies of the global north to the political economy of the whole planet shaped the politics of the nieo in two ways first it framed third world solidarity as an assertive class politics as manley noted the postcolonial world now proclaimed itself the third world to mark its transition from an age of apology to one of assertiveness according to julius nyerere president of tanzania and one of manley s collaborators postcolonial states had constituted themselves as an international trade union of the poor the g 77 in the un general assembly as well as commodity associations modelled on opec that would negotiate the price of products such as bauxite and coffee were manifestations of this trade unionism like the labor movements of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries their demand for economic equality was predicated on the view that the postcolonial world had produced the wealth that the global north enjoyed in this recasting of economic relations between the global north and south the nieo s proponents reimagined the international arena as a site for a politics of redistribution that extended far beyond the discourses of aid and charity second the domestic analogy cast the postcolonial project as an effort to internationalize the postwar social compact between labor and capital the nieo was to use gunnar myrdal s term a welfare world that would democratize global economic decision making and redistribute the gains of global trade in the absence of a world state armed with the coercive power of taxation this international welfarism sought to deploy the united nations to regulate market prices of primary commodities provide compensatory financing when prices fell unexpectedly remove protectionist barriers in the global north and provide special and preferential treatment for the products postcolonial states produced unctad justified this set of policy prescriptions by insisting that the international community had a clear responsibility towards developing countries that have suffered a deterioration in their terms of trade in the same way as governments recognize a similar responsibility towards their domestic primary producers this responsibility was not framed as a rectification or reparation for past injustices of the global economy instead it was a claim that internationalizing the welfare state was necessary for overcoming the structural inequality of global trade and thereby for achieving a postimperial global economy just as the workers movements of the global north had in their struggles for unions and socialism built democracy in germany britain france and the united states so too would the states of the global south in pursuing global economic equality achieve a new world political order the welfare world of the nieo marked the high point of anti colonial politics in the united nations and indicated a sharp break with the postwar status quo if the right to self determination had universalized legal equality for postcolonial states the nieo radicalized the meaning of sovereign equality in the hands of postcolonial states sovereign equality now entailed equal decision making power within the united nations according to the charter of rights and duties the juridical equality of all states and their equal status as members of the international community granted them the right to participate fully and effectively in the international decision making process in the solution of world economic financial and monetary problems this claim of equal legislative power grounded the more ambitious claim that sovereign equality had material implications it required and entailed an equitable share of the world s wealth according to the declaration on the establishment of the nieo the welfare world aimed for the broadest co operation of all the states members of the international community based on equity whereby the prevailing disparities in the world may be banished and prosperity secured for all postcolonial states constituted themselves as an international trade union of the poor with demands predicated on the view that the postcolonial world had produced the wealth that the global north enjoyed fearing that third world states would launch commodity embargoes on the model of opec s 1973 oil embargo western statesmen initially pursued a conciliatory policy of appeasement in public even as they criticized the nieo privately in this context postcolonial states gained allies among social democrats in the global north and secured small victories for instance with the addition of part 4 to the general agreement on trade and tariffs postcolonial states were able to secure lower tariffs in the global north on some of their goods moreover postcolonial states were freed from the requirement of reciprocity in trade agreements with the global north these special and preferential provisions recognized the unfair character of international trade and sought to strengthen the position of postcolonial states however the political openings that made possible these concessions and enabled the third world to demand the nieo proved narrow with commodity prices declining and debt skyrocketing the bargaining power of postcolonial states eroded rapidly by the end of the 1970s the era of neoliberal globalization had dawned displacing visions of a welfare world leading the opposition to the nieo the world bank and imf rejected its aspiration to democratic and universal international economic law instead these financial institutions insulated the global economy from political contestation by recasting it as the domain of technocratic expertise in doing so they rejected the claim that the global economy could be subject to demands for redistribution the colony went free stood for a brief moment in the sun then moved back again toward servitude this time to the empire of debt almost forty years after the triumph of neoliberalism over the nieo it is difficult to imagine that another world was possible in accepting this triumph as inevitable we have forgotten that decolonization promised not only to free nations from foreign domination but also to remake the world from our perspective the wave of independence movements that followed world war ii is largely associated with the moral and legal delegitimization of alien rule the transition from colony to nation and the expansion of the international society to include previously excluded african asian and caribbean states in this view anti colonial nationalists appropriated the principle of self determination and the modular form of the nation state expanding and universalizing languages and institutions with a european provenance this is a compelling narrative because it describes the world that emerged from decolonization in the three decades between 1945 and 1975 un membership had grown from 51 states to 144 at the turn of the twentieth century european states ruled 84 percent of earth s surface by 1975 the remnants of alien rule largely in southern africa appeared to be anachronistic and barbaric holdouts however this narrative obscures some of the most innovative aspects of the politics of decolonization by eliding its global ambitions and it thereby misses the mechanisms by which empire reasserted itself persisting into our time and reinforcing global white supremacy the insight that democratic self governance depended on an international context conducive to its exercise emerged out of a sense that empire s globalization could be made egalitarian but could not be reversed when african and west indian nationalists met at the fifth pan african congress in manchester in 1945 to articulate a global vision of decolonization national independence was high on their agenda but it was only one part of an internationalist framework that looked forward to inevitable world unity and federation from ghana s nkrumah who helped to organize the pan african congress to jamaica s manley anti colonial nationalists pitched decolonization on this global scale to address the global character of imperialism in their view empire was a globalizing force that unequally and violently integrated disparate peoples and lands with the gun and the lash it had made a single world from many it produced according to w e b du bois a global color line through which europe dominated the darker races of men in asia and africa in america and the islands of the sea this structure of racial hierarchy endured well after the achievement of juridical independence finding a new form in manley s real battleground which demarcated the postcolonial world and the global north seeking to undo international economic hierarchies and shore up the right to self determination the nieo sought to realize the aspiration to world unity and federation by creating international frameworks that would support self rule at home this novel combination of nation building and world making the idea that democratic self governance depended on an international context conducive to its exercise emerged out of the sense that empire s globalization could be made egalitarian but could not be reversed the world was already unified under the terms of white supremacy and capitalist exploitation as manley pointed out the caribbean itself was a global formation and could not be disaggregated from the international political and economic relations in which it was embedded this extreme form of extraversion necessarily required moving beyond national insularity the ideal of a national independence disembedded from the world was not only a fantasy for decolonizing nations it was also increasingly impossible for the global north anticipating the contemporary dilemmas of neoliberal globalization manley argued that international entanglements of trade capital flows and financialization as well as the emergence of transnational private actors threatened to undermine the capacity of all states to steer and regulate their national economies for manley the multinational corporation revealed the growing contradictions between the international economy and the bounded nation state in creating an international system of political management for the world economy the nieo would supplement the diminished role of the state it would create a system for political and democratic regulation of the global economy ultimately benefiting all states and peoples thus while anticolonial nationalists reimagined international institutions for the postcolonial condition their vision extended beyond the global south the democratic decision making and global redistribution at the heart of the nieo could yet again be a source for inspiration especially in our present moment when the tension between nationalism and internationalism electrifies political debate brexit the election of donald trump and the wave of authoritarian populism surging across the west all frame national insularity as the solution to an age of neoliberal globalization by withdrawing from international institutions erecting barriers to global trade and closing borders to migrants the new right in the global north aspires to realize a vision of national independence that manley and other anti colonial nationalists already realized was impossible fifty years ago but if the right s model of national insularity is impossible the neoliberal globalization that displaced anti colonial world making and has been the order of the day since the 1980s is equally untenable its vision of an economy insulated from political contestation and its rejection of distributive justice nationally and globally have magnified inequality and contributed to the rise of the new right one vision would insulate nation states from the world the other the world from its people in this context demanding a return to the liberal world order as leading scholars in international relations and international law have recently done is an inadequate response it obscures the ways that the illiberal backlash of our moment emerged out of the inequalities and hypocrisies of that very same system from our vantage point the welfare world of the nieo might appear utopian and unrealistic but to dismiss the world that decolonization aspired to make is to refuse to reckon with the dilemmas we inherited from the end of empire it is to evade our responsibility to build a world after empire our world like manley s is characterized by a battleground of widening inequality and ongoing domination we cannot simply recreate the 1970s vision of a welfare world but we can take from its architects the insight that building an egalitarian and postimperial world is the only route to true democratic self governance
you don t have to agree with everything in the green new deal to acknowledge that it s very much an investment program not a mere giveaway so it has been dismaying to see how much commentary on these proposals dismisses the whole thing as impractical was there the same pushback against republican tax cuts no much of president donald trump s state of the union address was devoted to describing the menaces he claims face america mainly the menace of scary brown people but also the menace of socialism and there has been a lot of discussion in the news media of what he said on those topics there has however been little coverage of one of the most revealing aspects of the sotu what trump said about the menace of america s historically large government debt but wait you may object he didn t say anything about debt indeed he didn t not one word but that s what was so revealing do you have something to say share your opinion by sending a letter to the editor email share your opinion by sending a letter to the editor email letters seattletimes com and please include your full name address and telephone number for verification only letters are limited to 200 words after all republicans spent the entire obama administration inveighing constantly about the dangers of debt warning that america faced a looming crisis unless deficits were drastically reduced now that they re in power however and with the deficit surging thanks to a huge tax cut for corporations and the rich they ve totally dropped the subject according to abc news mick mulvaney trump s acting chief of staff explained to gop members of congress why debt wouldn t get a single mention in the sotu nobody cares and you know he s kind of right it s not just republicans who suddenly seemed to stop caring about debt for years deficit scolds dominated discourse inside the beltway much of the news media treated the urgency of fiscal austerity as an unquestioned fact abandoning the usual rules of reportorial neutrality and plunging into outright advocacy yet since trump s election those voices have become oddly muted what we ve just seen confirmed then is what some of us were trying to tell you from the beginning all that wailing about debt was hypocritical republicans never actually cared about debt they just pretended to be deficit hawks as a way to hamstring president barack obama s agenda and many centrists have turned out to have a double standard reserving passionate concern about debt for times when democrats hold power but while the about face on debt has as i said been deeply revealing there are still two big questions first how much should we care about debt second will a double standard continue to prevail that is will the deficit scolds suddenly get vocal again if and when democrats regain power on the first question one surprising thing about the debt obsession that peaked around 2011 is that it never had much basis in economic analysis on the contrary everything we know about fiscal policy says that it s a mistake to focus on deficit reduction when unemployment is high and interest rates are low as they were when the fiscal scolds were at their loudest the case for worrying about debt is stronger now given low unemployment but interest rates are still very low by historical standards less than 1 percent after adjusting for inflation this is so low that we needn t fear that debt will snowball with interest payments blowing up the deficit it also suggests that we re suffering from chronic weakness in private investment demand which by the way the 2017 tax cut doesn t seem to have boosted at all so in the past few months a number of prominent economists including the former chief economist of the international monetary fund and top economists from the obama administration have published analyses saying that even now with unemployment quite low debt is much less of a problem than previously thought it s still a bad idea to run up debt for no good reason say to provide tax breaks that corporations just use to buy back their own stock which is of course what the gop did but borrowing at ultralow interest rates to pay for investments in the future infrastructure of course but also things like nutrition and health care for the young who are the workers of tomorrow is very defensible which brings us to the question of double standards you don t have to agree with everything in proposals for a green new deal to acknowledge that it s very much an investment program not a mere giveaway so it has been very dismaying to see how much commentary on these proposals either demands an immediate detailed explanation of how democrats would pay for their ideas or dismisses the whole thing as impractical was there the same pushback against republican tax cuts no look we ve seen this over and over again three times since 1980 republicans rail against budget deficits when they re out of power then drop all their concerns and send the deficit soaring once they are in a position to cut taxes then when it s the democrats turn they re expected to clean up the republicans red ink rather than address their own priorities enough already i m not saying that democrats should completely ignore the fiscal implications of their actions really big spending plans especially if they don t clearly involve investment for example a major expansion of federal health spending will have to be paid for with new taxes but if and when democrats are in a position to make policy they should be ambitious and not let the deficit scolds scare them into thinking small

restaurant brands international inc rbi to shift costs to franchisees industry observers said this came as rbi reported a drop in its fourth quarter profit despite improved sales mostly because of one

with the wind down of the beijing trade talks we can anticipate a spate of potential announcements reductions in american tariffs resumption of china s purchasing of u s commodities and a cooling of the growing trade war between the world s two largest economies but is that what the west needs and have we missed a critical moment to fix destructive trade policies dating back to china s accession into the world trade organization wto these are policies that undermine not just the economy of the west but our most fundamental democratic and social institutions mosads i d argue that the question we must ask ourselves isn t whether the tariffs worked president trump s tariffs on china worked insomuch as they got the attention of the chinese the real question is what next because going back to business as usual is a mistake we must address china s state owned enterprises soes intellectual property theft forced technology transfers and ultimately china s currency policies all structural issues that were not addressed at the time of the wto s decision to open the door to china it is worth examining how we got here in order to understand the depth of the problem for the united states and other western market based democracies it starts by accepting a fundamental truth while the west thought we could induce political reform in china by giving them the opportunity to participate in the global economy we have only weakened our own political and economic system since china s accession to wto in 2001 the chinese communist party has cemented its grip on power turned previously weak soes into global behemoths that dominate the world s manufacturing system and grown its economy to twice the size that was anticipated under even the rosiest of scenarios produced by the world bank there are two critical measures by which we can assess how china s 2001 accession to wto has undermined western economies first china s entry into wto ushered 750 million manufacturing workers paid 1 30th of their western counterparts into the global labor marketplace this put enormous deflationary pressure on wages in higher cost economies such as the united states second in response to the deflationary pressure of cheaper chinese manufacturing instead of seeking chinese commitment to a floating exchange rate the federal reserve and other central banks eased their own monetary policy to prevent an outright fall in overall price levels in the west so the burden of maintaining the 2 percent inflation the basis of our monetary policy fell on the non tradable sector and services in other words when chinese manufactured goods flooded the u s and pushed down the value of the basket of consumer goods with lower prices the response was fed monetary easing that had the effect of raising prices on things that could not be made in china but are critical to our way of life housing health care and education this leads me to ask what s the point of a cheap washing machine if you can t afford a home to put it in our effort to open china has produced a generation of chinese multi billionaires who will never forgo power there just as it has produced a generation in the west who are economically disenfranchised with lower incomes crushing student debt and fading hopes of home ownership this is a generation that has less reason to defend a property owning market economy and indeed there are multiple indicators of falling rates of participation in the key activities that matter to capitalist democracies how does that play into the administration s trade plans for china tariffs don t address this widespread disillusionment by a generation of young people left economically stranded and whatever framework emerges from the stand off won t address the structural problem of a chinese communist party that holds the economic might of the globe s top manufacturing power in its hands mossecondads china s political and human rights positions are antithetical to our western values embracing china through the wto has left the west economically weaker with greater wealth disparity and a cohort of young citizens cast adrift from the solid shore of what capitalism should offer them fixing our problems with china will require a long term strategy developed by the u s but with the support and collaboration of every other major western economy that strategy must force china s hand through means other than the wto which was not set up to deal with china s mercantilist trade approach when it comes to the current trade negotiations the chinese proverb of crossing the river by feeling the stones may be apt more apt may be the quote attributed to american legend yogi berra we re lost but we re making good time stewart paterson has 25 years of experience in capital markets as an equity researcher strategist and fund manager he is also the author of a newly published book china trade and power

attributable to common stockholders and unitholders the company defines ffo as adjusted attributable to common stockholders and unitholders as ffo excluding the impact of acquisition related costs and other non comparable items including but not limited to prepayment costs benefits associated with early debt retirement gains or losses on sales of non depreciable property and marketable securities deferred tax valuation allowance increases and decreases casualty related expenses and recoveries severance costs and legal costs management believes that ffo as adjusted is useful supplemental information regarding our operating performance as it provides a consistent comparison of our operating performance across time periods and allows investors to more easily compare our operating results with other reits ffo as adjusted is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance the company believes that net income loss attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ffo as adjusted however other reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffo as adjusted or similar ffo measures and accordingly our ffo as adjusted may not always be comparable to ffo as adjusted or similar ffo measures calculated by other reits ffo as adjusted should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of financial performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity a reconciliation from net income attributable to common stockholders to ffo as adjusted is provided on attachment 2 funds from operations ffo attributable to common stockholders and unitholders the company defines ffo attributable to common stockholders and unitholders as net income loss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with gaap excluding impairment write downs of depreciable real estate or of investments in non consolidated investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee gains or losses from sales of depreciable property plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for noncontrolling interests unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures this definition conforms with the national association of real estate investment trust s definition issued in april 2002 in the computation of diluted ffo if op units downreit units unvested restricted stock unvested ltip units stock options and the shares of series e cumulative convertible preferred stock are dilutive they are included in the diluted share count management considers ffo a useful metric for investors as the company uses ffo in evaluating property acquisitions and its operating performance and believes that ffo should be considered along with but not as an alternative to net income and cash flow as a measure of the company s activities in accordance with gaap ffo does not represent cash generated from operating

2017 we grew the portfolio over 22 significantly exceeding the 10 to 15 target we set for the year and we solidified our position as the top online lender to small businesses with approximately 11 billion of loans made since our inception we strengthened our risk management function we tightened underwriting in 2017 and our net charge offs improved considerably we in sourced collections on late stage delinquent accounts to improve outcomes for us and our customers and we instilled a risk based framework that enables us to rapidly adapt to changing market conditions as we responsibly grow the business we improved efficiency we consolidated loan operations in denver reduced our lease space in new york and increased the productivity of our marketing spend these actions along with many others resulted in an improved efficiency ratio for the year particularly in us lending where we continued to invest in our growth initiatives and we strengthened our funding profile we executed about 700 million of financings in 2018 and significantly lowered our borrowing costs even as market interest rates were rising our cost of funds rate improved nearly 1 point from the prior year to 5 6 in the fourth quarter additionally we improved the terms and structures of our credit facilities and increased the number and quality of our funding providers adding new banks and life insurance companies we also made significant progress on our three strategic growth initiatives first we launched odx to focus on providing banks platform and support services for the digitization of their small business lending programs we announced pnc as our second major odx banking relationship we recently went live with a pilot program and are on track for a full roll out later this year recall we re initially powering pnc s line of credit offering and hope to expand with them over time additionally achieved program volume bounced back after a dip in the second and third quarter of 2018 finally the pipeline of new banks remain strong second we re growing our international operations which further diversified our risk profile and revenue streams australia organically grew its portfolio over 80 in 2018 and credit quality remains solid and in december we announced that we are combining our canadian operations with evolocity financial group in a transaction that significantly increases the breadth and depth of our operations in canada upon closing the new ondeck canada will be the second largest online small business lender in canada with plans for continued growth and third we re expanding our product offerings we added new features to our existing loan offerings including instant funding which saw encouraging adoption results we also announced equipment finance as our next loan offering the equipment finance market opportunity is significant with the recent elfa survey stating over 35 billion of equipment finance loans and leases a less than 250 000 were originated in 2017 and the sector is right for disruption as existing lender processes are cumbersome we re initially targeting loans of 5 000 to 100 000 with terms of two to five years secured by essential use equipment that added duration means less portfolio churn and a longer earnings period than my current term loan offerings finally having an equipment finance offering increases our relevance to our plans which should lead to us capturing a greater share of their financing wallet as with past new products and market launches we ll enter the equipment finance market slowly so it will not materially impact 2019 but it has the potential to be a meaningful part of our business over time finally we delivered record profitability as we executed our strategy for the full year we generated 28 million of net income and 45 million of adjusted net income in terms of earnings per share that is 0 35 and 0 58 respectively and in the fourth quarter we generated 109 million of gross revenue 14 million of net income and 16 million of adjusted net income all of which compare very favorably to the prior periods ken will walk you through the quarter s financial results in detail but i do want to highlight the strong growth trends in our business we had record originations of 658 million in the fourth quarter driven by both the us and the international operations volume was up 2 sequentially and 21 from a year ago and it was driven by increased units as the average term loan size fell slightly in the quarter higher units are good because it means more potential cross sell and repeat business opportunities in the future from a channel perspective production from the direct and strategic partner channels increased while funding advisor originations were down slightly sequentially and the record originations drove strong loan growth of 5 in the fourth quarter and brought full year loan growth to 23 turning to credit our 2018 portfolio performance was exceptional however we did see an uptick in delinquency and charge offs in the fourth quarter so let me spend a minute there first as we ve discussed previously we are holding and collecting on delinquent loans over time as opposed to selling at a discount we used to sell these loans for less than 0 10 but by working them out over time we expect to improve on the economics while in many cases providing better alternatives for our customers as a result the percentage of 90 plus delinquent loans in our portfolios increased about a 100 basis points year over year the expected loss on these loans has already been reflected in the p l as on average we hold approximately 85 loss reserves on loans that are over 90 days delinquent second we are constantly working to optimize our underwriting decision matrix recall that we significantly tightened our credit policy in 2017 in response to elevated losses in 2016 the results are evident in the significant reduction in credit losses for that 2017 vintage which have been running below our target range that means we have been turning away some loans we should be making in 2018 we did some selected testing to optimize our funnel and our unit economics most tests performed well and those underwriting doors will remain open but if you did not perform as well as expected and while we expect those loans to be profitable we re closing those tests testing and learning are normal parts of our processes and the short duration of our portfolio allows us to take actions quickly overall our 2018 credit performance was very strong due to both our internal actions and a favorable external environment and we expect our credit metrics to normalize over the next year now let me spend some time on our 2019 priorities as we advance our mission of helping small businesses succeed through innovative lending experiences and financial products first we re going to build upon our success by continuing to grow our us lending platform objectives for the year include growing each of our distribution channels improving our customer experience and enhancing our originations and servicing platforms second we re going to continue to invest in adjacencies that offer high growth and return potential on the international front we re going to scale our international operations to position them for profitability in 2020 we expect continued strong organic growth in australia and in canada the evolocity transaction is on track to close by mid year while not expected to be material to our s earnings this year the combination significantly increases our scale in canada and improves time to profitability for that market next we re accelerating investments in odx most large banks now realize they must digitize their lending processes to remain competitive some will build some may buy and others will partner in that transformational process and we want to be the partner of choice for those banks accordingly we re going to invest in building odx capabilities this year to support its growth we will gradually roll out equipment finance loans through our distribution channels over the course of the year again not a material driver of 2019 results but the target addressable market is huge and the opportunity to innovate here is exciting and finally we will continue to fortify the foundation that supports our competitive advantages and the success of our long term model on the funding side we will work to further diversify and deepen our funding sources while maintaining appropriate liquidity with respect to risk management we will continue to optimize our decisioning models enhance our portfolio and monitoring capabilities and improve collections practices and then the technology side we will advance our technology stack which will enable us to deliver a better customer experience and drive efficiencies across products finally a few words on the macro environment the economy continues to grow and small businesses continue to see capital however small business optimism has come off its peak and economists are calling for slightly slower growth in 2019 on the competitive side small business lending continues to attract capital industry marketing spend is high but pricing remains rational and risk adjusted margins are attractive in terms of the regulatory environment we re seeing increased interest in enacting stronger privacy legislation and there are calls for additional disclosure and the elimination of confessions of judgment all of which we support additionally regulators are too receptive to innovative solutions from fintech companies and we continue to evaluate licensing and chartering options that might unify the regulatory environment in which we operate ultimately 2018 was a banner year for ondeck and we re excited about 2019 with that i ll turn it over to ken to walk through the financials ken brause chief financial officer thank you noah and good morning everyone as noah said we delivered record fourth quarter and full year earnings with a continuation of many of the positive trends we have seen all the year including strong asset growth stable to improving yields lower funding costs credit costs at the low end of our guidance and investments for the future fourth quarter net income was 14 million or 0 18 per diluted share improved from 10 million last quarter and 5 million a year ago our adjusted net income which excludes stock based compensation and 1 million sales tax refund benefit in operating expenses this quarter rose to 16 million or 0 20 per diluted share a 3 million sequential increase as portfolio growth and improved margin more than offset slight increases in provision for credit losses in operating expense of note this quarter s adjusted net income was double that of a year ago for the full year 2018 net income was 28 million which compares to a 12 million net loss in 2017 2018 adjusted net income of 45 million increased from 4 million a year ago with improvements in nearly all key performance indicators focusing on fourth quarter results and trends as the current period is most relevant to the go forward business gross revenue was 109 million up 6 million sequentially driven by higher interest income reflecting loan growth and a slight increase in other revenue loans grew 5 sequentially to 1 2 billion driven by record originations of 658 million and our loan yields increased 10 basis points sequentially to 36 6 reflecting the mix of new originations offset by the impact of higher delinquency other revenue increased roughly 600 000 to 4 1 million primarily due to increased odx volumes and servicing revenue funding costs continued to improve interest expense was down slightly to 11 2 million despite a higher average debt balance and higher market interest rates as we continue to benefit from refinancing debt at tighter spreads our cost of funds rate was 5 6 an improvement at 50 basis points sequentially and 90 basis points from a year ago we continue to improve our funding profile in december we extended a 120 million asset backed facility and tightened the average pricing on at approximately a 100 basis points the libor plus 2 45 last week we announced a new 85 million syndicated corporate credit facility with several banks which replaces the expiring 30 million facility the facility can be used for general corporate purposes and it s priced at libor plus 300 basis points which is roughly 125 basis points net savings from the prior one and we recently upsized our 20 gates facility from 100 million to 150 million and reduced the borrowing spread on it by approximately 25 basis points we also made significant progress reducing our funding related exposures last year we established local currency facilities in canada and australia that reduced our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and in december we implemented hedging strategies that reduced our exposure to rising interest rates approximately one third of our outstanding debt is now sensitive to further increases in interest rates which is down from roughly 75 last quarter given the improvements in our loan yield and cost of funds our net interest margin increased to 30 a 70 basis point sequential increase and a 280 basis point increase from a year ago moving on to credit provision expense was 40 million up 1 million sequentially reflecting higher origination volume and portfolio quality trends and the provision rate was stable at 6 as noah discussed our net charge offs and delinquency rates did tick up but remained below historic averages and the levels assumed in our pricing models we increased our allowance for loan losses to 140 million an increase generally consistent with the quarter s loan growth rates and our reserve ratio was unchanged at 12 2 compared to a year ago we increased our reserve roughly 28 relative to 23 loan growth and the reserve rate increased 60 basis points the annual increase in the reserve rate largely reflects the reserves held for 90 plus day delinquent loans stemming from the change in our collection strategy total operating expenses of 45 million included 1 million sales tax refund and rose from the prior quarter which we noted on our last call was below run rate our adjusted efficiency ratio which is operating expense as a percent of gross revenue excluding the impact of stock based compensation and noteworthy items was 39 4 up slightly from the prior quarter we expect the ratio will rise slightly in 2019 given our planned incremental investment in odx and other initiatives turning to the balance sheet liquidity remains strong as we had approximately 250 million of available borrowing capacity within our committed debt facilities and 60 million of cash and equivalents at year end and those figures exclude the recent 100 million of new borrowing capacity i mentioned we ve made considerable progress improving the terms and costs of our funding facilities and ondeck shareholders equity increased 5 sequentially to 300 million and book value per diluted share grew to 3 77 looking forward to 2019 we expect many of the positive trends to continue as we execute on the strategic priorities that we discussed earlier however given the increased profitability last year we expect to utilize our remaining us net operating loss carryforwards this year and that means we ll become a taxpayer given we will use the remaining nol in 2019 we believe our effective tax rate this year will be approximately 20 and that rate will increase to around 25 in 2020 from a balance sheet perspective we still have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset of roughly 40 million at year end 2018 we will evaluate the potential release of that valuation allowance but we don t anticipate any release until at least the second half of 2019 any release would be recorded as a discrete tax benefit and which would increase equity and book value per share at that time so in terms of specific items for 2019 for the full year we expect gross revenue between 445 million and 465 million net income attributable to ondeck between 20 million and 30 million and adjusted net income between 30 million and 40 million that guidance assumes the following performance trends relative to 2018 low double digit loan growth a slight increase in net interest margin driven by lower funding costs a slight increase in our adjusted efficiency ratio reflecting the incremental 50 million investment we discussed a provision rate near the midpoint of our 6 to 7 target range and an effective tax rate of approximately 20 for the first quarter as we begin to accrue taxes credit costs normalize and operating expenses reflect our incremental investments we therefore expect gross revenue between 108 million and 112 million net income attributable to ondeck between 2 million and 6 million and adjusted net income between 5 million and 9 million all of our guidance excludes any impact from a potential valuation allowance release and our planned business combination with evolocity which would add to the balance sheet that s not expected to be material to earnings in 2019 with that let me turn the call over to liandra for your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of eric wasserstrom with ubs your line is open eric wasserstrom ubs analyst thanks and good morning ken one quick question on the guidance on slide 14 with respect to the loan growth rate what is the underlying expectation around asset origination ken brause chief financial officer well given the duration good morning eric given the duration of our loans we would expect origination growth to be a little bit faster than the loan growth eric wasserstrom ubs analyst okay and at what stage does some of the new product initiatives start to influence the origination and loan growth figures is that a 2019 event ken brause chief financial officer not material in 2019 so i will think about it more in the 2020 time frame eric wasserstrom ubs analyst got it and then just lastly on cost of funding is there anything incremental that you view as actionable for 2019 or at this point is it largely about securing incremental funding as the balance sheet and the operations continue to expand ken brause chief financial officer sure we do have two remaining facilities that mature in 2019 and we re actively progressing on the refinancing of those so can t comment on the specifics now but we would once again hope to be able to report improved terms and then from there it would be continuing to look to refine and expand capability as needed capacity as needed rather eric wasserstrom ubs analyst and on those two facilities ken what s the aggregate size of them ken brause chief financial officer i think it s a little over 300 million 340 million in total eric wasserstrom ubs analyst okay excellent all right thanks very much ken brause chief financial officer great thanks eric operator your next question comes from the line of steven kwok with kbw your line is open steven kwok kbw analyst hi good quarter and thanks for taking my questions just first one around the you mentioned the pipeline of banks for the odx can you just comment a little bit more around the size of the banks and what stages you are in around signing some of those banks up noah breslow chief executive officer sure happy to steven this is noah so as we mentioned odx it was a launch year for us in 2018 we did announce pnc toward the end of the year as our second major bank partner and have now launched a pilot program with them on schedule and we can t comment too much on the pipeline behind that but it remains strong in fact i think you could argue it strengthened since the last earnings call and so we re seeing a mix of i would say large kind of mega or large scale banks and actually seeing some slightly smaller banks but still sizable banks into the pipeline as well so i think we re seeing some improved diversification in the pipeline maybe versus where we were six months or 12 months ago but overall again we want to focus on the pipeline there and only announce when we re well into implementing or launching a new bank partner steven kwok kbw analyst got it and then just around that 15 million of incremental investment how should we think about like the payback period number one is like can you provide a mix of what the investment spend is on between odx and technology and then what the payback period is thanks ken brause chief financial officer sure steven so as we mentioned before without getting too specific of that 15 million we said about two thirds relates to odx both in terms of the build out of the current programs as well as building infrastructure for future programs to come and making the offering more attractive to a wider range of potential banks and then the remaining third relates to investments we re making in the core infrastructure of ondeck broadly in order to again enable us to do more product launches and more efficiently add features to the existing portfolio of offerings we don t have a specific payback period but i think you can think about something in a few year time frame and we expect to see the results coming in steven kwok kbw analyst got it thanks for taking my questions ken brause chief financial officer thanks steven operator your next question comes from the line of john hecht with jefferies your line is open michael del grosso jefferies analyst hi this is actually mike on for john quick question around the assumption in the 19 guide around the provision rate could you maybe just talk to some of the levers that are in there as it relates either kind of what your outlook for originations or the macro outlook i mean your credit is generally trended pretty stable over the last several quarters noah breslow chief executive officer yeah happy to take this this is noah so our outlook really is that 2018 was strong exceptionally so and when we started the year in 2018 we talked about an operating range for the business on provision rate between 6 and 7 and we came in very consistently at the low end of that range so i think what s implied in the guidance going forward is kind of just the normalization of credit metrics and we don t want to take anything for granted and i think we ll all agree that with the start to 2019 having some anomalous events government shutdown polar vortex et cetera we just thought it was a little bit safer to think about a midpoint of our provision rate range rather than the low end of the range at least to start the year so that s kind of what s driving that originations really unchanged strong demand and really seeing that record originations in the fourth quarter after record originations in the third quarter and really the demand function we feel like is very stable and consistent for small business owners but again just reflecting a little bit more conservatism on those credits assumptions for this year michael del grosso jefferies analyst okay and then i guess as a quick follow up you cited some anomalous activity in the first quarter is that flowing through to credit that you ve seen so far or how have things trended i guess in the first noah breslow chief executive officer yeah so we re limited from commenting too much on obviously first quarter data but there s sort of both opportunities and risk with some of the events of january let s say the opportunity is obviously a certain funding channel is available for small businesses shutdown by the government the volume could flow to non government related funding sources and so i think that s one dynamic that certainly i think happened and then secondly of course i mean there s some impact of a government shutdown but our guidance reflects our latest thinking on that and so we feel the guidance adequately reflects any shock to the system that happened in january michael del grosso jefferies analyst great thanks again operator operator instructions and your next question comes from the line of james faucette with morgan stanley your line is open james faucette morgan stanley analyst great thank you very much thanks for talking my question just a couple of questions you mentioned what we ve all seen in terms of the level of competition and what seems to be an increasing level of people looking at serving this space i m wondering if you re seeing any impact or evidence of that in your operations whether it d be things like response rates or close rates to your promotions et cetera noah breslow chief executive officer so i think one of the strengths of our model james this is noah is really that we have three scaled up distribution channels we have a small partner channel a strategic channel and obviously our direct channel and so we do feel like direct conditions in the direct side they re competitive there s some competition in online marketing competition in direct mail but they were stable in the fourth quarter and we still delivered record originations sales and marketing as a percentage of our originations ticked down so i think that s another indicator of our efficiency in that area and we re able to lean on the partner channels a little bit more for growth as we did in the fourth quarter particularly our strategic partner channel grew very nicely in the fourth quarter so i think we certainly see competition out there and don t want to discount that but we do feel like this is an environment where we can grow comfortably and write the right types of loans james faucette morgan stanley analyst got it got it and when you look at that mix of origination sources and channels how should we think about where the focus is are you feeling like you have the right mix right now or do you think that there is room to move that around and focus more on one area or another noah breslow chief executive officer we re pretty comfortable with the mix we have now you might see it move a couple of percentage points between the channels over the course of the year but really we re optimistic about all three channels this year we are seeing growth trends when you look kind of year over year at the fourth quarter results all of those channels really grew on a year over year basis and some substantially so so i think it really just gets down to a little bit the relative growth rates but we try to design these channels so the economics are profitable on our first loan and then obviously we have that repeat customer dynamic as a strong driver of our long term probability james faucette morgan stanley analyst great and then last question from me just you mentioned and highlighted a couple of things that you ve done to start to deliver internationally can you how should we think about the contribution from international and what would you like to see that become as a proportion of your total loan book and revenue and over what time frame noah breslow chief executive officer that s a great question we haven t released specific guidance on the long term targets for international but i think here is a couple of facts that i think are worth thinking about one is the growth rates are obviously much higher than the overall business that are on a lower base but we did announce the evolocity transaction which will increase over growth rates even further once that closes so the growth is there the market dynamic there is strong right you have a less competitive environment than the us you have the same pain point with small businesses and you have a much more concentrated banking system so actually small businesses have fewer options in those markets and finally the credit performance in both of those markets has been better than the us with a similar pricing dynamic so the net interest margins or the spreads if you will after losses are superior in those markets so today it s a small part of our business single digit components of the revenue and the loan book but as we mentioned in our prepared remarks we do expect these businesses to be profitable actually in both markets in 2020 and it wouldn t surprise me if over time we built this up into i don t know 15 20 of our business but that will take a number of other years to get there especially if the core business continues to grow off that bigger base james faucette morgan stanley analyst great thank you so much operator your next question comes from the line of scott buck with b riley fbr your line is open scott buck b riley fbr analyst hey guys in terms of loan demand any outsized areas of demand either by industry or geography or have things remained pretty consistent with previous quarters ken brause chief financial officer it s ken i think it s been pretty consistent and pretty broad based and across all industries and geographies as i think we mentioned in our prepared remarks so no one area that is notable scott buck b riley fbr analyst okay and then in terms of investment for building out the new equipment finance business i mean what are you looking to add in terms of the heads sales and marketing expense over the course of 2019 ken brause chief financial officer so we ve not given the specific numbers on that so that investment would be included in the one third of the 15 million that s not related to odx but i d say we are looking at it as a very slow and gradual build so within the number that we ve given you for our guidance for 19 scott buck b riley fbr analyst okay perfect thank you operator and your last question come from the line of melissa wedel with jpmorgan your line is open melissa wedel jp morgan analyst thank you good morning guys i m wondering if you can elaborate a bit more on the performance of the in house collections effort is that performing as you guys had expected noah breslow chief executive officer yeah no it is we ve been testing our way into the strategy for a couple of years now but really fully converted over it to it in 2018 and so again the original math here was at the point of 90 days past due and charge off we would sell loans to a third party agency we would receive kind of high single digit cents on the dollar for that collateral and by working the loans in house and coming up with better sort of payment plans for our customers we believe that we can recover that amount within a year and then over the course of two to three years recover 2 times to 3 times that amount inaudible so it s a bit of trading dollars tomorrow versus dollars today but even when you discount that for the time value of money we think it s the right financial decision to make so overall we re happy with that and we ll continue to drive that maybe it won t be exclusively our strategy but it ll be a major part of it for sure melissa wedel jp morgan analyst okay and then point taken about international operations being relatively small component of the income statement right now but would you employ a similar strategy on the collection side internationally noah breslow chief executive officer tough to say i mean those markets are at little bit earlier stage so collections is not it is handled in house today actually but again it s not a huge driver of the results but i think the main point on international is it s got a growth rate that outstrips the rate of the us lending business we ve just announced a transaction that s going to substantially increase our international footprint and volumes and we expect it to be profitable in 2020 and instead of being a drag on our earnings as it has been over the last few years it ll start to actually being a bit of an afterburner or sort of an increased element of our earnings going forward melissa wedel jp morgan analyst okay got it thanks operator we have no further questions at this time and this will conclude today s conference call you may now disconnect duration 35 minutes call participants steve klimas head of investor relations

standards we changed some of our reporting metrics this quarter the changes and impacts are summarized on slide 17 of the earnings presentation all prior period data has been conformed to the current period presentation in all earnings related materials published today with that i ll turn the call over to noah noah breslow chief executive officer thank you steve and thank you all for joining us today we had a very successful year and have a lot to talk about this morning i ll cover highlights from the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 and then i will discuss our strategic priorities for 2019 then ken will provide more detail on the numbers give an update on funding and review our 2019 guidance finally we will take your questions 2018 was a pivotal year for ondeck and we finished strong we began the year with an ambitious agenda and we accomplished the objectives we laid out we grew the core lending franchise we had record originations of nearly 2 5 billion a 17 increase from 2017 we grew the portfolio over 22 significantly exceeding the 10 to 15 target we set for the year and we solidified our position as the top online lender to small businesses with approximately 11 billion of loans made since our inception we strengthened our risk management function we tightened underwriting in 2017 and our net charge offs improved considerably we in sourced collections on late stage delinquent accounts to improve outcomes for us and our customers and we instilled a risk based framework that enables us to rapidly adapt to changing market conditions as we responsibly grow the business we improved efficiency we consolidated loan operations in denver reduced our lease space in new york and increased the productivity of our marketing spend these actions along with many others resulted in an improved efficiency ratio for the year particularly in us lending where we continued to invest in our growth initiatives and we strengthened our funding profile we executed about 700 million of financings in 2018 and significantly lowered our borrowing costs even as market interest rates were rising our cost of funds rate improved nearly 1 point from the prior year to 5 6 in the fourth quarter additionally we improved the terms and structures of our credit facilities and increased the number and quality of our funding providers adding new banks and life insurance companies we also made significant progress on our three strategic growth initiatives first we launched odx to focus on providing banks platform and support services for the digitization of their small business lending programs we announced pnc as our second major odx banking relationship we recently went live with a pilot program and are on track for a full roll out later this year recall we re initially powering pnc s line of credit offering and hope to expand with them over time additionally achieved program volume bounced back after a dip in the second and third quarter of 2018 finally the pipeline of new banks remain strong second we re growing our international operations which further diversified our risk profile and revenue streams australia organically grew its portfolio over 80 in 2018 and credit quality remains solid and in december we announced that we are combining our canadian operations with evolocity financial group in a transaction that significantly increases the breadth and depth of our operations in canada upon closing the new ondeck canada will be the second largest online small business lender in canada with plans for continued growth and third we re expanding our product offerings we added new features to our existing loan offerings including instant funding which saw encouraging adoption results we also announced equipment finance as our next loan offering the equipment finance market opportunity is significant with the recent elfa survey stating over 35 billion of equipment finance loans and leases a less than 250 000 were originated in 2017 and the sector is right for disruption as existing lender processes are cumbersome we re initially targeting loans of 5 000 to 100 000 with terms of two to five years secured by essential use equipment that added duration means less portfolio churn and a longer earnings period than my current term loan offerings finally having an equipment finance offering increases our relevance to our plans which should lead to us capturing a greater share of their financing wallet as with past new products and market launches we ll enter the equipment finance market slowly so it will not materially impact 2019 but it has the potential to be a meaningful part of our business over time finally we delivered record profitability as we executed our strategy for the full year we generated 28 million of net income and 45 million of adjusted net income in terms of earnings per share that is 0 35 and 0 58 respectively and in the fourth quarter we generated 109 million of gross revenue 14 million of net income and 16 million of adjusted net income all of which compare very favorably to the prior periods ken will walk you through the quarter s financial results in detail but i do want to highlight the strong growth trends in our business we had record originations of 658 million in the fourth quarter driven by both the us and the international operations volume was up 2 sequentially and 21 from a year ago and it was driven by increased units as the average term loan size fell slightly in the quarter higher units are good because it means more potential cross sell and repeat business opportunities in the future from a channel perspective production from the direct and strategic partner channels increased while funding advisor originations were down slightly sequentially and the record originations drove strong loan growth of 5 in the fourth quarter and brought full year loan growth to 23 turning to credit our 2018 portfolio performance was exceptional however we did see an uptick in delinquency and charge offs in the fourth quarter so let me spend a minute there first as we ve discussed previously we are holding and collecting on delinquent loans over time as opposed to selling at a discount we used to sell these loans for less than 0 10 but by working them out over time we expect to improve on the economics while in many cases providing better alternatives for our customers as a result the percentage of 90 plus delinquent loans in our portfolios increased about a 100 basis points year over year the expected loss on these loans has already been reflected in the p l as on average we hold approximately 85 loss reserves on loans that are over 90 days delinquent second we are constantly working to optimize our underwriting decision matrix recall that we significantly tightened our credit policy in 2017 in response to elevated losses in 2016 the results are evident in the significant reduction in credit losses for that 2017 vintage which have been running below our target range that means we have been turning away some loans we should be making in 2018 we did some selected testing to optimize our funnel and our unit economics most tests performed well and those underwriting doors will remain open but if you did not perform as well as expected and while we expect those loans to be profitable we re closing those tests testing and learning are normal parts of our processes and the short duration of our portfolio allows us to take actions quickly overall our 2018 credit performance was very strong due to both our internal actions and a favorable external environment and we expect our credit metrics to normalize over the next year now let me spend some time on our 2019 priorities as we advance our mission of helping small businesses succeed through innovative lending experiences and financial products first we re going to build upon our success by continuing to grow our us lending platform objectives for the year include growing each of our distribution channels improving our customer experience and enhancing our originations and servicing platforms second we re going to continue to invest in adjacencies that offer high growth and return potential on the international front we re going to scale our international operations to position them for profitability in 2020 we expect continued strong organic growth in australia and in canada the evolocity transaction is on track to close by mid year while not expected to be material to our s earnings this year the combination significantly increases our scale in canada and improves time to profitability for that market next we re accelerating investments in odx most large banks now realize they must digitize their lending processes to remain competitive some will build some may buy and others will partner in that transformational process and we want to be the partner of choice for those banks accordingly we re going to invest in building odx capabilities this year to support its growth we will gradually roll out equipment finance loans through our distribution channels over the course of the year again not a material driver of 2019 results but the target addressable market is huge and the opportunity to innovate here is exciting and finally we will continue to fortify the foundation that supports our competitive advantages and the success of our long term model on the funding side we will work to further diversify and deepen our funding sources while maintaining appropriate liquidity with respect to risk management we will continue to optimize our decisioning models enhance our portfolio and monitoring capabilities and improve collections practices and then the technology side we will advance our technology stack which will enable us to deliver a better customer experience and drive efficiencies across products finally a few words on the macro environment the economy continues to grow and small businesses continue to see capital however small business optimism has come off its peak and economists are calling for slightly slower growth in 2019 on the competitive side small business lending continues to attract capital industry marketing spend is high but pricing remains rational and risk adjusted margins are attractive in terms of the regulatory environment we re seeing increased interest in enacting stronger privacy legislation and there are calls for additional disclosure and the elimination of confessions of judgment all of which we support additionally regulators are too receptive to innovative solutions from fintech companies and we continue to evaluate licensing and chartering options that might unify the regulatory environment in which we operate ultimately 2018 was a banner year for ondeck and we re excited about 2019 with that i ll turn it over to ken to walk through the financials ken brause chief financial officer thank you noah and good morning everyone as noah said we delivered record fourth quarter and full year earnings with a continuation of many of the positive trends we have seen all the year including strong asset growth stable to improving yields lower funding costs credit costs at the low end of our guidance and investments for the future fourth quarter net income was 14 million or 0 18 per diluted share improved from 10 million last quarter and 5 million a year ago our adjusted net income which excludes stock based compensation and 1 million sales tax refund benefit in operating expenses this quarter rose to 16 million or 0 20 per diluted share a 3 million sequential increase as portfolio growth and improved margin more than offset slight increases in provision for credit losses in operating expense of note this quarter s adjusted net income was double that of a year ago for the full year 2018 net income was 28 million which compares to a 12 million net loss in 2017 2018 adjusted net income of 45 million increased from 4 million a year ago with improvements in nearly all key performance indicators focusing on fourth quarter results and trends as the current period is most relevant to the go forward business gross revenue was 109 million up 6 million sequentially driven by higher interest income reflecting loan growth and a slight increase in other revenue loans grew 5 sequentially to 1 2 billion driven by record originations of 658 million and our loan yields increased 10 basis points sequentially to 36 6 reflecting the mix of new originations offset by the impact of higher delinquency other revenue increased roughly 600 000 to 4 1 million primarily due to increased odx volumes and servicing revenue funding costs continued to improve interest expense was down slightly to 11 2 million despite a higher average debt balance and higher market interest rates as we continue to benefit from refinancing debt at tighter spreads our cost of funds rate was 5 6 an improvement at 50 basis points sequentially and 90 basis points from a year ago we continue to improve our funding profile in december we extended a 120 million asset backed facility and tightened the average pricing on at approximately a 100 basis points the libor plus 2 45 last week we announced a new 85 million syndicated corporate credit facility with several banks which replaces the expiring 30 million facility the facility can be used for general corporate purposes and it s priced at libor plus 300 basis points which is roughly 125 basis points net savings from the prior one and we recently upsized our 20 gates facility from 100 million to 150 million and reduced the borrowing spread on it by approximately 25 basis points we also made significant progress reducing our funding related exposures last year we established local currency facilities in canada and australia that reduced our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and in december we implemented hedging strategies that reduced our exposure to rising interest rates approximately one third of our outstanding debt is now sensitive to further increases in interest rates which is down from roughly 75 last quarter given the improvements in our loan yield and cost of funds our net interest margin increased to 30 a 70 basis point sequential increase and a 280 basis point increase from a year ago moving on to credit provision expense was 40 million up 1 million sequentially reflecting higher origination volume and portfolio quality trends and the provision rate was stable at 6 as noah discussed our net charge offs and delinquency rates did tick up but remained below historic averages and the levels assumed in our pricing models we increased our allowance for loan losses to 140 million an increase generally consistent with the quarter s loan growth rates and our reserve ratio was unchanged at 12 2 compared to a year ago we increased our reserve roughly 28 relative to 23 loan growth and the reserve rate increased 60 basis points the annual increase in the reserve rate largely reflects the reserves held for 90 plus day delinquent loans stemming from the change in our collection strategy total operating expenses of 45 million included 1 million sales tax refund and rose from the prior quarter which we noted on our last call was below run rate our adjusted efficiency ratio which is operating expense as a percent of gross revenue excluding the impact of stock based compensation and noteworthy items was 39 4 up slightly from the prior quarter we expect the ratio will rise slightly in 2019 given our planned incremental investment in odx and other initiatives turning to the balance sheet liquidity remains strong as we had approximately 250 million of available borrowing capacity within our committed debt facilities and 60 million of cash and equivalents at year end and those figures exclude the recent 100 million of new borrowing capacity i mentioned we ve made considerable progress improving the terms and costs of our funding facilities and ondeck shareholders equity increased 5 sequentially to 300 million and book value per diluted share grew to 3 77 looking forward to 2019 we expect many of the positive trends to continue as we execute on the strategic priorities that we discussed earlier however given the increased profitability last year we expect to utilize our remaining us net operating loss carryforwards this year and that means we ll become a taxpayer given we will use the remaining nol in 2019 we believe our effective tax rate this year will be approximately 20 and that rate will increase to around 25 in 2020 from a balance sheet perspective we still have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset of roughly 40 million at year end 2018 we will evaluate the potential release of that valuation allowance but we don t anticipate any release until at least the second half of 2019 any release would be recorded as a discrete tax benefit and which would increase equity and book value per share at that time so in terms of specific items for 2019 for the full year we expect gross revenue between 445 million and 465 million net income attributable to ondeck between 20 million and 30 million and adjusted net income between 30 million and 40 million that guidance assumes the following performance trends relative to 2018 low double digit loan growth a slight increase in net interest margin driven by lower funding costs a slight increase in our adjusted efficiency ratio reflecting the incremental 50 million investment we discussed a provision rate near the midpoint of our 6 to 7 target range and an effective tax rate of approximately 20 for the first quarter as we begin to accrue taxes credit costs normalize and operating expenses reflect our incremental investments we therefore expect gross revenue between 108 million and 112 million net income attributable to ondeck between 2 million and 6 million and adjusted net income between 5 million and 9 million all of our guidance excludes any impact from a potential valuation allowance release and our planned business combination with evolocity which would add to the balance sheet that s not expected to be material to earnings in 2019 with that let me turn the call over to liandra for your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of eric wasserstrom with ubs your line is open eric wasserstrom ubs analyst thanks and good morning ken one quick question on the guidance on slide 14 with respect to the loan growth rate what is the underlying expectation around asset origination ken brause chief financial officer well given the duration good morning eric given the duration of our loans we would expect origination growth to be a little bit faster than the loan growth eric wasserstrom ubs analyst okay and at what stage does some of the new product initiatives start to influence the origination and loan growth figures is that a 2019 event ken brause chief financial officer not material in 2019 so i will think about it more in the 2020 time frame eric wasserstrom ubs analyst got it and then just lastly on cost of funding is there anything incremental that you view as actionable for 2019 or at this point is it largely about securing incremental funding as the balance sheet and the operations continue to expand ken brause chief financial officer sure we do have two remaining facilities that mature in 2019 and we re actively progressing on the refinancing of those so can t comment on the specifics now but we would once again hope to be able to report improved terms and then from there it would be continuing to look to refine and expand capability as needed capacity as needed rather eric wasserstrom ubs analyst and on those two facilities ken what s the aggregate size of them ken brause chief financial officer i think it s a little over 300 million 340 million in total eric wasserstrom ubs analyst okay excellent all right thanks very much ken brause chief financial officer great thanks eric operator your next question comes from the line of steven kwok with kbw your line is open steven kwok kbw analyst hi good quarter and thanks for taking my questions just first one around the you mentioned the pipeline of banks for the odx can you just comment a little bit more around the size of the banks and what stages you are in around signing some of those banks up noah breslow chief executive officer sure happy to steven this is noah so as we mentioned odx it was a launch year for us in 2018 we did announce pnc toward the end of the year as our second major bank partner and have now launched a pilot program with them on schedule and we can t comment too much on the pipeline behind that but it remains strong in fact i think you could argue it strengthened since the last earnings call and so we re seeing a mix of i would say large kind of mega or large scale banks and actually seeing some slightly smaller banks but still sizable banks into the pipeline as well so i think we re seeing some improved diversification in the pipeline maybe versus where we were six months or 12 months ago but overall again we want to focus on the pipeline there and only announce when we re well into implementing or launching a new bank partner steven kwok kbw analyst got it and then just around that 15 million of incremental investment how should we think about like the payback period number one is like can you provide a mix of what the investment spend is on between odx and technology and then what the payback period is thanks ken brause chief financial officer sure steven so as we mentioned before without getting too specific of that 15 million we said about two thirds relates to odx both in terms of the build out of the current programs as well as building infrastructure for future programs to come and making the offering more attractive to a wider range of potential banks and then the remaining third relates to investments we re making in the core infrastructure of ondeck broadly in order to again enable us to do more product launches and more efficiently add features to the existing portfolio of offerings we don t have a specific payback period but i think you can think about something in a few year time frame and we expect to see the results coming in steven kwok kbw analyst got it thanks for taking my questions ken brause chief financial officer thanks steven operator your next question comes from the line of john hecht with jefferies your line is open michael del grosso jefferies analyst hi this is actually mike on for john quick question around the assumption in the 19 guide around the provision rate could you maybe just talk to some of the levers that are in there as it relates either kind of what your outlook for originations or the macro outlook i mean your credit is generally trended pretty stable over the last several quarters noah breslow chief executive officer yeah happy to take this this is noah so our outlook really is that 2018 was strong exceptionally so and when we started the year in 2018 we talked about an operating range for the business on provision rate between 6 and 7 and we came in very consistently at the low end of that range so i think what s implied in the guidance going forward is kind of just the normalization of credit metrics and we don t want to take anything for granted and i think we ll all agree that with the start to 2019 having some anomalous events government shutdown polar vortex et cetera we just thought it was a little bit safer to think about a midpoint of our provision rate range rather than the low end of the range at least to start the year so that s kind of what s driving that originations really unchanged strong demand and really seeing that record originations in the fourth quarter after record originations in the third quarter and really the demand function we feel like is very stable and consistent for small business owners but again just reflecting a little bit more conservatism on those credits assumptions for this year michael del grosso jefferies analyst okay and then i guess as a quick follow up you cited some anomalous activity in the first quarter is that flowing through to credit that you ve seen so far or how have things trended i guess in the first noah breslow chief executive officer yeah so we re limited from commenting too much on obviously first quarter data but there s sort of both opportunities and risk with some of the events of january let s say the opportunity is obviously a certain funding channel is available for small businesses shutdown by the government the volume could flow to non government related funding sources and so i think that s one dynamic that certainly i think happened and then secondly of course i mean there s some impact of a government shutdown but our guidance reflects our latest thinking on that and so we feel the guidance adequately reflects any shock to the system that happened in january michael del grosso jefferies analyst great thanks again operator operator instructions and your next question comes from the line of james faucette with morgan stanley your line is open james faucette morgan stanley analyst great thank you very much thanks for talking my question just a couple of questions you mentioned what we ve all seen in terms of the level of competition and what seems to be an increasing level of people looking at serving this space i m wondering if you re seeing any impact or evidence of that in your operations whether it d be things like response rates or close rates to your promotions et cetera noah breslow chief executive officer so i think one of the strengths of our model james this is noah is really that we have three scaled up distribution channels we have a small partner channel a strategic channel and obviously our direct channel and so we do feel like direct conditions in the direct side they re competitive there s some competition in online marketing competition in direct mail but they were stable in the fourth quarter and we still delivered record originations sales and marketing as a percentage of our originations ticked down so i think that s another indicator of our efficiency in that area and we re able to lean on the partner channels a little bit more for growth as we did in the fourth quarter particularly our strategic partner channel grew very nicely in the fourth quarter so i think we certainly see competition out there and don t want to discount that but we do feel like this is an environment where we can grow comfortably and write the right types of loans james faucette morgan stanley analyst got it got it and when you look at that mix of origination sources and channels how should we think about where the focus is are you feeling like you have the right mix right now or do you think that there is room to move that around and focus more on one area or another noah breslow chief executive officer we re pretty comfortable with the mix we have now you might see it move a couple of percentage points between the channels over the course of the year but really we re optimistic about all three channels this year we are seeing growth trends when you look kind of year over year at the fourth quarter results all of those channels really grew on a year over year basis and some substantially so so i think it really just gets down to a little bit the relative growth rates but we try to design these channels so the economics are profitable on our first loan and then obviously we have that repeat customer dynamic as a strong driver of our long term probability james faucette morgan stanley analyst great and then last question from me just you mentioned and highlighted a couple of things that you ve done to start to deliver internationally can you how should we think about the contribution from international and what would you like to see that become as a proportion of your total loan book and revenue and over what time frame noah breslow chief executive officer that s a great question we haven t released specific guidance on the long term targets for international but i think here is a couple of facts that i think are worth thinking about one is the growth rates are obviously much higher than the overall business that are on a lower base but we did announce the evolocity transaction which will increase over growth rates even further once that closes so the growth is there the market dynamic there is strong right you have a less competitive environment than the us you have the same pain point with small businesses and you have a much more concentrated banking system so actually small businesses have fewer options in those markets and finally the credit performance in both of those markets has been better than the us with a similar pricing dynamic so the net interest margins or the spreads if you will after losses are superior in those markets so today it s a small part of our business single digit components of the revenue and the loan book but as we mentioned in our prepared remarks we do expect these businesses to be profitable actually in both markets in 2020 and it wouldn t surprise me if over time we built this up into i don t know 15 20 of our business but that will take a number of other years to get there especially if the core business continues to grow off that bigger base james faucette morgan stanley analyst great thank you so much operator your next question comes from the line of scott buck with b riley fbr your line is open scott buck b riley fbr analyst hey guys in terms of loan demand any outsized areas of demand either by industry or geography or have things remained pretty consistent with previous quarters ken brause chief financial officer it s ken i think it s been pretty consistent and pretty broad based and across all industries and geographies as i think we mentioned in our prepared remarks so no one area that is notable scott buck b riley fbr analyst okay and then in terms of investment for building out the new equipment finance business i mean what are you looking to add in terms of the heads sales and marketing expense over the course of 2019 ken brause chief financial officer so we ve not given the specific numbers on that so that investment would be included in the one third of the 15 million that s not related to odx but i d say we are looking at it as a very slow and gradual build so within the number that we ve given you for our guidance for 19 scott buck b riley fbr analyst okay perfect thank you operator and your last question come from the line of melissa wedel with jpmorgan your line is open melissa wedel jp morgan analyst thank you good morning guys i m wondering if you can elaborate a bit more on the performance of the in house collections effort is that performing as you guys had expected noah breslow chief executive officer yeah no it is we ve been testing our way into the strategy for a couple of years now but really fully converted over it to it in 2018 and so again the original math here was at the point of 90 days past due and charge off we would sell loans to a third party agency we would receive kind of high single digit cents on the dollar for that collateral and by working the loans in house and coming up with better sort of payment plans for our customers we believe that we can recover that amount within a year and then over the course of two to three years recover 2 times to 3 times that amount inaudible so it s a bit of trading dollars tomorrow versus dollars today but even when you discount that for the time value of money we think it s the right financial decision to make so overall we re happy with that and we ll continue to drive that maybe it won t be exclusively our strategy but it ll be a major part of it for sure melissa wedel jp morgan analyst okay and then point taken about international operations being relatively small component of the income statement right now but would you employ a similar strategy on the collection side internationally noah breslow chief executive officer tough to say i mean those markets are at little bit earlier stage so collections is not it is handled in house today actually but again it s not a huge driver of the results but i think the main point on international is it s got a growth rate that outstrips the rate of the us lending business we ve just announced a transaction that s going to substantially increase our international footprint and volumes and we expect it to be profitable in 2020 and instead of being a drag on our earnings as it has been over the last few years it ll start to actually being a bit of an afterburner or sort of an increased element of our earnings going forward melissa wedel jp morgan analyst okay got it thanks operator we have no further questions at this time and this will conclude today s conference call you may now disconnect duration 35 minutes call participants steve klimas head of investor relations

by when the international monetary fund imf issued its world economic outlook update in january 2018 the future looked bright indeed even the title of the update was very optimistic brighter prospects optimistic markets challenges ahead and under the cheer leadership of the imf an overwhelming consensus was formed the cyclical upswing underway since mid 2016 had continued to strengthen producing in 2017 the broadest synchronised global growth upsurge since 2010 and the growth would last as far as the eye could see here what is meant by global growth is the growth of the world gross domestic product gdp or the world income it turned out that 2018 was a major disappointment and the imf s world economic outlook update in january 2019 a weakening global expansion was a bit cautious christine lagarde the imf s managing director said even as the global economy moves forward the risks that lie ahead are getting greater does that mean a global recession is around the corner no but the risk of a sharper decline in global growth has certainly increased so we are debating whether 2019 will be the year of synchronised global slowdown or the year of synchronised global recession with the imf dismissing the possibility of a global recession what is a global recession the imf estimated the global growth for 2018 at 3 7 and expects the global growth for 2019 to be at 3 5 but its sister institution the world bank was way gloomier the world bank estimated the global growth for 2018 at 3 and expects the global growth for 2019 to be at 2 9 so we are not so sure if the global growth for 2018 was at 3 7 or 3 and whether to expect a 3 5 or 2 9 growth in 2019 it depends on whether you choose to believe the imf or the world bank but how do we define what a global recession is the answer depends on to whom the question is directed prior to the global financial crisis gfc that started in the summer of 2007 the imf used to define a global recession as global growth of less than 2 or 3 depending on who the director of research at the time was but more often than not when global growth fell to 3 or below the imf called it a global recession the gfc changed all that olivier blanchard the director of research of the imf between september 2008 and october 2015 objected to calling a global growth of less than 3 a global recession in 2008 when global growth was already below 3 now the imf has a very complicated way of defining what a global recession is but if we stick with the older imf definition and choose to believe the world bank the world was already in global recession in 2018 which is expected to continue in 2019 if we do not do this then there was no global recession in 2018 and as lagarde said a global recession is not around the corner however a new survey of chief executives from the conference board a global independent business membership and research association indicates that the possibility of a global recession ranks as the top concern on the minds of corporate leaders as they head into 2019 weber 2019 so we better wait and see what 2019 will bring at this front although reiermann 2019 informs us that germany has already begun getting ready for the worst the financial stability front the imf issued its last global financial stability report in october 2018 the report was titled a decade after the global financial crisis are we safer and the assessment was that we were not safe in the foreword of the report tobias adrian wrote looking ahead clouds appear on the horizon the global economic recovery has been uneven and inequality has risen fuelling inward looking policies and contributing to increased policy uncertainty adrian also wrote the ratio of total nonfinancial sector debt to gdp in jurisdictions with systemically important financial sectors stands at an all time high of 250 percent asset valuations remain stretched across several sectors and regions and underwriting standards are deteriorating including in many segments of market based finance some major concerns in the report were inman 2018 i failure of governments and regulators to push through all the reforms needed to protect the system from reckless behaviour ii global debt levels well above those at the time of the last crash in 2008 iii dramatic rise in lending by the so cal led shadow banks in china and the failure to impose tough restrictions on insurance companies and asset managers and iv the growth of global banks such as jp morgan and the industrial and commercial bank of china to a scale beyond that seen in 2008 leading to fears that they remain too big to fail and on 15 january 2019 the institute of international finance the global association of the finance industry released its last global debt monitor results under the title devil in the details four of the important results they shared are i global debt has grown by over 12 since 2016 reaching 244 trillion or 318 of the world gdp in q3 2018 although this is slightly lower than the all time high of 320 of the world gdp in q3 2016 ii the corporate sector accounted for over a third of the rise putting debt gdp at a record high of 92 of the world gdp iii risk of dollar funding shortages dollar denominated liabilities of non united states us banks stand at 13 3 trillion 21 of the world gdp iv rollover risk is high 3 9 trillion of emerging market bonds syndicated loans come due through end 2020 global stocks one important financial event that is not mentioned in the above reports is the global stock market slump of 2018 the world stock market capitalisation as measured by the bloomberg wcauwrld index reached its all time peak of 87 79 million on 28 january 2018 and after several downwardly steps during the year bottomed at 66 02 million on 26 december 2018 about a 25 drop in 11 months this huge drop forced the major central banks to make a u turn from their monetary tightening stance that they have been advertising for quite some time and after massive liquidity injections in major jurisdictions the global stocks enjoyed their best january in 2019 since 1987 with a more than 20 gain in a single month and this happened for no economic reason other than a massive liquidity injection by major jurisdictions and the u turn by the major central banks including the federal reserve system fed the us central bank the fed s announcement came on 31 january 2019 it signalled that it would be patient about further rate increases and flexible about unwinding its balance sheet and only seven days earlier on 24 january 2019 the european central bank had announced that it would keep key interest rates at their present levels through the summer of 2019 and longer if necessary and although its bond buying programme had ended it planned to reinvest cash from maturing bonds for an extended period of time last but not least on 25 january 2019 the people s bank of china pbc launched a central bank bills swap presumably to support liquidity of banks perpetual bonds and to encourage banks to replenish capital through perpetual bond issuance which frances coppola called the great chinese bank bailout coppola 2019 unprepared for recession the person who put these together was no other than the first deputy managing director of the imf david lipton at a meeting of the american economic association in atlanta lipton told the financial times on 6 january 2019 that the leaders of the world s largest countries are dangerously unprepared for the consequences of a serious global slow down smith and greeley 2019 lipton said the next recession is somewhere over the horizon and we are less prepared to deal with that than we should be less prepared than in the last crisis given all of this if a global recession hits sooner than the imf expects who knows what may happen to the banking systems in the eurozone and china in the case of china also to the shadow banking system or to the global stocks in general and the us stocks in particular or to all of these as financial crises tend to be contagious alternatively if a financial crisis originates from any of these and spreads who knows what may happen to the global economy let me now conclude with the lyrics of one of my favourite songs la sagrada familia from the gaudi album by alan parson s project who knows where the road may lead us only a fool would say who knows wha s been lost along the way look for the promised land in all of the dreams we share how will we know when we are there how will we know only a fool would say references coppola

rate equals annualized payments from customers extrapolated based on the operating and committed capacity as of the reporting dates in estimating the portfolio revenue run rate the company multiplies the ppa contract price per kilowatt hour by the estimated annual energy output for all operating and committed solar projects as of the reporting date the estimated annual energy output of the company s solar projects is calculated using power generation simulation software and validated by independent engineering firms the main assumption used in the calculation is the project location which enables the software to derive the estimated annual energy output from certain meteorological data including the temperature and solar insolation based on the project location the following table sets

assumes no obligation to update these forward looking statements use of non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure we present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance this measurement is not recognized in accordance with u s gaap and should not be viewed as an alternative to u s gaap measures of performance the presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items we define adjusted ebitda as net loss income plus a income tax expense b interest expense net c depreciation and amortization and d loss income on foreign currency exchange we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in assessing our ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of our operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends however this measure should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income or other measures of performance determined in accordance with u s gaap moreover adjusted ebitda as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation our management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions adjusted ebitda is also used by securities analysts lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry for example interest expense can be highly dependent on a company s capital structure debt levels and credit ratings therefore the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies in addition the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate as a result effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under u s gaap some of these limitations include it does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments or foreign exchange gain loss it does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for working capital it does not reflect significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our outstanding debt it does not reflect payments made or future requirements for income taxes and although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or paid in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements or payments investors are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons the company considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis for more information

dates in estimating the portfolio revenue run rate the company multiplies the ppa contract price per kilowatt hour by the estimated annual energy output for all operating and committed solar projects as of the reporting date the estimated annual energy output of the company s solar projects is calculated using power generation simulation software and validated by independent engineering firms the main assumption used in the calculation is the project location which enables the software to derive the estimated annual energy output from certain meteorological data including the temperature and solar insolation based on the project location the following table sets forth with respect to the company s ppas the aggregate portfolio revenue run rate and estimated annual energy output as of the

information available to us as of the date hereof and the company assumes no obligation to update these forward looking statements use of non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure we present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance this measurement is not recognized in accordance with u s gaap and should not be viewed as an alternative to u s gaap measures of performance the presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items we define adjusted ebitda as net loss income plus a income tax expense b interest expense net c depreciation and amortization and d loss income on foreign currency exchange we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in assessing our ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of our operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends however this measure should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income or other measures of performance determined in accordance with u s gaap moreover adjusted ebitda as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation our management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions adjusted ebitda is also used by securities analysts lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry for example interest expense can be highly dependent on a company s capital structure debt levels and credit ratings therefore the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies in addition the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate as a result effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under u s gaap some of these limitations include it does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments or foreign exchange gain loss it does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for working capital it does not reflect significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our outstanding debt it does not reflect payments made or future requirements for income taxes and although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or paid in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements or payments investors are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons the company considers it appropriate for

this article is more than 5 years old this story appears in the february 27 2019 issue of forbes subscribe too bad had europeans understood the proper principles of monetary policy the euro would be a resounding success doing for participating eu countries just what the dollar has done for the u s a common currency that enormously facilitates prosperity creating investment and commerce but this extraordinary creation has been bedeviled by profound misunderstandings that could ultimately threaten its very existence many critics moan that the euro has prevented greece portugal spain ireland and others from using devaluations to help their economies recover from terrible contractions still others carp that the euro enabled germany to rack up big trade surpluses without fear of having to revalue its currency as previously would have happened the biggest condemnation has been that the euro is doomed unless the eu has a united financial and banking regulatory system as well as a united fiscal budgetary system these and other negative assessments are off base prosperity the euro did make it easier for capital to flow across borders thereby reducing costs of exchanging individual currencies and hedging against the risks of the currencies fluctuating against each other however the continent s chronic subpar economic performance didn t improve as much as had been expected because the problems are structural excessive taxation and regulation particularly with regard to inflexible labor practices when germany made some labor and pension rule reforms in the early 2000s the country s economy markedly improved the euro is a straitjacket one of the most pernicious myths afflicting current economic policymaking is that devaluations are a great way to boost a troubled economy exports suddenly become cheaper goes this happy talk thereby ginning up overseas sales an artificially enlarged money supply will stimulate activity but the reality is this no state in history ever devalued its way to strength and prosperity an unstable currency hurts productive investment and worse misdirects capital have we forgotten the housing bubble whose root cause was a cheapening dollar maryland public television our town films nonetheless a host of economists lament that countries such as greece and italy can t devalue their currencies since they re tied to the euro everyone should rejoice that this is the case otherwise greece would have become the eu s version of venezuela and italy s lira would resemble argentina s chronically shrinking peso the state of illinois is in severe financial straits but no one talks about it leaving the u s dollar zone to cope with its woes the euro can t work without a single europe wide regulatory and tax budget arrangement nonsense a country can use any currency it wants panama ecuador el salvador and timor leste east timor directly use the u s dollar countries such as costa rica allow the dollar to be used alongside their own national currencies the euro is legal tender in monaco and vatican city numerous nations employ currency boards to rigidly link their money to a hard currency such as the dollar or the euro under a currency board the local currency is backed 100 by say the dollar hong kong has done this with the greenback since the early 1980s bulgaria has done the same thing with the euro for more than 20 years several countries in africa are pegged to the euro needless to say in none of these cases are budgets taxes government spending and financial regulations coordinated with the u s or the eu the euro will eventually fail because it obliges germany to bail out profligate countries like greece no it won t and no it doesn t back in the 1970s washington refused to bail out new york city when it was on the verge of bankruptcy even though they share a common currency the euro would do just fine if authorities took to heart the following fundamental but out of fashion truths money is not an instrument for guiding an economy it isn t similar to the steering wheel of a car attempts to misuse it in this way retard economic progress countries with stable trustworthy money always do better than those with weak currencies always too many times american and european central banks have tried to use monetary policy to overcome structural barriers to growth money measures value the way a clock measures time money works best when it has a fixed value just as markets work best with fixed weights and measures the best way to achieve a stable trustworthy currency is to tie it to a fixed weight of gold contrary to myth this no more restricts the size of an economy than the 12 inches in a foot restricts the size of a building a contractor may wish to construct four thousand years of experience have proven that a gold standard works better than anything else robert mundell the nobel prize winning economist regarded as the euro s godfather believed that his conception would lead to a stronger more prosperous europe and would become a global alternative to the dollar that would force the authorities of both currencies to pursue sound monetary policies he never imagined that both would remain in

disclosed additionally the t south pipeline rupture at the beginning of the fourth quarter has restricted flows physically or by price related elective reductions during the fourth quarter of 2018 during significant portions of these periods of restriction the company s production had been limited to less than half of its productive capacity following an unplanned 22 day outage of the mcmahon processing facility in january 2019 chinook has returned its production to a largely unrestricted flow and is currently producing approximately 4 500 boe d projected adjusted funds flow for chinook for 2018 is estimated at 4 2 million or 0 02 per weighted average basic common share outstanding chinook exited 2018 with approximately 2 0 million in working capital deficit during 2018 chinook remained committed to capital discipline and cost control while continuing to develop its large montney position at its birley umbach property the company drilled and completed two 2 0 net vertical wells on a 21 20 5 net section parcel of contiguous montney rights at martin located five kilometres north of chinook s main montney land block at birley to determine the existence thickness and quality of pay in the montney interval these vertical wells were drilled six kilometres apart and more than 12 kilometres north and east of the nearest montney wells drilled to date each well encountered approximately 225 metres of total montney thickness compared to approximately 238 metres at birley the quality of the reservoir encountered particularly in the top 75 metres of the montney exceeded expectations with some of the best and most consistent hydrocarbon charged porosity seen on wireline log data in the entire area each well was perforated to obtain pressure information and will be fully abandoned in the first half of 2019 to satisfy flow through financing obligations chinook is very encouraged by these results and believes a significant extension to the productive montney fairway exists on company lands thus further expanding its future horizontal montney drilling inventory chinook remains committed to improving its cost structure and will see its office related expenses decrease in 2019 primarily through the conclusion of its current office lease and lease of new space at current market rates additionally the company continues to lever its existing assets and has completed a transportation agreement for the partial use of its 12 aitken creek pipeline the agreement will commence on the initial delivery of gas anticipated to be late 2019 or early 2020 and will continue for a minimum period of two years minimum gathering charges will total approximately 1 6 million annually as western canadian natural gas price weakness continues related to export capacity constraints including t south restrictions the company remains cautious in deploying further capital consequently 2019 will see a minimal capital program until such time as commodity prices improve to constructive levels management and the board of directors will make adjustments to the capital program in response to changing market conditions chinook has recently renewed its 10 million demand credit facility the next scheduled semi annual review is scheduled for may 2019 2018 independent reserves evaluation mcdaniel associates consultants ltd mcdaniel evaluated all of

believe outlook potential target and similar words suggesting future events or future performance in addition statements relating to reserves are deemed to be forward looking statements as they involve the implied assessment based on certain estimates and assumptions that the reserves described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated and can be profitably produced in the future in particular this news release contains without limitation forward looking statements pertaining to chinook s belief that a significant extension to the productive montney fairway exists on its lands

from any estimates or projections of future performance or results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements these risks and uncertainties include without limitation that the budgeted capital program for 2019 which is subject to the discretion of the board of directors of chinook will not be amended in the future volatility of commodity prices currency fluctuations risks associated with oil and gas exploration development exploitation production marketing and transportation loss of markets imprecision of reserve and resource estimates environmental risks competition from other

effective december 31 2018 as prepared by its independent evaluator chinook s audit of its 2018 annual consolidated financial statements is not yet complete and accordingly all financial amounts referred to in this news release are unaudited and represent management s estimates readers are advised that these financial estimates are subject to audit and may be subject to change as a result highlights proved producing reserves decreased 16 year over year an amount approximately equal to production during the period total proved reserves decreased 1 year over year and the all in fd a

proved and total proved plus probable reserves decreased 38 30 and 15 respectively driven by an average 25 reduction to forecasted five year bc plantgate gas prices unaudited 2018 year end results chinook s average daily production for 2018 was 3 719 boe d and the company exited 2018 at approximately 3 500 boe d through december chinook s production was significantly impacted by third party restrictions during 2018 the company experienced approximately four months of production restriction in the first and second quarters of 2018 due to the oak pipeline integrity issue previously disclosed additionally the t south pipeline rupture at the beginning of the fourth quarter has restricted flows physically or by price related elective reductions during the fourth quarter of 2018 during significant portions of these periods of restriction the company s production had been limited to less than half of its productive capacity following an unplanned 22 day outage of the mcmahon processing facility in january 2019 chinook has returned its production to a largely unrestricted flow and is currently producing approximately 4 500 boe d projected adjusted funds flow for chinook for 2018 is estimated at 4 2 million or 0 02 per weighted average basic common share outstanding chinook exited 2018 with approximately 2 0 million in working capital deficit during 2018 chinook remained committed to capital discipline and cost control while continuing to develop its large montney position at its birley umbach property the company drilled and completed two 2 0 net vertical wells on a 21 20 5 net section parcel of contiguous montney rights at martin located five kilometres north of chinook s main montney land block at birley to determine the existence thickness and quality of pay in the montney interval these vertical wells were drilled six kilometres apart and more than 12 kilometres north and east of the nearest montney wells drilled to date each well encountered approximately 225 metres of total montney thickness compared to approximately 238 metres at birley the quality of the reservoir encountered particularly in the top 75 metres of the montney exceeded expectations with some of the best and most consistent hydrocarbon charged porosity seen on wireline log data in the entire area each well was perforated to obtain pressure information and will be fully abandoned in the first half of 2019 to satisfy flow through financing obligations chinook is very encouraged by these results and believes a significant extension to the productive montney fairway exists on company lands thus further expanding its future horizontal montney drilling inventory chinook remains committed to improving its cost structure and will see its office related expenses decrease in 2019 primarily through the conclusion of its current office lease and lease of new space at current market rates additionally the company continues to lever its existing assets and has completed a transportation agreement for the partial use of its 12 aitken creek pipeline the agreement will commence on the initial delivery of gas anticipated to be late 2019 or early 2020 and will continue for a minimum period of two years minimum gathering charges will total approximately 1 6 million annually as western canadian natural gas price weakness continues related to export capacity constraints including t south restrictions the company remains cautious in deploying further capital consequently 2019 will see a minimal capital program until such time as commodity prices improve to constructive levels management and the board of directors will make adjustments to the capital program in response to changing market conditions chinook has recently renewed its 10

assumes no obligation to update these forward looking statements use of non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure we present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance this measurement is not recognized in accordance with u s gaap and should not be viewed as an alternative to u s gaap measures of performance the presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items we define adjusted ebitda as net loss income plus a income tax expense b interest expense net c depreciation and amortization and d loss income on foreign currency exchange we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in assessing our ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of our operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends however this measure should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income or other measures of performance determined in accordance with u s gaap moreover adjusted ebitda as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation our management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions adjusted ebitda is also used by securities analysts lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry for example interest expense can be highly dependent on a company s capital structure debt levels and credit ratings therefore the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies in addition the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate as a result effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under u s gaap some of these limitations include it does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments or foreign exchange gain loss it does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for working capital it does not reflect significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our outstanding debt it does not reflect payments made or future requirements for income taxes and although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or paid in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements or payments investors are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons the company considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis for more information

investors wariness is understandable the s p tsx composite index and s p 500 composite index both hit 52 week lows in late december sparking fears regarding the direction of the economy and according to a poll conducted for the toronto based financial planning standards council in january increasing clients stress about their ability to balance debt expenses and savings that poll found 42 of canadians expect the economy will get worse survey participants over age 55 were the most pessimistic but younger people and those with children below the age of majority were deeply worried about the state of their finances and the rising cost of living markets began to climb days before jan 1 and into the first three weeks of this year but recession focused debate about the state of canada s economy continued to make headlines as well both the organization for economic co operation and development and the international monetary fund imf forecast that canada s economic growth will slow in january the imf lowered its 2019 forecast to 1 9 from 2 due to persistent inter country trade tension and rising interest rates pessimism among investors is not surprising especially given that many global issues last year were eyebrow raising says jeff weniger asset allocation strategist with wisdomtree asset management inc in chicago those issues include political conflict in emerging nations and europe and slowing economic growth in canada for 2019 weniger foresees a relatively healthy global backdrop concerns about a recession are probably a little premature for december the investment funds institute of canada ific reported a 51 8 billion or 3 5 drop in mutual fund assets in the final four months of 2018 assets increased only in november furthermore annual net sales of money market funds which are considered low risk investments surged in 2018 to 2 7 billion more than 1 000 higher than 2017 s sales paul bourque president and ceo of ific in toronto says the mutual fund asset base still stands at just over 1 4 trillion according to ific s first annual investment funds report released in january total canadian investment fund assets for both mutual funds and etfs was 1 58 trillion in 2018 with etfs accounting for 156 7 billion bourque says the market effect as opposed to redemptions had the largest impact on mutual fund asset levels in december he anticipates balanced funds and asset allocation products will continue to attract assets and that liquid alt products also may play an important role in the coming years etfs in canada had net inflows of almost 2 4 billion in december there was notable focus on fixed income products which accounted for almost 1 4 billion in inflows for the month and more than 6 billion for the year there was massive flow into investment grade bonds which are a safe haven asset class says mark noble senior vice president of etf strategy with horizons etfs management canada inc in toronto fixed income wasn t quite the seller in 2018 it had been in 2016 and 2017 but defensive by nature and in the second half of 2018 there was a lot of money coming into broad fixed income overall investors aren t sure where to turn horizons 2019 q1 investor sentiment survey found that financial advisors collectively have a relatively upbeat outlook for potential portfolio returns for this quarter with 56 of those polled remaining bullish on canadian equities and 67 positive on u s equities in contrast investors bullishness on all major north american indices fell by 15 or more from the final quarter of 2018 and also were negative on emerging markets and cannabis stocks navigating the investment picture and how things set up going into this year has been difficult says james mccreath portfolio manager at the mccreath group a unit of bmo nesbitt burns inc in calgary we re optimistic the market always has periods of correction along with encouraging clients to think long term mccreath focuses on strategies that include canadian companies with good dividends and global revenue reach as well as some u s and global exposure both he and frank danielson senior financial planner with danielson group wealth management a unit of assante capital management ltd in vancouver recommend that clients stay the course rather than make major tactical portfolio adjustments many of mccreath s clients who contribute to rrsps do so throughout the year fund management and wealth management companies are focused on offering more balanced disciplined options that aim to mitigate risk jon kilfoyle senior vice president of ig investments a unit of investors group inc s private wealth management division in winnipeg predicts investors will look at increasing global exposure and responsible investments as well as seek active allocation funds that have broad mixes of securities to help deal with short term risks tim huver head of product americas with vanguard investments canada inc in toronto predicts further movement toward niche investments and in the face of market volatility he too foresees greater focus on diversified products we have seen increased adoption in our asset allocation products huver says they are the fastest growing rather than offer traditional funds with specific exposure to say canadian equities or fixed income vanguard assembles portfolios of etfs that offer exposure to various asset classes and geographical regions he says weniger says investors overall approach to fixed income will be an interesting mixed bag depending on how interest rates move globally both the u s federal reserve board and the bank of canada have stressed their cautious approaches we have two etfs that are tsx listed weniger says one is shorter duration and one is longer and you can flip a coin as to which direction advisors will go with those within equities weniger is watching emerging markets how trade fears will play out and possible currency plays while the loonie is attractive
2019 bloomberg finance lp it s almost as though the december stock market massacre never happened the s p 500 is up over 9 year to date and above the level before the last fateful rate hike by the fed so which move was the anomaly the downward move in december or the rebound in january certain developments suggest the former first the fed has turned investor friendly to put it kindly the communications strategy previously employed by chairman powell left much room for improvement in the opening song of the hit musical hamilton aaron burr dispenses some advice to a young alexander hamilton talk less smile more don t let them know what you re against or what you re for the financial markets sang those words to chairman powell in q4 last year and he seems to have listened within a few short weeks powell pivoted from suggesting that the current fed funds rate was a long way from neutral to his recent comments indicating a more data dependent fed actual inflation data for example is going to carry a greater weight in their decision making than expected inflation powell couldn t ignore the markets forever his dovish turn spurred a massive move in short term interest rates interest rate futures no longer price in further increases in the fed funds rate for 2019 iii capital management bloomberg lp a friendlier fed is significant lower nominal short term rates mean lower real yields assuming the inflation rate does not start to drift higher the risk free real rate sets the bar for all investments if an investor can earn an inflation adjusted yield of 1 that becomes the benchmark for returns risker investments demand a premium to that rate who would buy a risky asset if the expected return was the same as the risk free one stocks look more attractive when interest rates are low lower interest rates also help reduce pressure on emerging market corporates and sovereigns higher us interest rates were a major contributing factor to the weakness across many emerging markets in 2018 another outcome from an easier fed could be a weaker us dollar a weaker dollar would help domestic exporters and help the trade balance that has gotten so much attention from washington as of late the fed also provided clarity on the expected size of its balance sheet over the next few years the current policy is to let 50 billion of treasury bonds and agency mbs runoff every month also knows as qt or quantitative tightening the fed clarified that the optimal size of its balance sheet would be larger than many investors previously thought this means qt will end sooner rather than later which is good news to the bond market investors were worried about the fed draining bank reserves too quickly that worry is fading according to a research report released to institutional investors last week jp morgan anticipates the fed may return to buying us treasuries as early as 2020 to achieve its target balance sheet level the fed balance sheet runoff has been a huge technical event hanging over the market the announcement from the fed removed a lot of uncertainty there was another meaningful development in january the outlook for china improved yes the current economic data stinks but the policy response from the government was meaningful chinese authorities announced new tax cuts greater support for state owned enterprises more infrastructure spending and lower reserve requirements for banks to stimulate growth there were also some positive developments in the tariff negotiations china accounts for more than 30 of global growth it matters to everyone despite what some believe good news for china is good news for everyone including the us a lot has changed in the last few months the market capitulation at the end of 2018 surprised investors the strong rebound in january was equally confusing sometimes violent moves in markets are technical in nature sometimes they are fundamental looser global monetary policy led by the fed and fiscal stimulus in china is fundamental the outlook got better even if the data didn t and that what matters to markets
by introduction in recent weeks and in quick succession alexandria ocasio cortez promoted a top marginal tax rate of 70 percent on the part of incomes of the super rich over 10 million elizabeth warren proposed a wealth tax on ultra millionaires and billionaires and bernie sanders revealed his for the 99 8 proposal that would expand the estate tax on the wealthiest 0 2 percent of families these proposals are not schemes to soak the rich nor are they primarily about collecting revenue rather they provide the basis for meaningful tax reform whose twin goals are reducing extreme income and wealth inequality and protecting american democracy from the predations of wealthy plutocrats in the 34 years between 1946 and 1980 new deal policies that included progressive income and estate taxation as well as financial reforms that regulated the accumulation of wealth led to rising wages for ordinary workers a decline in income inequality and a more equal distribution of wealth in the years since 1980 tax cuts for the wealthy the near extinction of the estate tax and the rollback of financial regulations have led to a boom in incomes and an explosion of wealth for america s ultra rich families together with the supreme court s 2010 citizens united decision that allowed large political contributions big corporations and rich individuals have used their wealth to protect their interests and to engage in philanthropy that indulges their impulses and imposes their preferences on society without any accountability to the public the recent tax proposals seek to redress this situation by reducing income and wealth inequality preventing the emergence of an aristocracy of inherited wealth and defending american democracy against an army of lobbyists and lawyers paid to undermine it representative ocasio cortez s proposed 70 percent marginal tax rate on annual income above 10 million will begin to reverse this marginal tax rates and high marginal taxes on annual incomes over 10 000 000 what are marginal tax rates there is much confusion over marginal tax rates many people think that a married couple with joint income of say 77 500 and in the 22 percent tax bracket pays 22 percent of their total income in federal income taxes but that is incorrect here is a simple example to help you understand how marginal tax rates or tax brackets actually work table 1 shows actual tax brackets for a married couple filing taxes jointly on their 2018 income to keep things simple let s suppose that they had a joint income of 19 150 here is how marginal tax rates work the marginal tax rate on incomes of 1 to 19 050 is 10 percent so this married couple pays only 10 percent of the first 19 050 of their income that comes to 1 905 in taxes however they have a joint income of 19 150 which puts them 100 over the cut off for the 10 percent rate and puts them in the 12 percent tax bracket but they do not pay 12 percent of their total income in taxes because 12 percent is a marginal tax rate they pay 12 percent only on the additional 100 or an extra 12 their total income tax rises from 1 905 to 1 917 figure 1 depicts the highest marginal tax rate on top labor income in every year from 1950 to 2018 this tax is paid only on the part of the income that falls in the top tax bracket three things stand out marginal tax rates on top incomes have varied widely top tax rates were as high as 70 percent in the late 1960s and 1970s and top tax rates even exceeded 70 percent in some periods the historical record suggests that a 70 percent top marginal tax rate is neither unheard of nor very radical table 1 joint filers tax rates source internal revenue service what is the optimal tax rate on top labor incomes top marginal tax rates in the united states have been applied only to exceptionally high incomes they applied only to the super rich and not to the merely rich like doctors professors system analysts managers of small and medium sized businesses or others who draw incomes in the hundreds of thousands of dollars this is also true of the proposal from representative ocasio cortez it would tax only the part of an individual s annual income that is over 10 million at a 70 percent rate there are three things economists think about when setting the top marginal rate on super high earnings first there is the possibility that an increase in the tax rate will reduce the actual economic activity of high income earners piketty saez and stantcheva 2011 point out that studies have not been able to show convincing evidence in the short or medium run of large actual real economic activity responses of upper earners to tax rates there is not much concern that a tax rate of 70 percent on the part of an ultra high earner s income over 10 million will lead them to reduce effort manny machado may be the exception as a phillies fan i m concerned about his attitude but i don t think whether he hustles at third base or not will affect the economy second high income individuals can hire high priced tax lawyers and accountants to help them dodge income taxes reported upper income earners respond to tax rates whenever loopholes in the tax code let them avoid paying their fair share of taxes by changing the form of compensation e g recharacterizing compensation from ordinary income as capital gains income taxed at a lower rate reducing cash compensation in exchange for access to the company jet disguising vacation travel as business travel or by actual tax evasion e g shifting income to offshore accounts in tax havens tax avoidance behavior responds to the design of the tax code and this is something congress can control the current us tax code has many loopholes and offers countless opportunities for avoidance but the tax system can be changed and the possibilities for avoiding taxes reduced in particular broadening the tax base to include all forms of income applying the same tax rate across forms of income ensuring that taxes on corporate profits are the same for profits booked in the united states and those held offshore and increasing tax enforcement can greatly reduce tax avoidance if congress does not close the loopholes in the tax code to rule out opportunities for those with extraordinarily high incomes to engage in tax avoidance there is little point in enacting a 70 percent marginal tax rate the third consideration is the effect of the top tax rate on the effort the highest earners put into bargaining for higher pay bargaining efforts are not productive and do not increase the size of the economic pie indeed they are wasteful and since they don t lead to an expansion of gdp they are zero sum in the sense that higher compensation for the top earners leaves less for other workers high marginal top tax rates reduce the incentive that those earning say 10 million have to expend the effort to bargain for an additional million in pay at today s 37 percent top marginal tax rate another million dollars in pay will increase after tax income by 630 thousand at a top marginal tax rate of 70 percent after tax income will increase by 300 000 less than half that amount if as a result high earning individuals forego the additional million dollars in compensation businesses will have that money available for other purposes including raising wages the main argument against a high marginal tax rate on the incomes of ultra rich individuals is that such tax rates sap the work effort and entrepreneurial activity of these super high earners this the argument goes slows economic growth and in the end hurts both workers and the economy lower top marginal tax rates it is argued spur greater work effort and enterprise and increase economic growth but as jared bernstein shows in figure 2 there does not appear to be a systematic relationship between top marginal tax rates and the growth rate of per capita gdp on the other hand large cuts in top marginal tax rates in the 1980s led to a surge in pre tax incomes of ultra high earners this is consistent with the argument that the lower tax rate increased the efforts top earners put into bargaining for still higher pay for themselves and resulted in their receiving more pay if the cut in the top tax rate did not also result in an increase in gdp then this increase in top incomes came at the expense of individuals further down the income scale the divergence of productivity growth and wages of production and non supervisory employees beginning around 1980 is well known the decline in unionization rates over the last 35 years has reduced the effectiveness of unions in capturing a fair share of productivity gains for frontline workers as a result powerful corporate executives and elite professionals have been able to capture a larger and larger share of the economic pie so where have the productivity gains that have not been shared with frontline workers gone they have been captured by those at the top of the income distribution economic output that is gdp per person has almost doubled since 1980 but workers incomes have not kept pace if they had the average middle class household would have 15 000 a year more a 70 percent top tax rate can act as a restraint on the compensation of super high paid executives and others through its effect on the effort these individuals put into bargaining for pay above 10 million the net return to such bargaining will be much more modest with a 70 percent top marginal tax rate than under the current top rate of 37 percent looking at shares of total labor and capital income reveals that by 2014 the 117 million adults that make up the bottom 50 percent of the working age population had an average annual real income of 16 600 a minuscule increase of just 200 since 1980 taken together their income amounted to a 13 percent share of national income the share of national income going to the top 1 percent 2 3 million adults earning an average of 1 3 million a year was more than 20 percent and higher than the share of the bottom 50 percent figure 3 progressive taxes and transfers are effective in reducing income inequality the mildly progressive policies in effect in 2014 did reduce income inequality somewhat although the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act as well as executive branch efforts to reduce access to benefits has likely reduced this effect average income after taxes and transfers of the bottom 50 percent rose to 25 500 in 2014 income inequality increases wealth inequality the increase in income inequality has been a major contributor to the rise in wealth inequality over the past 40 years first rising income inequality increases the wage share of top income earning families and decreases the wage share of the bottom 90 percent second the savings rate out of the income of wealthy families is high over the period 1917 to 2012 the top 1 percent saved 20 to 25 percent of their income while the next 9 percent of families saved 15 percent the savings rate for the bottom 90 percent varied over this period from 5 percent to 5 percent on average these families saved 3 percent of their income but in recent years rising household debt mortgage debt credit card debt and student loan debt has reduced the savings rate of these families to close to zero third the rise in debt may itself be fueled by the increase in income inequality stagnant wages and rising housing costs have led to higher mortgage debt while non mortgage debt has increased as families borrow to make ends meet or pursue more schooling to achieve higher incomes thus the rapid increase in wealth of the richest families results in large measure from rising income inequality the rise in top incomes means that wealthy families consume less of their incomes and save much more than families lower on the income scale these savings are used to acquire assets and increase their wealth saez and zucman argue that this has had a snowballing effect that allows more wealth accumulation at the top conclusion notes world inequality report 2018 p 214 this article was a presentation to the congressional progressive caucus by eileen appelbaum co director center for economic and policy research

i made an rrsp contribution on monday but none of the money will be placed in equities until there s more assurance that stock prices are low enough to reflect the rising risks of substantial loss of capital the most immediate concern is that u s corporate profit guidance has been slashed to the point where the next earnings season is expected to show the first annual decline in profits in three years i m not convinced that at this late stage of the market cycle investors will take that well hopes remain for recovery in earnings growth for the second half of 2019 but morgan stanley equity strategist michael wilson notes that stock prices have not adjusted down to account for reductions in profit expectations noting the deterioration in earnings growth expectations over the past few months according to the latest analyst forecasts first quarter earnings are expected to contract 1 7 per cent strangely i see much less acknowledgement of this growth deterioration with everyone so focused on and stock price trends mr wilson said in a research report this week a big part of our equity strategy discipline is listening to what the market is telling us and we acknowledge that the recent surge in price and breadth is a positive signal about the future however earnings revisions have been some of the worst we ve ever observed in terms of breadth and velocity virtually every sector and region of the world is seeing downward revisions making it difficult to explain them away as a temporary function of trade tensions and or the government shutdown in the u s mr wilson s u k britain based colleague andrew sheets in a separate research report added that against renewed optimism there is real fundamental weakness both in growth and earnings trends the pessimism is not limited to morgan stanley credit suisse s prominent strategist andrew garthwaite published a report this week warning investors that corporate debt is approaching dangerous levels and that this has yet to factor into stock prices nomura issued a report predicting lacklustre retail sales growth in china this year after weak consumption during the 2019 lunar new year holidays that just wrapped up a slower chinese economy is not a good sign for canadian investors particularly those with resource related investments as the domestic earnings season heats up only 47 of 239 s p tsx composite members have reported fourth quarter earnings but so far the results have been uninspiring profits have come in 1 7 per cent below expectations and sales growth is running a meagre 0 75 per cent ahead of forecasts the global market rally that began on march 9 2009 turns 10 years old in less than a month bay street and wall street experts are fond of telling us that bull markets don t die of old age but the bulk of the rally s gains are almost certainly behind us for investors with a three year time horizon the surety of fixed income returns seems for now a more attractive option than trying to squeeze the last drop of returns from increasingly volatile markets i m pretty bearish at the moment but i hold all market related opinions loosely they could change at any time a resolution of the u s china trade dispute would be a reason to lean back bullish and perhaps more important signs that economic stimulus in china was starting to work would alleviate a lot of fears about deteriorating

rate sensitive canadian utilities a big lift over the past six weeks the sector has rallied 13 7 per cent from its dec 24 lows which is impressive for a collection of companies known for dividends and steady financial results rather than spectacular growth and innovation but how much upside is left this question gained some urgency on friday after a couple of analysts downgraded several utilities

finds investors as bullish on u s treasuries as they ve been since 2016 ask globe investor question do you think that the current controversy with huawei will have any effect on the dividends paid by bce inc bce and telus corp t answer no both companies could face short term disruptions if the federal government decides for security reasons to ban china s huawei technologies from supplying equipment for fifth generation 5g wireless networks in canada but your bce and telus dividends are not in any danger on bce s fourth quarter conference call this week chief executive george cope said the company does not anticipate any significant capital spending or timing repercussions if as seems increasingly likely huawei is blocked from participating in 5g bce has not yet chosen a 5g supplier mr cope said and if there was a ban or we chose a different supplier than huawei for 5g we re quite comfortable all those developments would be addressed within our traditional capital intensity envelope and therefore no impact from a capital expenditure program outlook in a note to clients analyst maher yaghi of desjardins securities said that this assurance from management should soothe investors who have become more anxious about this topic in another sign of confidence bce raised its dividend by 5 per cent when it announced results this week signalling that the company sees no material risks to its financial outlook management continues to have strong controls in place to deliver on the company s stated 5 per cent dividend growth model mr yaghi said both bce and telus use huawei equipment in their existing 3g and 4g networks but the potential security vulnerabilities are greater with 5g and nobody expects huawei equipment to be banned from existing networks in canada national bank financial analyst adam shine said in a note as such a more significant and costly rip and replace effort is not anticipated to befall bell and telus mr shine said banning huawei from 5g would increase costs because the carriers would have to choose more expensive suppliers and might have to replace some of their recent spending but the potential impact is truly hard to quantify he said telus is scheduled to release fourth quarter results on feb 14 when it is expected to comment on the potential impact of a huawei 5g ban john heinzl do you have a question for globe investor send

modern monetary theory mmt is getting significant media attention these days after alexandria ocasio cortez said in an interview that it should be a larger part of our conversation when it comes to funding the green new deal according to mmt the government can spend what it needs without worrying about deficits mmt expert and bernie sanders advisor prof stephanie kelton says the government actually creates money when it spends the real limit on spending is not an artificially imposed debt ceiling but a lack of labor and materials to do the work leading to generalized price inflation only when that real ceiling is hit does the money need to be taxed back and then not to fund government spending but to shrink the money supply in an economy that has run out of resources to put the extra money to work predictably critics have been quick to rebut calling the trend to endorse mmt disturbing and a joke that s not funny in a february 1st post on the daily reckoning brian maher darkly envisioned bernie sanders getting elected in 2020 and implementing quantitative easing for the people based on mmt theories to debunk the notion that governments can just print the money to solve their economic problems he raise the specter of venezuela where money is everywhere but bare essentials are out of reach for many the storefronts are empty unemployment is at 33 and inflation is predicted to hit 1 000 000 by the end of the year blogger arnold kling also pointed to the venezuelan hyperinflation he described mmt as the doctrine that because the government prints money it can spend whatever it wants until it can t he said to me the hyperinflation in venezuela exemplifies what happens when a country reaches the it can t point the country is not at full employment but the government can t seem to spend its way out of difficulty somebody should ask these mmt rock stars about the venezuela example i m not an mmt rock star and won t try to expound on its subtleties i would submit that under existing regulations the government cannot actually create money when it spends but that it should be able to in fact mmters have acknowledged that problem but it s a subject for another article what i want to address here is the hyperinflation issue and why venezuelan hyperinflation and qe for the people are completely different animals what is different about venezuela venezuela s problems are not the result of the government issuing money and using it to hire people to build infrastructure provide essential services and expand economic development if it were unemployment would not be at 33 percent and climbing venezuela has a problem that the u s does not have and will never have it owes massive debts in a currency it cannot print itself namely u s dollars when oil its principal resource was booming venezuela was able to meet its repayment schedule but when oil plummeted the government was reduced to printing venezuelan bolivars and selling them for u s dollars on international currency exchanges as speculators drove up the price of dollars more and more printing was required by the government massively deflating the national currency it was the same problem suffered by weimar germany and zimbabwe the two classic examples of hyperinflation typically raised to silence proponents of government expansion of the money supply before venezuela suffered the same fate prof michael hudson an economic rock star who supports mmt principles has studied the hyperinflation question extensively he confirms that those disasters were not due to governments issuing money to stimulate the economy rather he writes every hyperinflation in history has been caused by foreign debt service collapsing the exchange rate the problem almost always has resulted from wartime foreign currency strains not domestic spending venezuela and other countries that are carrying massive debts in currencies that are not their own are not sovereign governments that are sovereign can and have engaged in issuing their own currencies for infrastructure and development quite successfully a number of contemporary and historical examples were discussed in my earlier articles including in japan china australia and canada although venezuela is not technically at war it is suffering from foreign currency strains triggered by aggressive attacks by a foreign power u s economic sanctions have been going on for years causing at least 20 billion in losses to the country about 7 billion of its assets are now being held hostage by the u s which has waged an undeclared war against venezuela ever since george w bush s failed military coup against president hugo chavez in 2002 chavez boldly announced the bolivarian revolution a series of economic and social reforms that dramatically reduced poverty and illiteracy and improved health and living conditions for millions of venezuelans the reforms which included nationalizing key components of the nation s economy made chavez a hero to millions of people and the enemy of venezuela s oligarchs nicolas maduro was elected president following chavez s death in 2013 and vowed to continue the bolivarian revolution like saddam hussein and omar qaddafi before him he defiantly announced that venezuela would not be trading oil in us dollars following sanctions imposed by president trump the notorious elliott abrams has now been appointed as special envoy to venezuela considered a criminal by many for covering up massacres committed by u s backed death squads in central america abrams was among the prominent neocons closely linked to bush s failed venezuelan coup in 2002 national security advisor john bolton is another key neocon architect advocating regime change in venezuela at a january 28 press conference he held a yellow legal pad prominently displaying the words 5 000 troops to colombia a country that shares a border with venezuela apparently the neocon contingent feels they have unfinished business there bolton does not even pretend that it s all about restoring democracy he said on fox news it will make a big difference to the united states economically if we could have american oil companies invest in and produce the oil capabilities in venezuela as president nixon said of u s tactics against allende s government in chile the point of sanctions and military threats is to squeeze the country economically killing the public banking revolution in venezuela it may be about more than oil which recently hit record lows in the market the u s hardly needs to invade a country to replenish its supplies as with libya and iraq another motive may be to suppress the banking revolution initiated by venezuela s upstart leaders the banking crisis of 2009 10 exposed the corruption and systemic weakness of venezuelan banks some banks were engaged in questionable business practices others were seriously under capitalized others were apparently lending top executives large sums of money at least one financier could not prove where he got the money to buy the banks he owned rather than bailing out the culprits as was done in the u s in 2009 the government nationalized seven venezuelan banks accounting for around 12 of the nation s bank deposits in 2010 more were taken over the government arrested at least 16 bankers and issued more than 40 corruption related arrest warrants for others who had fled the country by the end of march 2011 only 37 banks were left down from 59 at the end of november 2009 state owned institutions took a larger role holding 35 of assets as of march 2011 while foreign institutions held just 13 2 of assets over the howls of the media in 2010 chavez took the bold step of passing legislation defining the banking industry as one of public service the legislation specified that 5 of the banks net profits must go towards funding community council projects designed and implemented by communities for the benefit of communities the venezuelan government directed the allocation of bank credit to preferred sectors of the economy and it increasingly became involved in the operations of private financial institutions by law nearly half the lending portfolios of venezuelan banks had to be directed to particular mandated sectors of the economy including small business and agriculture in an april 2012 article called venezuela increases banks obligatory social contributions u s and europe do not rachael boothroyd said that the venezuelan government was requiring the banks to give back housing was declared a constitutional right and venezuelan banks were obliged to contribute 15 of their yearly earnings to securing it the government s great housing mission aimed to build 2 7 million free houses for low income families before 2019 the goal was to create a social banking system that contributed to the development of society rather than simply siphoning off its wealth boothroyd wrote venezuelans are in the fortunate position of having a national government which prioritizes their life quality well being and development over the health of bankers and lobbyists pay checks if the 2009 financial crisis demonstrated anything it was that capitalism is quite simply incapable of regulating itself and that is precisely where progressive governments and progressive government legislation needs to step in that is also where the progressive wing of the democratic party is stepping in in the u s and why aoc s proposals evoke howls in the media of the sort seen in venezuela article i section 8 of the constitution gives congress the power to create the nation s money supply congress needs to exercise that power key to restoring our economic sovereignty is to reclaim the power to issue money from a commercial banking system that acknowledges no public responsibility beyond maximizing profits for its shareholders bank created money is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states including federal deposit insurance access to the fed s lending window and government bailouts when things go wrong if we the people are backing the currency it should be issued by the people through their representative government today however our government does not adequately represent the people we first need to take our government back and that is what aoc and her congressional allies are attempting to do
gold market in 2019 wgc versus lbma both the wgc and lbma published outlooks for the global economy and gold market in 2019 who is right wgc s outlook for gold in 2019 let s start from the world gold council wgc which published its 2019 outlook on january 10th as befits the organization representing industry s interests the wgc is bullish on gold prices no surprises here according to the institution the following trends will mainly shape the gold market in 2019 financial market instability monetary policy and the us dollar and structural economic reforms first the wgc expects higher levels of risk and uncertainty this year due to the elevated market volatility rising political and economic instability in europe think about brexit social unrest in france populist government in italy or secessionism in spain and potential higher inflation from protectionist policies all these factors are said to increase the likelihood of a global recession nudging investors toward gold as an effective portfolio diversifier and a safe haven second the wgc admits that although market risk will likely remain high higher interest rates and us dollar s strength could limit gold s upside however the organization believes that the greenback may be losing steam while the positive effect of higher federal funds rate on the dollar will diminish as the fed s monetary policy stance becomes neutral third the wgc argues that pro growth economic reforms implemented in india and china would support consumer demand and thus gold prices this claim is the weakest and we refuted many times the argument that consumer demand drives the gold prices actually the opposite is true i e consumers are price takers not price setters however we could sign under the previous two points we also believe that the dollar s upside is limited while the pace of fed s tightening is slowing down and we do agree that the level of political and market risks is somewhat higher than last year although we would not overestimate the europe s weakness despite its fragility it still grows lbma s global macroeconomic outlook for 2019 2020 let s move on now to the lbma s outlook actually the presented view was not formulated by the london bullion market association but by adam posen president of the peterson institute for international economics whose keynote speech from the lbma lppm conference in boston on 28 30th october 2018 was published in the recent issue of the alchemist we will analyze other articles in the next edition of the gold news monitor according to him there are four key trends to keep in mind for the coming two years a shift from financial risk to political risk the reinforcement of a long term negative productivity trend the increasing risk of inflation and economic and political turmoil in latin america first the author argues that the us turns isolationist and nationalist which lowers the political stability all around the world the uncertainty is higher while investment subdued we agree with that second the current protectionism and anti investment politics will aggravate the problem of sluggish productivity growth it s important not only because it implies slower economic growth but also because the economy has less room to run hot there is not fast technological progress which could counterbalance the inflationary pressure hence and this is the third point we have an inflation risk which could materialize in the second half of the year forcing the fed to more aggressive actions so far inflation has been limited but the upward risk exists certainly fourth although the fed s tightening cycle will not put all emerging markets into trouble latin america is particularly at risk think about the economic disaster in venezuela immigration crisis in columbia or many questions marks regarding bolsonaro s brazil taking all these factors into account posen is bullish on gold arguing that overall political economic framework will be at the margin pushing up values for gold a more politically uncertain environment incentives people to hold their assets in non currency assets a more inflationary environment even one not hugely inflationary but one with more upside risk to inflation is something that incentivises people to move into gold and other precious metals a more politically fragmented system where the risk of large currency swings is high further reinforces this a low productivity growth environment is one that reduces the relative gains of taking speculative risk in other forms of investment which should also move you towards gold implications for gold ladies and gentlemen we have a draw both the wgc and lbma alchemist s article by posen present convincing arguments that fundamentals are moving in the direction of gold although we question some of the details we agree with the general outlook for the gold market in 2019 this year might be indeed better for the yellow metal than 2018 we do not expect a global recession and a rally in gold prices but we do expect that 2019 will be more supportive for the gold prices at the margin if you enjoyed the above analysis and would you like to know

kindly ask you to take a moment to read the safe harbor statement on slide number 2 of our presentation let us now turn to slide number 3 of the presentation for a summary of our fourth quarter 2018 financial highlights in the three months ending december 31 2018 tce revenues amounted to 137 8 million 53 1 higher than the 90 million for the same period in 2017 adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter 2018 was 82 4 million versus 55 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 amounted to 30 3 million or 0 33 gain per share versus 21 5 million or 0 34 gain per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 this is our fifth consecutive profitable quarter our time charter equivalent rate during this quarter was 14 140 per day compared to 13 860 per day in the same quarter last year during q4 2018 our average daily operating expenses were at 3 938 per vessel per day during this quarter we concluded the refinancing of 248 million reducing the average margin of these facilities by 120 basis points we remain committed to refinancing debt at lower interest rates when such opportunities arise following the share repurchase program announced last november the company has purchased approximately 341 000 shares at an average price of 9 29 per share we have also committed financing for the procurement and installation of scrubbers of 140 million to be drawn during the rollout of our program in 2019 slide 4 shows a summary of our 2018 financial highlights adjusted ebitda for the full year of 2018 was at 260 9 million versus 128 million in 2017 adjusted net income for 2018 amounted to 86 1 million or 1 12 gain per share versus 4 3 million adjusted net loss or 0 07 loss per share in 2017 slide 5 graphically illustrates the changes in the company s cash balance during the fourth quarter the fleet generated free cash flow of 29 7 million after including debt proceeds and repayments from our refinancing activities capex payments for our acquisition and scrubber installments final payment of our deferred debt amounts and share repurchase program we arrived at a cash balance of 213 9 million at the end of the fourth quarter 2018 slide 6 highlights star bulk s strong liquidity position on the left hand side we present our fleetwide breakeven of 11 600 per vessel day which enables us to deleverage our balance sheet and create value for our shareholders even at relatively low average charter rates on the right hand side we provide a breakdown of the net debt position of star bulk which is currently close to 1 27 billion pro forma for the expected 60 of the refinancing of one ultramax vessel which is currently unlevered star bulk has no remaining equity capex for the three newcastlemax newbuilding vessels as there is committed financing in place for the remaining yard installments we expect to take delivery of these vessels during the first half of 2019 the graph on the bottom right hand side shows the positive trend in our adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income with five consecutive quarters of profitability please turn to slide 7 where we summarize our operational performance opex was at 3 938 per vessel per day for the quarter and 3 994 per vessel per day for 2018 as a whole net cash g a expenses were at 969 per vessel per day for the quarter and for 2018 g a expenses were at 1 004 per vessel per day a decrease of 8 year on year primarily attributed to synergies from the increase in the size of our fleet the combination of our in house management and the scale of the group enable us to provide our services at very competitive costs complemented by excellent ship management capabilities with star bulk consistently ranked among the top 3 managers evaluated by rightship slide 8 highlights that star bulk is one of the lowest cost operators among us listed dry bulk peers based on latest publicly available information star bulk s operating expenses are approximately 15 below the industry average in addition we are very focused on having the highest standards of vessel safety and maintenance to meet the requirements of our most demanding clients in slide 9 we are providing an update on our scrubber program which is proceeding as scheduled total expected capex as of february 2018 is at 130 5 million the graph below illustrates the estimated breakdown of the payments by quarter based on current forward fx rates and expected milestones it is important to note that we have secured approximately 140 million of debt financing for the program which we will be drawing down gradually within 2019 we are currently completing the installation of scrubbers on 15 of our larger vessels and are continuing with preparatory work in numerous vessels in order to reduce off hire time we expect to have the entire fleet scrubber fitted by end of 2019 and we estimate about 5 off hires across our fleet for 2019 for scrubber installations slide 10 illustrates star bulk s employment coverage for the first quarter of 2019 we have fixed employment for approximately 70 of the days in the first quarter of 2019 at average tce rates of 12 954 per vessel day i will now pass the floor to our ceo petros pappas for a market update and his closing remarks petros pappas chief executive officer thank you christos please turn to slide 11 for a brief update of supply during 2018 a total of 28 2 million deadweight were delivered and 4 4 million deadweight were sent to demolition both the lowest in a decade for a 23 7 million deadweight net inflow of vessels or 2 9 a total of 32 7 million deadweight were reported by clarksons as firm orders and up to an additional 8 million deadweight were identified as lois or options during the year the order book currently stands between 11 and 12 of the fleet depending on how many lois and options will be exercised it is worth noting that the geared order book stands at just 6 6 of the fleet the average steaming speed of the dry bulk fleet was approximately 11 6 knots for the year during 2019 and 2020 the fleet is projected to expand at a similar pace to that of 2018 however due to projected scrubber installations and tanks cleaning off hires during 2019 and slow steaming increased scrapping during 2020 effective supply is unlikely to expand by more than 1 5 per annum let s now turn to slide 12 for a brief update of demand according to clarksons the 2018 dry bulk trade is estimated to have grown by 2 4 in tons and 2 8 in ton miles this represents a downward revision to our last earnings call and is mainly caused by weaker iron ore and grain trade activity during the fourth quarter strong steel prices and profit margins during the first three quarters of 2018 supported a 6 4 increase in global steel production during 2018 this was led by china which registered growth of 9 8 during the year china s environmental restrictions have also led to a 4 year on year decline in domestic iron ore production despite a combination of strong steel production and lower domestic iron ore production china imports of iron ore experienced a decrease of 1 in 2018 as a result of increased use of scrap and destocking of iron ore stockpiles brazil iron ore exports expanded by only 1 7 during 2018 due to poor weather conditions political unrest and the anglo american pipe leakage incident in the first half of the year australian iron ore exports are estimated to have increased by 1 6 in 2018 with q4 estimated to have contracted by 2 6 year on year according to clarksons iron ore trade decreased by 0 1 in tons and 0 5 in ton miles during 2018 china coal imports increased by 3 6 during 2018 with q4 seeing a contraction of more than 20 due to import restrictions placed thermal coal imports during 2018 received support from a 7 4 increase in electricity generation weak hydropower generation and relatively flat domestic coal production at the same time indian coal imports are estimated to have increased by 17 7 during 2018 according to clarksons thermal and coking coal trade increased by 3 8 in tons and 5 in ton miles during 2018 the us china trade dispute and the imposition of 25 tariffs on us imports by china has taken its toll on soybean trade this year brazil soybean exports increased by 23 partly picking up the slack ahead of the us export season which has underperformed heavily during the last months chinese imports of soybeans ended down 7 8 year on year in 2018 according to clarksons grain trade including soybeans increased by 0 6 in tons and contracted by 0 6 in ton miles during 2018 during 2019 total dry bulk trade in ton miles is projected to expand at a slightly higher pace to that of 2018 mainly on the back of a rebound in grains trade unfortunately the brazilian mine accident in january 2019 implies further iron ore disruptions the extent of which are still too early to quantify furthermore the imo sulfur regulation is now less than 11 months away and we expect it will lead to a decrease in overall supply of vessels through slow steaming and accelerated scrapping affecting markets positively i will now pass the floor over to the operator to answer any questions you may have questions and answers operator thank you your first question comes from the line of amit mehrotra from deutsche bank please go ahead and ask your question your line is now open christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst this is chris snyder from deutsche bank so first question is around q1 bookings they came in a bit better than expectations given the recent weakness especially for the larger segments was this due to timing or vessel locations or are you guys seeing a firmer day rate environment than maybe what the ship brokers are quoting hamish norton president chris hi chris can you please repeat the question i didn t hear the beginning christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst so q1 bookings came in better than expectations given the recent weakness especially for the larger segments was this due to timing or just vessel locations or are you guys seeing a firmer day rate environment maybe than what the ship brokers are quoting petros pappas chief executive officer well firmer bookings you mean the fixtures that we have already done for q1 christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst yes petros pappas chief executive officer yes well as we do every year after august of every year until november we basically try to fix short term periods that go through q1 and part of q2 it s a strategy we follow every year because most of the time seasonally q1 and part of q2 are relatively slow so despite the fact that we were potentially expecting a cease of trade war we thought that fixing at levels of around 13 000 was a decent level and therefore we went ahead and fixed i mean had we not fixed today we re facing a levels of between 5 000 and 7 000 christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst okay thank you for that color and then next so a few ports have announced open loop scrubber bans in their territorial waters or inland waterways can you just talk about how this changes scrubber utilization i think it would be helpful if you could talk about just how this changes the number of scrubber operating days for capes and panamax vessels as we all try to think about returns petros pappas chief executive officer chris when we did our calculations on scrubbers we did not take into account port time at all we were only taking into account ship days and therefore it does not make a difference in the computation we have done that these bans don t make a difference at all in our calculation so actually it s going to potentially be even better because there s going to be many ports that have no ban on open loop scrubbers and there we will be able to use them and also please keep in mind that in ports the consumption is like 2 5 tons per vessel where at sea it can be anywhere between 25 tons and 50 tons and therefore this consumption is very very minor christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst okay thank you for that and then just a follow up on the scrubbers has there been any demand or outreach from charters looking to lock in scrubber fitted vessels on term contracts obviously you guys would be giving up some upside locking some of these ships away but it will also allow you to demonstrate the positive economics of the scrubber investment is there any any outreach on that front petros pappas chief executive officer there s been a number of charters that have approached us but our strategy is different we are intending to go toward voyage business meaning that we will source the cargos ourselves and therefore we will attempt to keep most of the benefit for ourselves christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst and could you provide any color on just kind of the premium if you were to lock a scrubber fitted vessel on to a time charter what kind of premium you would be looking at just relative to kind of the broader market petros pappas chief executive officer well we ve seen charters offer hamish norton president yes are you looking at the premium we expect or the premium that charters are currently offering christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst the premium that charters are currently offering i know it s obviously below what you guys expect but i would just be interested to see what they re offering petros pappas chief executive officer yes well it s charters are asking between 30 and 50 of the premium but they are offering all kinds of deals like they will offer to install the scrubber and make the profits themselves for up to five years without giving up any further premium other offers we ve seen is to install the scrubber and pay 1 000 or 2 000 more and then there s others that are saying ok you install the scrubber and you can get between 50 and 70 of the benefit and then there s others that say we will install the scrubber we will get the initial benefit until we repay the scrubber and then we can split 50 50 or 70 30 or whatever so there s all kinds they re all over the place christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst okay i appreciate all the color that does it for me thanks for the time guys petros pappas chief executive officer thank you chris operator thank you we will now take our next question please go ahead your line is now open randy giveans jefferies analyst hey guys randy giveans from jefferies how are you all hamish norton president fine randy giveans jefferies analyst excellent all right so you repurchased 3 1 million of sblk shares during 4q 18 still i think 47 million or so in remaining authorization so with the shares trading at a steep discount to nav about 10 below that average price that you repurchased shares in 4q are additional share repurchases the number 1 use of cash going forward other than the scrubber financing hamish norton president certainly other than the scrubber acquisition share repurchases are the only use of cash that we currently are contemplating other than of course normal repayment of debt petros pappas chief executive officer sure just to add to that in general we are conservative in that we want to make sure that we always have a high cash balance to make sure that we are able to survive any dry bulk market especially until we reach 2020 randy giveans jefferies analyst yes that s fair and now can you discuss some of the equity incentive program how that was decided on so specifically how was the 120 million to 300 million outperformance and the 4 million shares kind of determined based on our math it looks like the outperformance would be about 3 000 to 7 000 per day per vessel to get to those kind of aforementioned numbers so with that scrubbers could easily attain that kind of 3 000 to 7 000 day premium yet your press release stated the company takes the view that the current likelihood of vesting these rsus does not meet a quote unquote more likely than not standard so with all that what do you expect the outperformance to be for those scrubbers and then again if you can kind of touch on how you decided on those kind of outperformance metrics hamish norton president okay so randy that s a very complex question so first of all let me make it clear that the incentive program was not an initiative of management it was an initiative of the compensation committee and it was put together over a substantial period of time through discussions with management and because our compensation committee s aggregate iq is so high complexity was no obstacle to our compensation committee and the complexity of this plan blossomed without much limit so the answer is that it started out as a four year plan with higher limits and was reduced to a two year plan with the limits you see and the answer is we have great expectations for the performance of the scrubbers but in terms of meeting a more likely than not standard for the financial statements i think everybody agreed and in consultation with our auditors our auditors agreed that the outperformance called for by the plan did not meet the appropriate accounting standard and this is an accounting issue solely and i m sure you have seen other instances where the accounting didn t necessarily track everything that you might have expected of the business and that s basically why we included enough information so that you can make your own model based on your own assumptions we ll see what the outperformance is when we get to it randy giveans jefferies analyst excellent yes i was not doubting the iq of the compensation committee but for my low iq thank you for explaining that quick follow up on the scrubbers so what spread in dollars per ton are you using kind of to determine that payback period of one to two years maybe two and a half years and then secondly for the scrubber strategy is that driven more by economics or more by operational decisions for fuel compatibility or fuel availability issues that you maybe foresee hamish norton president okay so first of all there is a forward market in heavy fuel oil and marine gas oil there is about to be or maybe has just developed a forward market for 0 5 fuel so there are forward prices for these fuels that can be used to calculate payback periods depending on your assumption about fuel availability engine consumption and how much of that premium the shipowner will get versus how much of that premium the charter will get if any but i mean we pay a lot of attention to the forward market and then our thinking was largely driven by economics because frankly in a free market the likelihood of there being a significant shortage of either low sulfur or high sulfur fuel oil is not very high randy giveans jefferies analyst got it all right well i will petros pappas chief executive officer randy i d like to randy this is petros i d like to add the couple of things here first of all operationally continuing with heavy fuel oil will not present any issues for us and that s extremely important we don t need to clean our tanks we don t need to try new fuels we don t need to use blends which may be incompatible with each other so operationally it s going to be exactly the same way as it was for us also legally because there s going to be a number of claims on any charters that transcend the 1st of january 2020 what kind of bunkers do the charters deliver the diesel or fuel what prices it s going to be extremely difficult legally for us it doesn t change we do with heavy fuel oil the second thing i want to talk about was that when we say financially yes we would like to make a profit and actually personally i think that if the price differential let s say is between 250 and 300 we may be able to repay the scrubbers within a year or so but the main financial consideration we have had in taking this decision was that we are hedging our future imagine if in january 2020 the market is actually not good we think it s going to be good because we think there s going to be slow steaming scrapping and stuff like that however and off hires however imagine a case where the market remains exactly the same as it is today in dollars per ton terms in dollars per ton terms it would mean that the guys that don t have scrubbers will actually have a higher cost and if they were making let s say 13 000 a day on a kamsarmax they may go down to 5 000 or 6 000 exactly because they will be paying higher bunker costs and these come out of those dollars per ton where the people that have scrubbers may be likely enough to face even lower heavy fuel oil prices and that means that even under bad market circumstances we may be able to make more than 13 000 a day so a major driver and consideration for this decision of ours was to be able to hedge and not only survive but do very well in a potentially slow market if the market is strong which we think it will be then we ll just make a lot of money and we ll be all happy and maybe we ll get some promote but if it is slow then we are securing the future of our company randy giveans jefferies analyst i like it well thank you so much for the in depth color that s it for me operator thank you our next question is now open please go ahead hamish norton president does that mean there are no more questions operator there are currently two more questions in the queue your line is now open hamish norton president okay max yaras morgan stanley analyst hi this is max yaras from morgan stanley can you guys hear me hamish norton president yes max yaras morgan stanley analyst all right thank you you guys did a really good job of covering wrapping up 2018 i was wondering if you could give me an update on year to date trades whether maybe coal trade bounced back post year end or how you see vale the vale incident kind of already affecting flows petros pappas chief executive officer so the question is about what vale is going to be doing and what will happen with coal trade max yaras morgan stanley analyst yes exactly what you re seeing so far this year petros pappas chief executive officer i think we are seeing exactly what you are seeing i think we are seeing a couple of we re seeing a major catastrophe in a dam which also cost lives and we re seeing potential disruptions in other mines not because there was an accident but because they want to go through testing those the stability of those mines and obviously this has a negative effect effect on the market this we hope and we expect is going to be a short term effect on the market but but even if it isn t and even if brazil or narvik or in norway or sept iles in canada cannot actually cover for those lost tons and i m using these three places because the ton miles are longer and one has to and china has to import those cargos let s say from australia which is the closest place to china for iron ore that i did actually the calculation and i said ok let s say that we have 30 million tons that needs to be imported from closer places what will the effect on the market be so i did this calculation i said ok 30 million tons means 150 vessels and the differential in sailing is 50 days per trip so that s 7 500 days if you divide that by 360 days of a year it means 21 vessels 21 vessels less needed because 30 million tons of iron ore will not be exported by brazil but may be exported by australia this the effect of that on demand is 1 25 so we re talking about 1 25 the psychological effect of course it s higher and also the fact that this happened during the slowest quarter of the year and as it is seasonally and that it happened within one quarter it has a bigger effect so it could be also potentially positive for the next quarters like if brazil if vale manages to recover from this problem we could see more exports toward the second half of the year or for example if other countries compensated for those 30 million tons or whatever it s going to be because brazil s iron content in iron ore is higher than from other countries it could be it could mean that more tons are needed to be imported from other countries to compensate and therefore that might to an extent compensate for the loss of the ton miles now regarding coal we see that two things first of all we see some bad weather in australia which has reduced exports and of course on the other hand this bad weather keeps vessels in port but the effect the negative effect on export i think is probably higher and we see something else which is very interesting we see china delaying there s no ban right now but there s a delay in some ports of coking coal and a vessel may arrive at a port and delay for like 50 days to get the license to discharge and i was wondering this afternoon why this may be happening and i thought maybe if the china the us china war is over china will have to import stuff from the us and therefore it is possible that the chinese are delaying coke imports from australia in order to be able to compensate from the us in case there is some agreement coming forth in the next few weeks if that happens then we would see a much stronger market obviously because the ton miles are going to be much higher so these are my answers on the two questions you posed max yaras morgan stanley analyst yes it s very interesting i really appreciate the color i heard you answer i believe it was randy s question that your current scrubber fitting program and repurchases are may be top priorities or the only priorities but just given your confidence and returns in the program just wondering if you re thinking about maybe acquiring more vessels or spreading that program out to other vessels that you don t even own how can you capture those returns above and beyond your current fleet does that make sense hamish norton president well look we have no current plans to acquire any vessels for cash as we ve done in the past if we see fleets that are available for sale for cash and shares where we can use our shares so as to acquire these fleets without increasing our leverage at all and without decreasing our cash balance per vessel we would consider that but we haven t seen anything recently and i don t think the probability of that sort of thing occurring soon is very high max yaras morgan stanley analyst sure but what do you think about installing scrubbers maybe on other companies vessels and some kind of profit share any way to kind of capture that high return potential hamish norton president sure we re in the market to do deals with other companies where we can install a scrubber on the ship and profit from that again there are lots of deals that would make sense from our point of view i don t know how likely those are going to end up being petros pappas chief executive officer yes of course if you think that we re going to be installing 110 scrubbers on our vessels within the year which is a major task if we were to charter in more vessels we would need to install more so it will make it even more difficult plus the cash flow expense because i don t think we can get loans on chartered in vessels we can as we did with our own fleet hamish norton president yes and also petros and i would have to go to welding school and it would take some time max yaras morgan stanley analyst fair enough thank you guys operator thank you we will now take our next question please go ahead your line is now open noah parquette jp morgan analyst hi it s noah parquette at jp morgan i wanted to ask you guys saw that report last week i think from the european commission to the imo and talking about environmental effects with scrubbers and there s been some growing movement toward that i wanted to get your thoughts on potential implications maybe out of that meeting in may or if there s any change to kind of the life cycle of scrubbers in your view and just i think that s coming out more in conversations now as a risk so just would love to hear your thoughts hamish norton president sure so first of all the scientific evidence is being really ignored in a lot of the popular and even the industry debate and the scientific evidence is basically that if you use a scrubber the wash water largely meets in most cases it meets european union standards for drinking water in every case it meets european union standards for surface waters and if you burn compliant fuel without a scrubber you re putting these heavy metals and these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into the air which then fall into the water so i mean it s not as though you re not contributing to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals if you don t use a scrubber just the contrary you re putting them into the air first before they go into the water but obviously we re concerned about the public relations aspect of this and it s taken some time but the clean shipping alliance 2020 is finally getting up to speed we re members there are a large number of other shipping companies who are members and we ll be doing our utmost to get the facts across and make sure that they are heard that being said the current initiatives by certain ports to ban operation of open loop scrubbers in port as petros said is not a major economic hit we were not counting on being able to use the scrubbers in any port when we did our analysis but we obviously would start to be concerned if the initiatives went beyond that and that s hopefully what the clean shipping alliance 2020 will be addressing noah parquette jp morgan analyst okay great and then just one question obviously everybody is looking at the demand impacts from vale is there anything on the supply side that we re maybe missing in terms of valemax utilization or any other things that could be part of the fall off petros pappas chief executive officer on the supply side well on the supply side you mean vessels or iron ore from vale noah parquette jp morgan analyst yes i mean will some of the valemax s utilization be impacted by this i mean it s hard for them to find other they re very specialized right so just kind of love to hear your thoughts petros pappas chief executive officer there is a few tens of all the vessels that we believe will be impacted by the fact that there was a company that is being accused of tampering with the vessels condition and i think that this will actually turn into having to scrap like 40 to 50 of those vessels that are still in the season that are like 25 year to 30 year old and i mean loading 50 000 or 100 000 tons of iron ore actually loading 30 000 tons per hour on iron ore capes is very is very stressful on those vessels and if they re not in tip top condition you can have more accidents occurring like the one that happened a couple of years ago so we believe that these vessels will be retired from circulation within the next 24 months at the most i see already six vessels six capes having been scrapped in the first 40 days of this year if this continued it would mean 45 for a year it won t continue like that obviously but six vessels of older vintage have been scrapped so we think that this is very important one other thing that i want to say is that with the slow market that we re seeing today there are benefits because nobody is ordering and scrapping is more incentivized so there s nothing bad without some good as the ancient greeks used to say noah parquette jp morgan analyst okay great thank you operator thank you we ll now take our next question please go ahead your line is now open magnus fyhr seaport global analyst yes hi this is magnus fyhr seaport global i just had one question to clarify on the vale delivery schedule valemax delivery schedule you mentioned that it s likely that these older vloc conversions be phased out in the next 24 months well will that not just be replaced by the large number of valemaxes on order that s delivering over the next two years or has anything changed there or do you think these vloc conversions will be scrapped ahead of the deliveries petros pappas chief executive officer well of course there is this vlocs that are coming between now and 2022 and that is something that possibly will not change unless if some of the options that have been declared are not that have not been declared yet are never declared otherwise yes we expect that these vessels will come in operation during the next three years or so magnus fyhr seaport global analyst okay great thanks for clarifying that petros pappas chief executive officer thank you operator thank you operator instructions there have been no further questions entered at this time please continue petros pappas chief executive officer nothing more

venezuela s central bank devalued the country s currency on jan 28 by 50 per cent eclipsing the parallel black market rate caracas venezuela when jose humberto vivas needs to trade dollars for venezuelan bolivars he usually flouts the nation s rigid exchange controls by turning to illegal currency traders but last week vivas put a few hundred dollars in his wallet and headed to an exchange house regulated by venezuela s socialist government lured by the seemingly improbable prospect of an official rate that is more inviting than the black market rate i haven t been here in years vivas said as he stood in line outside italcambio a normally lifeless exchange house in downtown caracas protected by tinted windows and an armed security guard who inspects customers ids there s a long wait here and it takes days to get the money transferred to your account but it might be worth it said vivas who makes a living from selling dairy products advertisement little noticed amid the turmoil unleashed by the opposition s renewed push to oust president nicolas maduro venezuela s central bank devalued the country s currency on jan 28 by 50 per cent eclipsing the parallel black market rate the government now buys 1 for 3 303 bolivars while the informal market buys them at 3 120 bolivars according to the website dolartoday it is the first time the official exchange rate has been higher than that of the black market since currency controls were put in place more than a decade ago analysts said the controls were implemented in 2003 by hugo chavez the late president who initiated venezuela s socialist system and have frequently made the simple task of exchanging money into a stressful ordeal that involves searching for illegal currency dealers logging into websites banned by the government and sending wire transfers to foreign banks but as maduro s government runs out of hard currency amid an onslaught of international pressure and economic sanctions it is tacking in a markedly capitalist direction encouraging venezuelans to sell their greenbacks to the local financial system in a statement issued jan 29 the central bank described the devaluation as an economic stabilization measure aimed at controlling hyperinflation by undermining the black market analysts called it a desperate gambit to raise hard cash in a country now beset by severe u s oil sanctions that could cost the government up to 11 billion in revenue over the next 12 months without one of its most important sources of income venezuela will be hard pressed to purchase food and other imports potentially worsening shortages and deepening its economic collapse russ dallen ceo at caracas capital markets said dollars could now come into venezuela s empty state coffers through state regulated wire transfers from the estimated 3 million venezuelan migrants who have fled the country s instability up until now they have mostly used black market traders to send an estimated 1 billion a year to loved ones but could be enticed into the official system if the official exchange rate stays favourable they are going for the diaspora dollars dallen said of maduro s administration the government is also attempting to gain more dollars from rich venezuelans and a few straggling tourists who use their foreign credit cards at the official exchange rate something that would have been unfeasible a few weeks ago but the strategy is controversial maduro s opponents argue that selling dollars to the government is tantamount to funding repression others say the move will not eliminate the longstanding spread between the two rates which has often allowed richer venezuelans to take advantage of the distortion and pocket juicy profits asdrubal oliveros an economic consultant based in caracas predicts the amount of money the venezuelan government can raise through currency markets will fall short of what it needs to remedy its financial woes strict requirements mandated by u s sanctions could also force some foreign banks to stop funding credit card transactions in venezuela altogether as bank of america recently announced the government and its state owned entities currently owe around 150 billion to creditors around the world while the country s foreign currency reserves have fallen to just 8 billion forced to meet interest payments on the few remaining loans and bonds the government hasn t yet defaulted on the maduro administration must finance its huge budget deficit by printing even more bolivars further accelerating prices last year inflation in the south american country hit 1 million per cent hyperinflation is a fiscal problem oliveros said if you don t control your expenditures and reduce deficits you will not be able to tackle it meanwhile other obstacles could limit the central bank s efforts to raise dollars currently it takes four days an eternity in today s venezuela for the bolivars purchased at state regulated exchange houses to be deposited into a person s account cash exchanges have been impossible for months due to shortages of bolivar bills reliability speed and convenience carry a lot of weight in currency exchanges oliveros said last week dozens of people trying to sell small amounts of dollars and euros at the official rate were turned away from exchange houses after trading was suspended due to a glitch with the central bank s currency platform it s so frustrating said adolfo estanford a lawyer who had hoped to get 20 worth of bolivars he said he needed the money for food and transport everything here is so improvised he said i feel like i ve been made a fool of

you to take a moment to read the safe harbor statement on slide number 2 of our presentation let us now turn to slide number 3 of the presentation for a summary of our fourth quarter 2018 financial highlights in the three months ending december 31 2018 tce revenues amounted to 137 8 million 53 1 higher than the 90 million for the same period in 2017 adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter 2018 was 82 4 million versus 55 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 amounted to 30 3 million or 0 33 gain per share versus 21 5 million or 0 34 gain per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 this is our fifth consecutive profitable quarter our time charter equivalent rate during this quarter was 14 140 per day compared to 13 860 per day in the same quarter last year during q4 2018 our average daily operating expenses were at 3 938 per vessel per day during this quarter we concluded the refinancing of 248 million reducing the average margin of these facilities by 120 basis points we remain committed to refinancing debt at lower interest rates when such opportunities arise following the share repurchase program announced last november the company has purchased approximately 341 000 shares at an average price of 9 29 per share we have also committed financing for the procurement and installation of scrubbers of 140 million to be drawn during the rollout of our program in 2019 slide 4 shows a summary of our 2018 financial highlights adjusted ebitda for the full year of 2018 was at 260 9 million versus 128 million in 2017 adjusted net income for 2018 amounted to 86 1 million or 1 12 gain per share versus 4 3 million adjusted net loss or 0 07 loss per share in 2017 slide 5 graphically illustrates the changes in the company s cash balance during the fourth quarter the fleet generated free cash flow of 29 7 million after including debt proceeds and repayments from our refinancing activities capex payments for our acquisition and scrubber installments final payment of our deferred debt amounts and share repurchase program we arrived at a cash balance of 213 9 million at the end of the fourth quarter 2018 slide 6 highlights star bulk s strong liquidity position on the left hand side we present our fleetwide breakeven of 11 600 per vessel day which enables us to deleverage our balance sheet and create value for our shareholders even at relatively low average charter rates on the right hand side we provide a breakdown of the net debt position of star bulk which is currently close to 1 27 billion pro forma for the expected 60 of the refinancing of one ultramax vessel which is currently unlevered star bulk has no remaining equity capex for the three newcastlemax newbuilding vessels as there is committed financing in place for the remaining yard installments we expect to take delivery of these vessels during the first half of 2019 the graph on the bottom right hand side shows the positive trend in our adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income with five consecutive quarters of profitability please turn to slide 7 where we summarize our operational performance opex was at 3 938 per vessel per day for the quarter and 3 994 per vessel per day for 2018 as a whole net cash g a expenses were at 969 per vessel per day for the quarter and for 2018 g a expenses were at 1 004 per vessel per day a decrease of 8 year on year primarily attributed to synergies from the increase in the size of our fleet the combination of our in house management and the scale of the group enable us to provide our services at very competitive costs complemented by excellent ship management capabilities with star bulk consistently ranked among the top 3 managers evaluated by rightship slide 8 highlights that star bulk is one of the lowest cost operators among us listed dry bulk peers based on latest publicly available information star bulk s operating expenses are approximately 15 below the industry average in addition we are very focused on having the highest standards of vessel safety and maintenance to meet the requirements of our most demanding clients in slide 9 we are providing an update on our scrubber program which is proceeding as scheduled total expected capex as of february 2018 is at 130 5 million the graph below illustrates the estimated breakdown of the payments by quarter based on current forward fx rates and expected milestones it is important to note that we have secured approximately 140 million of debt financing for the program which we will be drawing down gradually within 2019 we are currently completing the installation of scrubbers on 15 of our larger vessels and are continuing with preparatory work in numerous vessels in order to reduce off hire time we expect to have the entire fleet scrubber fitted by end of 2019 and we estimate about 5 off hires across our fleet for 2019 for scrubber installations slide 10 illustrates star bulk s employment coverage for the first quarter of 2019 we have fixed employment for approximately 70 of the days in the first quarter of 2019 at average tce rates of 12 954 per vessel day i will now pass the floor to our ceo petros pappas for a market update and his closing remarks petros pappas chief executive officer thank you christos please turn to slide 11 for a brief update of supply during 2018 a total of 28 2 million deadweight were delivered and 4 4 million deadweight were sent to demolition both the lowest in a decade for a 23 7 million deadweight net inflow of vessels or 2 9 a total of 32 7 million deadweight were reported by clarksons as firm orders and up to an additional 8 million deadweight were identified as lois or options during the year the order book currently stands between 11 and 12 of the fleet depending on how many lois and options will be exercised it is worth noting that the geared order book stands at just 6 6 of the fleet the average steaming speed of the dry bulk fleet was approximately 11 6 knots for the year during 2019 and 2020 the fleet is projected to expand at a similar pace to that of 2018 however due to projected scrubber installations and tanks cleaning off hires during 2019 and slow steaming increased scrapping during 2020 effective supply is unlikely to expand by more than 1 5 per annum let s now turn to slide 12 for a brief update of demand according to clarksons the 2018 dry bulk trade is estimated to have grown by 2 4 in tons and 2 8 in ton miles this represents a downward revision to our last earnings call and is mainly caused by weaker iron ore and grain trade activity during the fourth quarter strong steel prices and profit margins during the first three quarters of 2018 supported a 6 4 increase in global steel production during 2018 this was led by china which registered growth of 9 8 during the year china s environmental restrictions have also led to a 4 year on year decline in domestic iron ore production despite a combination of strong steel production and lower domestic iron ore production china imports of iron ore experienced a decrease of 1 in 2018 as a result of increased use of scrap and destocking of iron ore stockpiles brazil iron ore exports expanded by only 1 7 during 2018 due to poor weather conditions political unrest and the anglo american pipe leakage incident in the first half of the year australian iron ore exports are estimated to have increased by 1 6 in 2018 with q4 estimated to have contracted by 2 6 year on year according to clarksons iron ore trade decreased by 0 1 in tons and 0 5 in ton miles during 2018 china coal imports increased by 3 6 during 2018 with q4 seeing a contraction of more than 20 due to import restrictions placed thermal coal imports during 2018 received support from a 7 4 increase in electricity generation weak hydropower generation and relatively flat domestic coal production at the same time indian coal imports are estimated to have increased by 17 7 during 2018 according to clarksons thermal and coking coal trade increased by 3 8 in tons and 5 in ton miles during 2018 the us china trade dispute and the imposition of 25 tariffs on us imports by china has taken its toll on soybean trade this year brazil soybean exports increased by 23 partly picking up the slack ahead of the us export season which has underperformed heavily during the last months chinese imports of soybeans ended down 7 8 year on year in 2018 according to clarksons grain trade including soybeans increased by 0 6 in tons and contracted by 0 6 in ton miles during 2018 during 2019 total dry bulk trade in ton miles is projected to expand at a slightly higher pace to that of 2018 mainly on the back of a rebound in grains trade unfortunately the brazilian mine accident in january 2019 implies further iron ore disruptions the extent of which are still too early to quantify furthermore the imo sulfur regulation is now less than 11 months away and we expect it will lead to a decrease in overall supply of vessels through slow steaming and accelerated scrapping affecting markets positively i will now pass the floor over to the operator to answer any questions you may have questions and answers operator thank you your first question comes from the line of amit mehrotra from deutsche bank please go ahead and ask your question your line is now open christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst this is chris snyder from deutsche bank so first question is around q1 bookings they came in a bit better than expectations given the recent weakness especially for the larger segments was this due to timing or vessel locations or are you guys seeing a firmer day rate environment than maybe what the ship brokers are quoting hamish norton president chris hi chris can you please repeat the question i didn t hear the beginning christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst so q1 bookings came in better than expectations given the recent weakness especially for the larger segments was this due to timing or just vessel locations or are you guys seeing a firmer day rate environment maybe than what the ship brokers are quoting petros pappas chief executive officer well firmer bookings you mean the fixtures that we have already done for q1 christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst yes petros pappas chief executive officer yes well as we do every year after august of every year until november we basically try to fix short term periods that go through q1 and part of q2 it s a strategy we follow every year because most of the time seasonally q1 and part of q2 are relatively slow so despite the fact that we were potentially expecting a cease of trade war we thought that fixing at levels of around 13 000 was a decent level and therefore we went ahead and fixed i mean had we not fixed today we re facing a levels of between 5 000 and 7 000 christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst okay thank you for that color and then next so a few ports have announced open loop scrubber bans in their territorial waters or inland waterways can you just talk about how this changes scrubber utilization i think it would be helpful if you could talk about just how this changes the number of scrubber operating days for capes and panamax vessels as we all try to think about returns petros pappas chief executive officer chris when we did our calculations on scrubbers we did not take into account port time at all we were only taking into account ship days and therefore it does not make a difference in the computation we have done that these bans don t make a difference at all in our calculation so actually it s going to potentially be even better because there s going to be many ports that have no ban on open loop scrubbers and there we will be able to use them and also please keep in mind that in ports the consumption is like 2 5 tons per vessel where at sea it can be anywhere between 25 tons and 50 tons and therefore this consumption is very very minor christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst okay thank you for that and then just a follow up on the scrubbers has there been any demand or outreach from charters looking to lock in scrubber fitted vessels on term contracts obviously you guys would be giving up some upside locking some of these ships away but it will also allow you to demonstrate the positive economics of the scrubber investment is there any any outreach on that front petros pappas chief executive officer there s been a number of charters that have approached us but our strategy is different we are intending to go toward voyage business meaning that we will source the cargos ourselves and therefore we will attempt to keep most of the benefit for ourselves christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst and could you provide any color on just kind of the premium if you were to lock a scrubber fitted vessel on to a time charter what kind of premium you would be looking at just relative to kind of the broader market petros pappas chief executive officer well we ve seen charters offer hamish norton president yes are you looking at the premium we expect or the premium that charters are currently offering christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst the premium that charters are currently offering i know it s obviously below what you guys expect but i would just be interested to see what they re offering petros pappas chief executive officer yes well it s charters are asking between 30 and 50 of the premium but they are offering all kinds of deals like they will offer to install the scrubber and make the profits themselves for up to five years without giving up any further premium other offers we ve seen is to install the scrubber and pay 1 000 or 2 000 more and then there s others that are saying ok you install the scrubber and you can get between 50 and 70 of the benefit and then there s others that say we will install the scrubber we will get the initial benefit until we repay the scrubber and then we can split 50 50 or 70 30 or whatever so there s all kinds they re all over the place christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst okay i appreciate all the color that does it for me thanks for the time guys petros pappas chief executive officer thank you chris operator thank you we will now take our next question please go ahead your line is now open randy giveans jefferies analyst hey guys randy giveans from jefferies how are you all hamish norton president fine randy giveans jefferies analyst excellent all right so you repurchased 3 1 million of sblk shares during 4q 18 still i think 47 million or so in remaining authorization so with the shares trading at a steep discount to nav about 10 below that average price that you repurchased shares in 4q are additional share repurchases the number 1 use of cash going forward other than the scrubber financing hamish norton president certainly other than the scrubber acquisition share repurchases are the only use of cash that we currently are contemplating other than of course normal repayment of debt petros pappas chief executive officer sure just to add to that in general we are conservative in that we want to make sure that we always have a high cash balance to make sure that we are able to survive any dry bulk market especially until we reach 2020 randy giveans jefferies analyst yes that s fair and now can you discuss some of the equity incentive program how that was decided on so specifically how was the 120 million to 300 million outperformance and the 4 million shares kind of determined based on our math it looks like the outperformance would be about 3 000 to 7 000 per day per vessel to get to those kind of aforementioned numbers so with that scrubbers could easily attain that kind of 3 000 to 7 000 day premium yet your press release stated the company takes the view that the current likelihood of vesting these rsus does not meet a quote unquote more likely than not standard so with all that what do you expect the outperformance to be for those scrubbers and then again if you can kind of touch on how you decided on those kind of outperformance metrics hamish norton president okay so randy that s a very complex question so first of all let me make it clear that the incentive program was not an initiative of management it was an initiative of the compensation committee and it was put together over a substantial period of time through discussions with management and because our compensation committee s aggregate iq is so high complexity was no obstacle to our compensation committee and the complexity of this plan blossomed without much limit so the answer is that it started out as a four year plan with higher limits and was reduced to a two year plan with the limits you see and the answer is we have great expectations for the performance of the scrubbers but in terms of meeting a more likely than not standard for the financial statements i think everybody agreed and in consultation with our auditors our auditors agreed that the outperformance called for by the plan did not meet the appropriate accounting standard and this is an accounting issue solely and i m sure you have seen other instances where the accounting didn t necessarily track everything that you might have expected of the business and that s basically why we included enough information so that you can make your own model based on your own assumptions we ll see what the outperformance is when we get to it randy giveans jefferies analyst excellent yes i was not doubting the iq of the compensation committee but for my low iq thank you for explaining that quick follow up on the scrubbers so what spread in dollars per ton are you using kind of to determine that payback period of one to two years maybe two and a half years and then secondly for the scrubber strategy is that driven more by economics or more by operational decisions for fuel compatibility or fuel availability issues that you maybe foresee hamish norton president okay so first of all there is a forward market in heavy fuel oil and marine gas oil there is about to be or maybe has just developed a forward market for 0 5 fuel so there are forward prices for these fuels that can be used to calculate payback periods depending on your assumption about fuel availability engine consumption and how much of that premium the shipowner will get versus how much of that premium the charter will get if any but i mean we pay a lot of attention to the forward market and then our thinking was largely driven by economics because frankly in a free market the likelihood of there being a significant shortage of either low sulfur or high sulfur fuel oil is not very high randy giveans jefferies analyst got it all right well i will petros pappas chief executive officer randy i d like to randy this is petros i d like to add the couple of things here first of all operationally continuing with heavy fuel oil will not present any issues for us and that s extremely important we don t need to clean our tanks we don t need to try new fuels we don t need to use blends which may be incompatible with each other so operationally it s going to be exactly the same way as it was for us also legally because there s going to be a number of claims on any charters that transcend the 1st of january 2020 what kind of bunkers do the charters deliver the diesel or fuel what prices it s going to be extremely difficult legally for us it doesn t change we do with heavy fuel oil the second thing i want to talk about was that when we say financially yes we would like to make a profit and actually personally i think that if the price differential let s say is between 250 and 300 we may be able to repay the scrubbers within a year or so but the main financial consideration we have had in taking this decision was that we are hedging our future imagine if in january 2020 the market is actually not good we think it s going to be good because we think there s going to be slow steaming scrapping and stuff like that however and off hires however imagine a case where the market remains exactly the same as it is today in dollars per ton terms in dollars per ton terms it would mean that the guys that don t have scrubbers will actually have a higher cost and if they were making let s say 13 000 a day on a kamsarmax they may go down to 5 000 or 6 000 exactly because they will be paying higher bunker costs and these come out of those dollars per ton where the people that have scrubbers may be likely enough to face even lower heavy fuel oil prices and that means that even under bad market circumstances we may be able to make more than 13 000 a day so a major driver and consideration for this decision of ours was to be able to hedge and not only survive but do very well in a potentially slow market if the market is strong which we think it will be then we ll just make a lot of money and we ll be all happy and maybe we ll get some promote but if it is slow then we are securing the future of our company randy giveans jefferies analyst i like it well thank you so much for the in depth color that s it for me operator thank you our next question is now open please go ahead hamish norton president does that mean there are no more questions operator there are currently two more questions in the queue your line is now open hamish norton president okay max yaras morgan stanley analyst hi this is max yaras from morgan stanley can you guys hear me hamish norton president yes max yaras morgan stanley analyst all right thank you you guys did a really good job of covering wrapping up 2018 i was wondering if you could give me an update on year to date trades whether maybe coal trade bounced back post year end or how you see vale the vale incident kind of already affecting flows petros pappas chief executive officer so the question is about what vale is going to be doing and what will happen with coal trade max yaras morgan stanley analyst yes exactly what you re seeing so far this year petros pappas chief executive officer i think we are seeing exactly what you are seeing i think we are seeing a couple of we re seeing a major catastrophe in a dam which also cost lives and we re seeing potential disruptions in other mines not because there was an accident but because they want to go through testing those the stability of those mines and obviously this has a negative effect effect on the market this we hope and we expect is going to be a short term effect on the market but but even if it isn t and even if brazil or narvik or in norway or sept iles in canada cannot actually cover for those lost tons and i m using these three places because the ton miles are longer and one has to and china has to import those cargos let s say from australia which is the closest place to china for iron ore that i did actually the calculation and i said ok let s say that we have 30 million tons that needs to be imported from closer places what will the effect on the market be so i did this calculation i said ok 30 million tons means 150 vessels and the differential in sailing is 50 days per trip so that s 7 500 days if you divide that by 360 days of a year it means 21 vessels 21 vessels less needed because 30 million tons of iron ore will not be exported by brazil but may be exported by australia this the effect of that on demand is 1 25 so we re talking about 1 25 the psychological effect of course it s higher and also the fact that this happened during the slowest quarter of the year and as it is seasonally and that it happened within one quarter it has a bigger effect so it could be also potentially positive for the next quarters like if brazil if vale manages to recover from this problem we could see more exports toward the second half of the year or for example if other countries compensated for those 30 million tons or whatever it s going to be because brazil s iron content in iron ore is higher than from other countries it could be it could mean that more tons are needed to be imported from other countries to compensate and therefore that might to an extent compensate for the loss of the ton miles now regarding coal we see that two things first of all we see some bad weather in australia which has reduced exports and of course on the other hand this bad weather keeps vessels in port but the effect the negative effect on export i think is probably higher and we see something else which is very interesting we see china delaying there s no ban right now but there s a delay in some ports of coking coal and a vessel may arrive at a port and delay for like 50 days to get the license to discharge and i was wondering this afternoon why this may be happening and i thought maybe if the china the us china war is over china will have to import stuff from the us and therefore it is possible that the chinese are delaying coke imports from australia in order to be able to compensate from the us in case there is some agreement coming forth in the next few weeks if that happens then we would see a much stronger market obviously because the ton miles are going to be much higher so these are my answers on the two questions you posed max yaras morgan stanley analyst yes it s very interesting i really appreciate the color i heard you answer i believe it was randy s question that your current scrubber fitting program and repurchases are may be top priorities or the only priorities but just given your confidence and returns in the program just wondering if you re thinking about maybe acquiring more vessels or spreading that program out to other vessels that you don t even own how can you capture those returns above and beyond your current fleet does that make sense hamish norton president well look we have no current plans to acquire any vessels for cash as we ve done in the past if we see fleets that are available for sale for cash and shares where we can use our shares so as to acquire these fleets without increasing our leverage at all and without decreasing our cash balance per vessel we would consider that but we haven t seen anything recently and i don t think the probability of that sort of thing occurring soon is very high max yaras morgan stanley analyst sure but what do you think about installing scrubbers maybe on other companies vessels and some kind of profit share any way to kind of capture that high return potential hamish norton president sure we re in the market to do deals with other companies where we can install a scrubber on the ship and profit from that again there are lots of deals that would make sense from our point of view i don t know how likely those are going to end up being petros pappas chief executive officer yes of course if you think that we re going to be installing 110 scrubbers on our vessels within the year which is a major task if we were to charter in more vessels we would need to install more so it will make it even more difficult plus the cash flow expense because i don t think we can get loans on chartered in vessels we can as we did with our own fleet hamish norton president yes and also petros and i would have to go to welding school and it would take some time max yaras morgan stanley analyst fair enough thank you guys operator thank you we will now take our next question please go ahead your line is now open noah parquette jp morgan analyst hi it s noah parquette at jp morgan i wanted to ask you guys saw that report last week i think from the european commission to the imo and talking about environmental effects with scrubbers and there s been some growing movement toward that i wanted to get your thoughts on potential implications maybe out of that meeting in may or if there s any change to kind of the life cycle of scrubbers in your view and just i think that s coming out more in conversations now as a risk so just would love to hear your thoughts hamish norton president sure so first of all the scientific evidence is being really ignored in a lot of the popular and even the industry debate and the scientific evidence is basically that if you use a scrubber the wash water largely meets in most cases it meets european union standards for drinking water in every case it meets european union standards for surface waters and if you burn compliant fuel without a scrubber you re putting these heavy metals and these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into the air which then fall into the water so i mean it s not as though you re not contributing to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals if you don t use a scrubber just the contrary you re putting them into the air first before they go into the water but obviously we re concerned about the public relations aspect of this and it s taken some time but the clean shipping alliance 2020 is finally getting up to speed we re members there are a large number of other shipping companies who are members and we ll be doing our utmost to get the facts across and make sure that they are heard that being said the current initiatives by certain ports to ban operation of open loop scrubbers in port as petros said is not a major economic hit we were not counting on being able to use the scrubbers in any port when we did our analysis but we obviously would start to be concerned if the initiatives went beyond that and that s hopefully what the clean shipping alliance 2020 will be addressing noah parquette jp morgan analyst okay great and then just one question obviously everybody is looking at the demand impacts from vale is there anything on the supply side that we re maybe missing in terms of valemax utilization or any other things that could be part of the fall off petros pappas chief executive officer on the supply side well on the supply side you mean vessels or iron ore from vale noah parquette jp morgan analyst yes i mean will some of the valemax s utilization be impacted by this i mean it s hard for them to find other they re very specialized right so just kind of love to hear your thoughts petros pappas chief executive officer there is a few tens of all the vessels that we believe will be impacted by the fact that there was a company that is being accused of tampering with the vessels condition and i think that this will actually turn into having to scrap like 40 to 50 of those vessels that are still in the season that are like 25 year to 30 year old and i mean loading 50 000 or 100 000 tons of iron ore actually loading 30 000 tons per hour on iron ore capes is very is very stressful on those vessels and if they re not in tip top condition you can have more accidents occurring like the one that happened a couple of years ago so we believe that these vessels will be retired from circulation within the next 24 months at the most i see already six vessels six capes having been scrapped in the first 40 days of this year if this continued it would mean 45 for a year it won t continue like that obviously but six vessels of older vintage have been scrapped so we think that this is very important one other thing that i want to say is that with the slow market that we re seeing today there are benefits because nobody is ordering and scrapping is more incentivized so there s nothing bad without some good as the ancient greeks used to say noah parquette jp morgan analyst okay great thank you operator thank you we ll now take our next question please go ahead your line is now open magnus fyhr seaport global analyst yes hi this is magnus fyhr seaport global i just had one question to clarify on the vale delivery schedule valemax delivery schedule you mentioned that it s likely that these older vloc conversions be phased out in the next 24 months well will that not just be replaced by the large number of valemaxes on order that s delivering over the next two years or has anything changed there or do you think these vloc conversions will be scrapped ahead of the deliveries petros pappas chief executive officer well of course there is this vlocs that are coming between now and 2022 and that is something that possibly will not change unless if some of the options that have been declared are not that have not been declared yet are never declared otherwise yes we expect that these vessels will come in operation during the next three years or so magnus fyhr seaport global analyst okay great thanks for clarifying that petros pappas chief executive officer thank you operator thank you operator instructions there have been no further questions entered at this time please continue petros pappas chief executive officer nothing more

both the wgc and lbma published outlooks for the global economy and gold market in 2019 who is right wgc s outlook for gold in 2019 let s start from the world gold council wgc which published its 2019 outlook on january 10th as befits the organization representing the industry s interests the wgc is bullish on gold prices no surprises here according to the institution the following trends will mainly shape the gold market in 2019 financial market instability monetary policy and the us dollar and structural economic reforms first the wgc expects higher levels of risk and uncertainty this year due to the elevated market volatility rising political and economic instability in europe think about brexit social unrest in france a populist government in italy or secessionism in spain and potentially higher inflation from protectionist policies all these factors are said to increase the likelihood of a global recession nudging investors toward gold as an effective portfolio diversifier and a safe haven second the wgc admits that although market risk will likely remain high higher interest rates and us dollar s strength could limit gold s upside however the organization believes that the greenback may be losing steam while the positive effect of higher federal funds rate on the dollar will diminish as the fed s monetary policy stance becomes neutral related tech giants lead renewable push third the wgc argues that pro growth economic reforms implemented in india and china would support consumer demand and thus gold prices this claim is the weakest and we refuted many times the argument that consumer demand drives the gold prices actually the opposite is true i e consumers are price takers not price setters however we could sign under the previous two points we also believe that the dollar s upside is limited while the pace of fed s tightening is slowing down and we do agree that the level of political and market risks is somewhat higher than last year although we would not overestimate europe s weakness despite its fragility it still grows lbma s global macroeconomic outlook for 2019 2020 let s move on now to the lbma s outlook actually the presented view was not formulated by the london bullion market association but by adam posen president of the peterson institute for international economics whose keynote speech from the lbma lppm conference in boston on 28 30th october 2018 was published in the recent issue of the alchemist we will analyze other articles in the next edition of the gold news monitor according to him there are four key trends to keep in mind for the coming two years a shift from financial risk to political risk the reinforcement of a long term negative productivity trend the increasing risk of inflation and economic and political turmoil in latin america first the author argues that the us turns isolationist and nationalist which lowers the political stability all around the world the uncertainty is higher while investment subdued we agree with that related silver demand set to grow significantly in 2019 second the current protectionism and anti investment politics will aggravate the problem of sluggish productivity growth it s important not only because it implies slower economic growth but also because the economy has less room to run hot there is not fast technological progress which could counterbalance the inflationary pressure hence and this is the third point we have an inflation risk which could materialize in the second half of the year forcing the fed to more aggressive actions so far inflation has been limited but the upward risk exists certainly fourth although the fed s tightening cycle will not put all emerging markets into trouble latin america is particularly at risk think about the economic disaster in venezuela immigration crisis in columbia or many questions marks regarding bolsonaro s brazil taking all these factors into account posen is bullish on gold arguing that overall political economic framework will be at the margin pushing up values for gold a more politically uncertain environment incentives people to hold their assets in non currency assets a more inflationary environment even one not hugely inflationary but one with more upside risk to inflation is something that incentivizes people to move into gold and other precious metals a more politically fragmented system where the risk of large currency swings is high further reinforcing this a low productivity growth environment is one that reduces the relative gains of taking speculative risk in other forms of investment which should also move you towards gold implications for gold ladies and gentlemen we have a draw both the wgc and lbma alchemist s article by posen present convincing arguments that fundamentals are moving in the direction of gold although we question some of the details we agree with the general outlook for the gold market in 2019 this year might be indeed better for the yellow metal than in 2018 we do not expect a global recession and a rally in gold prices but we do expect that 2019 will be more supportive for the gold prices at the margin by arkadiusz sieron via sunshine profits more top reads from safehaven com

officer of star bulk carriers and i would like to welcome you to the star bulk carriers conference call regarding our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 before we begin i kindly ask you to take a moment to read the safe harbor statement on slide number 2 of our presentation let us now turn to slide number 3 of the presentation for a summary of our fourth quarter 2018 financial highlights in the three months ending december 31 2018 tce revenues amounted to 137 8 million 53 1 higher than the 90 million for the same period in 2017 adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter 2018 was 82 4 million versus 55 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 amounted to 30 3 million or 0 33 gain per share versus 21 5 million or 0 34 gain per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 this is our fifth consecutive profitable quarter our time charter equivalent rate during this quarter was 14 140 per day compared to 13 860 per day in the same quarter last year during q4 2018 our average daily operating expenses were at 3 938 per vessel per day during this quarter we concluded the refinancing of 248 million reducing the average margin of these facilities by 120 basis points we remain committed to refinancing debt at lower interest rates when such opportunities arise following the share repurchase program announced last november the company has purchased approximately 341 000 shares at an average price of 9 29 per share we have also committed financing for the procurement and installation of scrubbers of 140 million to be drawn during the rollout of our program in 2019 slide 4 shows a summary of our 2018 financial highlights adjusted ebitda for the full year of 2018 was at 260 9 million versus 128 million in 2017 adjusted net income for 2018 amounted to 86 1 million or 1 12 gain per share versus 4 3 million adjusted net loss or 0 07 loss per share in 2017 slide 5 graphically illustrates the changes in the company s cash balance during the fourth quarter the fleet generated free cash flow of 29 7 million after including debt proceeds and repayments from our refinancing activities capex payments for our acquisition and scrubber installments final payment of our deferred debt amounts and share repurchase program we arrived at a cash balance of 213 9 million at the end of the fourth quarter 2018 slide 6 highlights star bulk s strong liquidity position on the left hand side we present our fleetwide breakeven of 11 600 per vessel day which enables us to deleverage our balance sheet and create value for our shareholders even at relatively low average charter rates on the right hand side we provide a breakdown of the net debt position of star bulk which is currently close to 1 27 billion pro forma for the expected 60 of the refinancing of one ultramax vessel which is currently unlevered star bulk has no remaining equity capex for the three newcastlemax newbuilding vessels as there is committed financing in place for the remaining yard installments we expect to take delivery of these vessels during the first half of 2019 the graph on the bottom right hand side shows the positive trend in our adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income with five consecutive quarters of profitability please turn to slide 7 where we summarize our operational performance opex was at 3 938 per vessel per day for the quarter and 3 994 per vessel per day for 2018 as a whole net cash g a expenses were at 969 per vessel per day for the quarter and for 2018 g a expenses were at 1 004 per vessel per day a decrease of 8 year on year primarily attributed to synergies from the increase in the size of our fleet the combination of our in house management and the scale of the group enable us to provide our services at very competitive costs complemented by excellent ship management capabilities with star bulk consistently ranked among the top 3 managers evaluated by rightship slide 8 highlights that star bulk is one of the lowest cost operators among us listed dry bulk peers based on latest publicly available information star bulk s operating expenses are approximately 15 below the industry average in addition we are very focused on having the highest standards of vessel safety and maintenance to meet the requirements of our most demanding clients in slide 9 we are providing an update on our scrubber program which is proceeding as scheduled total expected capex as of february 2018 is at 130 5 million the graph below illustrates the estimated breakdown of the payments by quarter based on current forward fx rates and expected milestones it is important to note that we have secured approximately 140 million of debt financing for the program which we will be drawing down gradually within 2019 we are currently completing the installation of scrubbers on 15 of our larger vessels and are continuing with preparatory work in numerous vessels in order to reduce off hire time we expect to have the entire fleet scrubber fitted by end of 2019 and we estimate about 5 off hires across our fleet for 2019 for scrubber installations slide 10 illustrates star bulk s employment coverage for the first quarter of 2019 we have fixed employment for approximately 70 of the days in the first quarter of 2019 at average tce rates of 12 954 per vessel day i will now pass the floor to our ceo petros pappas for a market update and his closing remarks petros pappas chief executive officer thank you christos please turn to slide 11 for a brief update of supply during 2018 a total of 28 2 million deadweight were delivered and 4 4 million deadweight were sent to demolition both the lowest in a decade for a 23 7 million deadweight net inflow of vessels or 2 9 a total of 32 7 million deadweight were reported by clarksons as firm orders and up to an additional 8 million deadweight were identified as lois or options during the year the order book currently stands between 11 and 12 of the fleet depending on how many lois and options will be exercised it is worth noting that the geared order book stands at just 6 6 of the fleet the average steaming speed of the dry bulk fleet was approximately 11 6 knots for the year during 2019 and 2020 the fleet is projected to expand at a similar pace to that of 2018 however due to projected scrubber installations and tanks cleaning off hires during 2019 and slow steaming increased scrapping during 2020 effective supply is unlikely to expand by more than 1 5 per annum let s now turn to slide 12 for a brief update of demand according to clarksons the 2018 dry bulk trade is estimated to have grown by 2 4 in tons and 2 8 in ton miles this represents a downward revision to our last earnings call and is mainly caused by weaker iron ore and grain trade activity during the fourth quarter strong steel prices and profit margins during the first three quarters of 2018 supported a 6 4 increase in global steel production during 2018 this was led by china which registered growth of 9 8 during the year china s environmental restrictions have also led to a 4 year on year decline in domestic iron ore production despite a combination of strong steel production and lower domestic iron ore production china imports of iron ore experienced a decrease of 1 in 2018 as a result of increased use of scrap and destocking of iron ore stockpiles brazil iron ore exports expanded by only 1 7 during 2018 due to poor weather conditions political unrest and the anglo american pipe leakage incident in the first half of the year australian iron ore exports are estimated to have increased by 1 6 in 2018 with q4 estimated to have contracted by 2 6 year on year according to clarksons iron ore trade decreased by 0 1 in tons and 0 5 in ton miles during 2018 china coal imports increased by 3 6 during 2018 with q4 seeing a contraction of more than 20 due to import restrictions placed thermal coal imports during 2018 received support from a 7 4 increase in electricity generation weak hydropower generation and relatively flat domestic coal production at the same time indian coal imports are estimated to have increased by 17 7 during 2018 according to clarksons thermal and coking coal trade increased by 3 8 in tons and 5 in ton miles during 2018 the us china trade dispute and the imposition of 25 tariffs on us imports by china has taken its toll on soybean trade this year brazil soybean exports increased by 23 partly picking up the slack ahead of the us export season which has underperformed heavily during the last months chinese imports of soybeans ended down 7 8 year on year in 2018 according to clarksons grain trade including soybeans increased by 0 6 in tons and contracted by 0 6 in ton miles during 2018 during 2019 total dry bulk trade in ton miles is projected to expand at a slightly higher pace to that of 2018 mainly on the back of a rebound in grains trade unfortunately the brazilian mine accident in january 2019 implies further iron ore disruptions the extent of which are still too early to quantify furthermore the imo sulfur regulation is now less than 11 months away and we expect it will lead to a decrease in overall supply of vessels through slow steaming and accelerated scrapping affecting markets positively i will now pass the floor over to the operator to answer any questions you may have questions and answers operator thank you your first question comes from the line of amit mehrotra from deutsche bank please go ahead and ask your question your line is now open christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst this is chris snyder from deutsche bank so first question is around q1 bookings they came in a bit better than expectations given the recent weakness especially for the larger segments was this due to timing or vessel locations or are you guys seeing a firmer day rate environment than maybe what the ship brokers are quoting hamish norton president chris hi chris can you please repeat the question i didn t hear the beginning christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst so q1 bookings came in better than expectations given the recent weakness especially for the larger segments was this due to timing or just vessel locations or are you guys seeing a firmer day rate environment maybe than what the ship brokers are quoting petros pappas chief executive officer well firmer bookings you mean the fixtures that we have already done for q1 christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst yes petros pappas chief executive officer yes well as we do every year after august of every year until november we basically try to fix short term periods that go through q1 and part of q2 it s a strategy we follow every year because most of the time seasonally q1 and part of q2 are relatively slow so despite the fact that we were potentially expecting a cease of trade war we thought that fixing at levels of around 13 000 was a decent level and therefore we went ahead and fixed i mean had we not fixed today we re facing a levels of between 5 000 and 7 000 christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst okay thank you for that color and then next so a few ports have announced open loop scrubber bans in their territorial waters or inland waterways can you just talk about how this changes scrubber utilization i think it would be helpful if you could talk about just how this changes the number of scrubber operating days for capes and panamax vessels as we all try to think about returns petros pappas chief executive officer chris when we did our calculations on scrubbers we did not take into account port time at all we were only taking into account ship days and therefore it does not make a difference in the computation we have done that these bans don t make a difference at all in our calculation so actually it s going to potentially be even better because there s going to be many ports that have no ban on open loop scrubbers and there we will be able to use them and also please keep in mind that in ports the consumption is like 2 5 tons per vessel where at sea it can be anywhere between 25 tons and 50 tons and therefore this consumption is very very minor christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst okay thank you for that and then just a follow up on the scrubbers has there been any demand or outreach from charters looking to lock in scrubber fitted vessels on term contracts obviously you guys would be giving up some upside locking some of these ships away but it will also allow you to demonstrate the positive economics of the scrubber investment is there any any outreach on that front petros pappas chief executive officer there s been a number of charters that have approached us but our strategy is different we are intending to go toward voyage business meaning that we will source the cargos ourselves and therefore we will attempt to keep most of the benefit for ourselves christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst and could you provide any color on just kind of the premium if you were to lock a scrubber fitted vessel on to a time charter what kind of premium you would be looking at just relative to kind of the broader market petros pappas chief executive officer well we ve seen charters offer hamish norton president yes are you looking at the premium we expect or the premium that charters are currently offering christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst the premium that charters are currently offering i know it s obviously below what you guys expect but i would just be interested to see what they re offering petros pappas chief executive officer yes well it s charters are asking between 30 and 50 of the premium but they are offering all kinds of deals like they will offer to install the scrubber and make the profits themselves for up to five years without giving up any further premium other offers we ve seen is to install the scrubber and pay 1 000 or 2 000 more and then there s others that are saying ok you install the scrubber and you can get between 50 and 70 of the benefit and then there s others that say we will install the scrubber we will get the initial benefit until we repay the scrubber and then we can split 50 50 or 70 30 or whatever so there s all kinds they re all over the place christopher snyder deutsche bank analyst okay i appreciate all the color that does it for me thanks for the time guys petros pappas chief executive officer thank you chris operator thank you we will now take our next question please go ahead your line is now open randy giveans jefferies analyst hey guys randy giveans from jefferies how are you all hamish norton president fine randy giveans jefferies analyst excellent all right so you repurchased 3 1 million of sblk shares during 4q 18 still i think 47 million or so in remaining authorization so with the shares trading at a steep discount to nav about 10 below that average price that you repurchased shares in 4q are additional share repurchases the number 1 use of cash going forward other than the scrubber financing hamish norton president certainly other than the scrubber acquisition share repurchases are the only use of cash that we currently are contemplating other than of course normal repayment of debt petros pappas chief executive officer sure just to add to that in general we are conservative in that we want to make sure that we always have a high cash balance to make sure that we are able to survive any dry bulk market especially until we reach 2020 randy giveans jefferies analyst yes that s fair and now can you discuss some of the equity incentive program how that was decided on so specifically how was the 120 million to 300 million outperformance and the 4 million shares kind of determined based on our math it looks like the outperformance would be about 3 000 to 7 000 per day per vessel to get to those kind of aforementioned numbers so with that scrubbers could easily attain that kind of 3 000 to 7 000 day premium yet your press release stated the company takes the view that the current likelihood of vesting these rsus does not meet a quote unquote more likely than not standard so with all that what do you expect the outperformance to be for those scrubbers and then again if you can kind of touch on how you decided on those kind of outperformance metrics hamish norton president okay so randy that s a very complex question so first of all let me make it clear that the incentive program was not an initiative of management it was an initiative of the compensation committee and it was put together over a substantial period of time through discussions with management and because our compensation committee s aggregate iq is so high complexity was no obstacle to our compensation committee and the complexity of this plan blossomed without much limit so the answer is that it started out as a four year plan with higher limits and was reduced to a two year plan with the limits you see and the answer is we have great expectations for the performance of the scrubbers but in terms of meeting a more likely than not standard for the financial statements i think everybody agreed and in consultation with our auditors our auditors agreed that the outperformance called for by the plan did not meet the appropriate accounting standard and this is an accounting issue solely and i m sure you have seen other instances where the accounting didn t necessarily track everything that you might have expected of the business and that s basically why we included enough information so that you can make your own model based on your own assumptions we ll see what the outperformance is when we get to it randy giveans jefferies analyst excellent yes i was not doubting the iq of the compensation committee but for my low iq thank you for explaining that quick follow up on the scrubbers so what spread in dollars per ton are you using kind of to determine that payback period of one to two years maybe two and a half years and then secondly for the scrubber strategy is that driven more by economics or more by operational decisions for fuel compatibility or fuel availability issues that you maybe foresee hamish norton president okay so first of all there is a forward market in heavy fuel oil and marine gas oil there is about to be or maybe has just developed a forward market for 0 5 fuel so there are forward prices for these fuels that can be used to calculate payback periods depending on your assumption about fuel availability engine consumption and how much of that premium the shipowner will get versus how much of that premium the charter will get if any but i mean we pay a lot of attention to the forward market and then our thinking was largely driven by economics because frankly in a free market the likelihood of there being a significant shortage of either low sulfur or high sulfur fuel oil is not very high randy giveans jefferies analyst got it all right well i will petros pappas chief executive officer randy i d like to randy this is petros i d like to add the couple of things here first of all operationally continuing with heavy fuel oil will not present any issues for us and that s extremely important we don t need to clean our tanks we don t need to try new fuels we don t need to use blends which may be incompatible with each other so operationally it s going to be exactly the same way as it was for us also legally because there s going to be a number of claims on any charters that transcend the 1st of january 2020 what kind of bunkers do the charters deliver the diesel or fuel what prices it s going to be extremely difficult legally for us it doesn t change we do with heavy fuel oil the second thing i want to talk about was that when we say financially yes we would like to make a profit and actually personally i think that if the price differential let s say is between 250 and 300 we may be able to repay the scrubbers within a year or so but the main financial consideration we have had in taking this decision was that we are hedging our future imagine if in january 2020 the market is actually not good we think it s going to be good because we think there s going to be slow steaming scrapping and stuff like that however and off hires however imagine a case where the market remains exactly the same as it is today in dollars per ton terms in dollars per ton terms it would mean that the guys that don t have scrubbers will actually have a higher cost and if they were making let s say 13 000 a day on a kamsarmax they may go down to 5 000 or 6 000 exactly because they will be paying higher bunker costs and these come out of those dollars per ton where the people that have scrubbers may be likely enough to face even lower heavy fuel oil prices and that means that even under bad market circumstances we may be able to make more than 13 000 a day so a major driver and consideration for this decision of ours was to be able to hedge and not only survive but do very well in a potentially slow market if the market is strong which we think it will be then we ll just make a lot of money and we ll be all happy and maybe we ll get some promote but if it is slow then we are securing the future of our company randy giveans jefferies analyst i like it well thank you so much for the in depth color that s it for me operator thank you our next question is now open please go ahead hamish norton president does that mean there are no more questions operator there are currently two more questions in the queue your line is now open hamish norton president okay max yaras morgan stanley analyst hi this is max yaras from morgan stanley can you guys hear me hamish norton president yes max yaras morgan stanley analyst all right thank you you guys did a really good job of covering wrapping up 2018 i was wondering if you could give me an update on year to date trades whether maybe coal trade bounced back post year end or how you see vale the vale incident kind of already affecting flows petros pappas chief executive officer so the question is about what vale is going to be doing and what will happen with coal trade max yaras morgan stanley analyst yes exactly what you re seeing so far this year petros pappas chief executive officer i think we are seeing exactly what you are seeing i think we are seeing a couple of we re seeing a major catastrophe in a dam which also cost lives and we re seeing potential disruptions in other mines not because there was an accident but because they want to go through testing those the stability of those mines and obviously this has a negative effect effect on the market this we hope and we expect is going to be a short term effect on the market but but even if it isn t and even if brazil or narvik or in norway or sept iles in canada cannot actually cover for those lost tons and i m using these three places because the ton miles are longer and one has to and china has to import those cargos let s say from australia which is the closest place to china for iron ore that i did actually the calculation and i said ok let s say that we have 30 million tons that needs to be imported from closer places what will the effect on the market be so i did this calculation i said ok 30 million tons means 150 vessels and the differential in sailing is 50 days per trip so that s 7 500 days if you divide that by 360 days of a year it means 21 vessels 21 vessels less needed because 30 million tons of iron ore will not be exported by brazil but may be exported by australia this the effect of that on demand is 1 25 so we re talking about 1 25 the psychological effect of course it s higher and also the fact that this happened during the slowest quarter of the year and as it is seasonally and that it happened within one quarter it has a bigger effect so it could be also potentially positive for the next quarters like if brazil if vale manages to recover from this problem we could see more exports toward the second half of the year or for example if other countries compensated for those 30 million tons or whatever it s going to be because brazil s iron content in iron ore is higher than from other countries it could be it could mean that more tons are needed to be imported from other countries to compensate and therefore that might to an extent compensate for the loss of the ton miles now regarding coal we see that two things first of all we see some bad weather in australia which has reduced exports and of course on the other hand this bad weather keeps vessels in port but the effect the negative effect on export i think is probably higher and we see something else which is very interesting we see china delaying there s no ban right now but there s a delay in some ports of coking coal and a vessel may arrive at a port and delay for like 50 days to get the license to discharge and i was wondering this afternoon why this may be happening and i thought maybe if the china the us china war is over china will have to import stuff from the us and therefore it is possible that the chinese are delaying coke imports from australia in order to be able to compensate from the us in case there is some agreement coming forth in the next few weeks if that happens then we would see a much stronger market obviously because the ton miles are going to be much higher so these are my answers on the two questions you posed max yaras morgan stanley analyst yes it s very interesting i really appreciate the color i heard you answer i believe it was randy s question that your current scrubber fitting program and repurchases are may be top priorities or the only priorities but just given your confidence and returns in the program just wondering if you re thinking about maybe acquiring more vessels or spreading that program out to other vessels that you don t even own how can you capture those returns above and beyond your current fleet does that make sense hamish norton president well look we have no current plans to acquire any vessels for cash as we ve done in the past if we see fleets that are available for sale for cash and shares where we can use our shares so as to acquire these fleets without increasing our leverage at all and without decreasing our cash balance per vessel we would consider that but we haven t seen anything recently and i don t think the probability of that sort of thing occurring soon is very high max yaras morgan stanley analyst sure but what do you think about installing scrubbers maybe on other companies vessels and some kind of profit share any way to kind of capture that high return potential hamish norton president sure we re in the market to do deals with other companies where we can install a scrubber on the ship and profit from that again there are lots of deals that would make sense from our point of view i don t know how likely those are going to end up being petros pappas chief executive officer yes of course if you think that we re going to be installing 110 scrubbers on our vessels within the year which is a major task if we were to charter in more vessels we would need to install more so it will make it even more difficult plus the cash flow expense because i don t think we can get loans on chartered in vessels we can as we did with our own fleet hamish norton president yes and also petros and i would have to go to welding school and it would take some time max yaras morgan stanley analyst fair enough thank you guys operator thank you we will now take our next question please go ahead your line is now open noah parquette jp morgan analyst hi it s noah parquette at jp morgan i wanted to ask you guys saw that report last week i think from the european commission to the imo and talking about environmental effects with scrubbers and there s been some growing movement toward that i wanted to get your thoughts on potential implications maybe out of that meeting in may or if there s any change to kind of the life cycle of scrubbers in your view and just i think that s coming out more in conversations now as a risk so just would love to hear your thoughts hamish norton president sure so first of all the scientific evidence is being really ignored in a lot of the popular and even the industry debate and the scientific evidence is basically that if you use a scrubber the wash water largely meets in most cases it meets european union standards for drinking water in every case it meets european union standards for surface waters and if you burn compliant fuel without a scrubber you re putting these heavy metals and these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into the air which then fall into the water so i mean it s not as though you re not contributing to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals if you don t use a scrubber just the contrary you re putting them into the air first before they go into the water but obviously we re concerned about the public relations aspect of this and it s taken some time but the clean shipping alliance 2020 is finally getting up to speed we re members there are a large number of other shipping companies who are members and we ll be doing our utmost to get the facts across and make sure that they are heard that being said the current initiatives by certain ports to ban operation of open loop scrubbers in port as petros said is not a major economic hit we were not counting on being able to use the scrubbers in any port when we did our analysis but we obviously would start to be concerned if the initiatives went beyond that and that s hopefully what the clean shipping alliance 2020 will be addressing noah parquette jp morgan analyst okay great and then just one question obviously everybody is looking at the demand impacts from vale is there anything on the supply side that we re maybe missing in terms of valemax utilization or any other things that could be part of the fall off petros pappas chief executive officer on the supply side well on the supply side you mean vessels or iron ore from vale noah parquette jp morgan analyst yes i mean will some of the valemax s utilization be impacted by this i mean it s hard for them to find other they re very specialized right so just kind of love to hear your thoughts petros pappas chief executive officer there is a few tens of all the vessels that we believe will be impacted by the fact that there was a company that is being accused of tampering with the vessels condition and i think that this will actually turn into having to scrap like 40 to 50 of those vessels that are still in the season that are like 25 year to 30 year old and i mean loading 50 000 or 100 000 tons of iron ore actually loading 30 000 tons per hour on iron ore capes is very is very stressful on those vessels and if they re not in tip top condition you can have more accidents occurring like the one that happened a couple of years ago so we believe that these vessels will be retired from circulation within the next 24 months at the most i see already six vessels six capes having been scrapped in the first 40 days of this year if this continued it would mean 45 for a year it won t continue like that obviously but six vessels of older vintage have been scrapped so we think that this is very important one other thing that i want to say is that with the slow market that we re seeing today there are benefits because nobody is ordering and scrapping is more incentivized so there s nothing bad without some good as the ancient greeks used to say noah parquette jp morgan analyst okay great thank you operator thank you we ll now take our next question please go ahead your line is now open magnus fyhr seaport global analyst yes hi this is magnus fyhr seaport global i just had one question to clarify on the vale delivery schedule valemax delivery schedule you mentioned that it s likely that these older vloc conversions be phased out in the next 24 months well will that not just be replaced by the large number of valemaxes on order that s delivering over the next two years or has anything changed there or do you think these vloc conversions will be scrapped ahead of the deliveries petros pappas chief executive officer well of course there is this vlocs that are coming between now and 2022 and that is something that possibly will not change unless if some of the options that have been declared are not that have not been declared yet are never declared otherwise yes we expect that these vessels will come in operation during the next three years or so magnus fyhr seaport global analyst okay great thanks for clarifying that petros pappas chief executive officer thank you operator thank you operator instructions there have been no further questions entered at this time please continue petros pappas chief executive officer nothing more

in september 2018 we argued that china s economic and foreign policies were defying the laws of economics and geopolitics and warned that the situation could not last since then our assessment has been borne out and our concerns have deepened until recently china had been able to pursue a unique development path owing to the government s far reaching control over the economy and society more generally but those days are over the country s internal debts are mounting to unsustainable heights and domestic investment levels have passed the point of diminishing returns and are veering toward negative territory illustration by binay saha moreover china s strategy of fostering exports promoting industrial national champions and expropriating foreign technology has crossed the threshold of what the west especially the united states is willing to tolerate chinese president xi jinping s belt and road initiative is showing all the signs of imperial overreach not only does the bri s lending far exceed participating governments borrowing capacity but its loan terms have become increasingly onerous indeed usurious as harvard university s ricardo hausmann recently observed back in september we saw some discontinuity in china s economic performance as inevitable even if the country was not heading for a full blown crisis we believed it would almost certainly experience some combination of rapidly decelerating growth and a sharply depreciating exchange rate also read why china s 5g riches are outside the reach of international investors that prognosis has since become even more likely with global economic growth and exports declining china s economy is on track to slow further relative to the 6 4 per cent growth recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 the double digit average achieved from the 1980s until recently has never seemed more distant in response to the current global slowdown the chinese government has decided to loosen restrictions on private and public borrowing but this will merely aggravate the country s debt and overinvestment problems or as a famous chinese saying goes it is akin to drinking poison to quench one s thirst even without these macro developments china s defiance of well established findings in development economics was never going to last forever the economists douglass north daron acemoglu and james a robinson have shown that long run economic development tends to rely on strong state institutions and open political systems because these are necessary to foster competition investor confidence dynamism and innovation in the chart above the upward sloping line represents the positive relationship between political and economic development as the notable exception to an otherwise robust relationship china has long posed a problem for this theory with its closed political system it should not be anywhere near as rich as it is in the 1990s and 2000s the west made a gamble that china would cease to be an exception and would veer toward normalcy by adopting more open and democratic political institutions as indicated by the dotted blue arrow as a practical matter that bet translated into western policies to facilitate china s rise and decisions by us firms to transfer manufacturing capacity there but under xi s leadership china has instead become less open as shown by the red arrow and as nicholas lardy of the peterson institute for international economics shows in a new book its economy has also shifted back from a private sector driven growth model to state capitalism in other words systemic political and economic changes are making china even more of an exception thereby increasing the odds that its return to normalcy will come in the form of a sharp deterioration in economic performance the downward dotted black arrow there is no telling precisely when that correction will happen but the more china defies the rules of economic development the more likely it becomes also read china s obor initiative a global security challenge european experts unfortunately any discontinuity in china s economic performance would have a seismic effect on the rest of the world because it would lead to a significant weakening of the renminbi in fact china itself might engineer a depreciation of its currency in order to promote its exports and cushion the inevitable fall in domestic demand particularly its investment component such a scenario would have a tsunami like impact on global currencies other major asian countries would respond by pursuing their own devaluations to maintain their competitiveness and europe and the united states would experience sharp deflation as their currencies strengthened in kind for a historical comparison consider that in the 1930s the us dollar and british sterling depreciated by about 40 per cent over four years while the french and german currencies remained broadly stable measured against gold like the us and britain in 1929 just before the great depression today the major asian economies that would be affected by a chinese currency shock account for around 30 per cent of world trade making matters worse trade is much more important to the global economy today than it was 90 years ago in 2017 merchandise exports accounted for 20 25 per cent of global gdp compared to just 8 per cent in 1929 that means a depreciation in asian currencies would have a significantly greater global impact than the dollar sterling devaluation of the 1930s thus a china shock could potentially dwarf the competitive currency depreciations of the early 1930s one of the darkest economic periods in recorded history one way or another china s continued defiance of the laws of macroeconomics geopolitics and economic development will hasten its inevitable return to normalcy when that happens the world had better brace itself subramanian a former chief economic adviser to the government of india is a senior fellow at the peterson institute

islamabad moody s inves tor service has changed the outlook for pakistan s banking sector to negative from stable owing to the its over exposure towards government lending amid higher fiscal deficit over the next 12 18 months banks in pakistan will see their credit profiles challenged by their high exposure to the country s low rated sovereign debt and a slowing economy said constantinos kypreos senior vice president of the new york based rating agency in a statement released on monday the investor service said banks large holdings of government bonds link their credit profiles to the low rated government while slower economic growth will contain business opportunities for banks and stall improving trend in problem loans as a consequence the agency changed its outlook for the banking system in pakistan b3 negative to negative from stable said a statement adding the pakistani banks operating conditions will be difficult with the country s real gross domestic product gdp growth slowing to 4 3 per cent in the fiscal year ending june 2019 down from 5 8pc in 2018 stable deposit base provides some strength the pakistani rupee has depreciated 30pc versus the us dollar interest rates rose by 450 basis points between december 2017 and february 2019 and inflation is rising all factors which affect business and consumer confidence and the private sector s debt repayment capacities it added it also pointed out that pakistan s banks face the risk of macroeconomic contagion through a range of channels these included their large holdings of government securities which cap their credit profiles to the sovereign and from the authorities weakening capacity to support the banks in case of need as evidenced by the negative outlook on the sovereign rating on a more positive note the banks will continue to benefit from stable customer deposits and high liquidity added kypreos the negative outlook is based on moody s assessment of six drivers operating environment deteriorating asset risk deteriorating capital stable profitability and efficiency stable funding and liquidity stable and government support deteriorating moody s rates the five largest banks in pakistan by assets together these banks account for around 50pc of system deposits the statement said the rating agency said the declining trend in problem loans 8pc of gross loans as of september 2018 will stall as challenging operating conditions and structural impediments hinder banks ability to resolve legacy non performing loans moreover stable customer deposits and high liquidity will remain key strengths and customer deposits constitute approximately 71pc of total assets that will grow 10pc in 2019 providing ample low cost funding to banks the agency said cash and bank placements constitute about 15pc of total assets while another 34pc is invested in government securities offering sound liquidity expanding the low cost deposit base remains a key area of focus for banks low cost current accounts accounted for about 40pc of customer deposits as of september 2018 encouraging higher savings and enhancing the deposit base to 55pc of gdp from around 35pc currently is also a key goal for the authorities the report adds pakistani banks reliance on market funding has increased in recent years terming it a negative development this was primarily in the form of interbank and the central bank s repo facilities used for carry trades ie buying government bonds funded by short term borrowings since the spreads on such transactions have narrowed banks exposure to market funding has declined it said published in dawn february 12th 2019
key findings a higher minimum wage would boost ohio a 15 minimum wage in 2023 would restore the value of real minimum wage ohio s wage floor is worth 28 percent less than it would be if that level had been preserved raising the minimum to 15 by 2023 would lift wages for 2 million ohio workers 37 percent of the wage earning workforce nearly 1 6 million directly affected workers would receive an average increase of 2 73 in their hourly wage in 2018 dollars an increase of 26 percent another 450 000 workers would benefit from a spillover effect as employers raise wages of workers making more than 15 in order to attract and retain workers ohio minimum wage workers would take home about 8 7 billion in additional income and inject new spending into the state s economy the workers who would receive an increase are overwhelmingly adults most of whom work full time in regular jobs often to support a family raising the wage would slow or reverse growth in the racial wage gap and make pay more equal for men and women extending the minimum wage to tipped workers is necessary to improve both pay equity and job quality for women coupled with a raise to 15 preserving the state s inflation index would ensure that the passage of a living wage in ohio is a lasting solution executive summary ohio s minimum wage is too low to cover the basics a full time worker with a family of three earning the minimum wage falls 3 000 short of the poverty level a 15 minimum wage phased in over four steps by 2023 would benefit 2 million ohio workers it would improve equity and drive economic growth by generating around 8 7 billion in new wages for directly impacted workers a bill sponsored by representatives brigid kelly and several co sponsors is currently under review by the legislative services commission ohio voters recognize the need for stronger wages in 2006 they increased the state minimum wage above the federal level voters set ohio s minimum wage at 6 85 and indexed it to inflation so it would not erode in value each year the minimum wage has increased by 1 70 since then not adjusting for inflation bringing it to 8 55 today 1 30 more than the federal floor this 8 55 level is worth the same in 2019 as 6 85 was worth in 2006 however ohio s current minimum wage is worth less than the value of federal wage between 1961 and 1972 and at a few other points since then even though the state and nation are wealthier than ever ohio should increase its minimum wage to improve workers lives and enable them to take home their share of the growth in the economy a 15 minimum wage by 2023 would lift wages for 2 million ohio workers 37 percent of the wage earning workforce nearly 1 6 million directly affected workers 26 percent of the workforce would receive an average increase of 2 73 per hour in 2018 dollars the average directly affected worker puts in 30 6 hours per week and would see an earnings boost of 4 252 another 450 000 workers would benefit from a spillover effect as employers raise wages of those making more than 15 in order to attract and retain their workforces policy recommendations raise the minimum wage to 15 per hour by 2023 set the minimum wage at 12 per hour in 2020 then increase in three equal 1 steps to 15 eliminate the sub minimum wage for tipped workers retain the index to inflation so the wage will not lose value over time introduction this january ohio s minimum wage increased 25 cents to 8 55 per hour the change keeps the wage floor in step with prices it s a vital safeguard 67 300 ohioans saw a nominal raise in their take home pay yet despite the adjustment ohio s minimum wage remains too low to keep ohio workers and families afloat had it kept pace with inflation from its highest point the minimum wage covering ohioans would be 11 83 today but ohio has grown since then while low and moderate earning workers were left behind the state should take steps to raise the minimum wage to 15 per hour ohio representatives brigid kelly casey weinstein adam miller joe miller michele lepore hagan allison russo janine boyd jessica miranda kent smith bernadine kennedy kent catherine ingram bride rose sweeney and kristin boggs are introducing a 15 minimum wage to be carefully phased in by 2023 and indexed to the rate of inflation thereafter this report examines the impact of the bill on ohio workers and their families the raise would benefit some 2 million ohio workers make pay more equitable reduce use of safety net programs and ensure that all ohioans who work full time earn enough to cover the basics background voters increased ohio s minimum wage above the federal standard by ballot initiative in 2006 before that ohio workers were subject to the same minimum as all u s workers in 1968 the federal minimum wage was set to its highest level to date worth 11 83 in today s dollars a half century later pay standards for the state and the nation have fallen to two thirds of that level like 17 other states ohio indexes its minimum wage to inflation so that the wage level adjusts each year along with prices that index provides a safeguard against eroding purchasing power for the state s lowest paid workers unfortunately inflation had already eaten away a quarter of the value of the nation s highest minimum wage by the time ohio stepped in to pass its own wage and when it did it failed to restore all the lost ground even with ohio s slightly better state minimum ohio s minimum wage workers earn 28 percent less than their counterparts two generations ago restoring the wage to its peak value set at a time when the state and nation were far less wealthy should be uncontroversial to share in the gains the state has achieved since then ohio workers need a higher minimum wage than their grandparents had this report finds that a 15 minimum wage phased in by 2023 would help a total of 2 million ohioans it would directly benefit 1 6 million ohio workers now earning less than the new wage floor the typical affected worker now earns 11 46 and would see a pay raise of 2 73 in today s dollars a raise of 26 percent another 450 000 workers earning slightly more would also get a raise as employers adjust pay scales to attract and retain highly skilled workers raising the wage would restore balance for three decades in the wake of the new deal wages grew in tandem with the nation s economy policies implemented after the great depression supported union organizing social security safety nets and a more robust minimum wage these policies helped u s wages keep up with productivity to restore ohio to that path and ensure that all the state s workers share in the wealth they help create ohio should pass a higher minimum wage today ohio is 88 percent wealthier than it was in 1968 when the minimum wage reached its peak but the minimum wage and ohio s median wage have not grown with it instead typical wages have stagnated while wages for low wage workers have fallen by more than a quarter a 15 minimum wage effective in 2023 would be a step toward reversing the divergence in wealth of the last few decades it s an increase the state can well afford who benefits workers left behind ohio s 2019 minimum wage falls 3 500 short of the poverty level for a family of three for a full time year round worker many of the state s largest and fastest growing jobs leave a worker in or near poverty among ohio s 10 most common occupations six leave a full time year round worker supporting a family of three dependent on food aid some ohio policy makers are pushing legislation to increase work requirements in food assistance and medicaid programs designed to reduce hunger and improve health earning enough at work can restore dignity to workers who despite working are forced to use safety nets that have been severely curtailed safety nets are vital supports for struggling ohioans but businesses should pay the true cost of their workforce enough to get by a 15 minimum wage in place by 2023 would lift wages for 2 million ohio workers 37 percent of the wage earning workforce nearly 1 6 million directly affected workers would receive an average increase of 2 73 per hour in 2018 dollars 26 percent the average directly affected worker puts in 30 6 hours per week and would see an earnings boost of 4 252 another 450 000 workers would benefit from a spillover effect as employers raise wages of those making more than 15 in order to attract and retain their workforces affected workers represent a broad cross section of ohioans raising the wage would especially benefit marginalized workers making it not only an anti poverty measure but a tool to improve fairness in pay most affected workers are adults who have finished school many are raising children most are adult workers who have finished school today s workers earning at or near the minimum wage are overwhelmingly adults over age twenty who have already graduated high school adults outnumber teens more than four to one ohio s median low wage worker is 34 years old many are working to support children and some are the primary or sole breadwinners for their families most 86 percent have already finished high school nearly a quarter have had some college but not finished a degree these include students working through school ohioans with some college are more likely to earn low wages than those with a high school diploma alone 41 percent versus 38 percent in part because they don t yet have a credential to justify the time out of the full time labor market earning a degree is a deep investment that ohioans make in their skills it can help insulate against low wages and unemployment but still over a quarter of associate s degree holders and around 17 percent of those with bachelor s degrees would get a raise under a 15 per hour plan parents and children young children are the likeliest group of ohioans to be in poverty ohio s child poverty rate is 21 3 percent the city of cleveland led the nation in 2017 for child poverty rates nearly half 49 percent of the city s children are in poverty around 518 000 working parents would get a raise if ohio raised its minimum wage to 15 by 2023 that includes 276 000 married parents and 242 000 unmarried parents a higher minimum wage would also affect most of ohio s working teens around 93 4 percent of 16 to 20 year olds currently earn less than 13 05 which is comparable to 15 in 2023 teens in the workforce are saving for ballooning college costs contributing to their families and spending in ways that drive a vibrant economy with firms as profitable as ever earnings for working teens should not be languishing below historic levels more than half of ohio s low wage workers who would benefit from a 15 minimum wage work full time among part time workers the share who are low wage is 71 percent race equity the majority of ohio workers who stand to benefit from a higher minimum wage are white but workers of color are more likely to face low wages black workers comprise about 12 2 percent of ohio workers but 17 8 percent of those who stand to gain from a 15 minimum wage likewise latino workers make up just 3 7 percent of ohio s total employed workforce but nearly 5 7 percent of those who would see a raise white ohioans account for 81 1 percent of ohio workers and 74 6 percent of those whose earnings would rise over the last four decades the gap in pay between black and white workers in ohio has tripled from 1 37 to 4 61 what s even worse black workers wages have fallen by 3 00 per hour the data show black workers shortfall widening by 1 12 in 2016 alone the growing gap may reflect more black workers entering the workforce after being sidelined during the recession and slow recovery and getting jobs in some of the state s most common occupations black workers earnings fell and the race gap widened despite the fact that high school graduation rates grew faster for black ohioans in recent decades college attainment rates grew for both black and white ohioans while black workers wages fell black and white workers both worked a median of 40 hours per week in 2017 one factor which may have played an outsize role in black workers wage decrease is deunionization union membership among black workers fell 21 points from 35 5 percent in 1987 to 14 5 percent by 2017 whereas white workers union rates fell just 10 points black workers were more heavily unionized than white workers in 1987 suggesting that union membership played a substantial role in narrowing the wage gap with the typical black ohioan earning just 13 96 through 2017 it s clear that a living minimum wage would have a tremendous impact an estimated 54 percent of black workers would benefit as would 34 percent of white workers among latino and other workers who self identified as hispanic 54 percent would benefit because so many workers of color earn low wages raising the minimum wage would reduce yawning wage gaps that have grown over the last few decades as a result of policies that have reduced workers ability to bargain for their share of the growing economic pie women ohio women comprise more than their share of low wage workers women make up 48 percent of workers but 55 percent of those who are low wage raising the minimum wage to 15 by 2023 would benefit around 1 1 million working women 42 percent and 917 000 working men 32 percent ohio women earned just 82 cents to the dollar men earned through 2016 and differences persisted across all 20 most female dominated occupations improving pay equity for all ohio women also depends on eliminating the sub minimum wage for tipped workers women comprise 72 percent of tipped workers nationally most as waitresses a 2014 white house report found that nationwide eliminating the tipped sub minimum wage would close nearly 5 percent of the gender wage gap the sub minimum wage ohio s minimum wage leaves out many workers the largest group is tipped workers most of whom work as waitresses tipped workers in ohio are guaranteed just half of the state minimum wage 4 30 effective in 2019 this anomalous carve out is justified on the assumption that workers will make up the difference in tips the law requires employers to pay any shortfall but leaves it to the workers themselves to enforce so when workers come up short employers routinely disregard the law and seldom face consequences wage theft is a crime and the state must begin treating it as such excluding some workers from basic wage protections opens the door to abuse in ohio the typical server earns just 94 percent of the poverty level for a family of three this flaw in ohio s minimum wage structure contributes to other abuse on the job too the restaurant industry is responsible for five times its share of workplace sexual harassment this industry is a point of entry to the workforce for many young women establishing a threshold for mistreatment can continue to hurt women over the course of their careers the sub minimum wage is a legacy of reconstruction era policy that created a sub class of workers who were mostly freed slaves and who worked for tips alone as unpaid servers and railroad porters this special treatment for the restaurant industry was highly controversial when it began as it should be today in ohio letting these employers forego the standard minimum wage undercuts the ability of their employees to earn a living at work and shifts the cost of their workforce onto the safety net ohio should join eight other states in closing the loophole that exempts some employers from paying one fair wage the same minimum wage that applies to all other businesses an economic driver consumer spending generates growth and creates jobs raising the wage floor would generate an estimated 8 7 billion in additional wages annually for directly affected workers benefitting not just those who got raises but also the businesses and other workers in their communities who would gain from the increased spending lower paid workers spend a larger share of their earnings so making wages more equitable boosts the economy business costs raising the minimum wage increases operating costs for businesses but not in proportion to the benefit in increased wages when the greater cleveland foodbank raised its organizational minimum wage to 14 per hour in 2017 its lowest paid workers got a boost of 21 7 percent but foodbank costs went up by just 0 5 percent this makes sense because labor is just one business cost most businesses employ some workers who already earn enough that they would be unaffected and since those workers have higher earnings their individual share of total compensation is larger as more businesses are recognizing the benefit of investing in workers as vital assets more are taking the lead to raise wages on their own including to 15 per hour in ohio these include the cleveland clinic the state s second largest employer and cleveland s largest columbus based nationwide which took an early lead in announcing its policy in 2015 and amazon which drew criticism for whipsawing communities to offer big tax windfalls while many of its warehouse staff rely on public safety nets consumer prices consumers sometimes worry that a higher minimum wage could boost prices research shows that this is true but negligible a recent study found that raising the federal wage to 15 up 107 percent from its current level of 7 25 would lead to a 17 cent increase in the price of a big mac 4 3 percent this reflects the fact that many inputs go into the total cost of producing a big mac like all goods and services and the wages of affected workers are just one of them this means that an increase in the minimum wage would not be meaningfully offset by higher prices jobs a recent survey of 37 reports published from 2000 to 2015 found no support for the proposition that the minimum wage has had an important effect on u s employment even the most cautious studies find increases in earnings far exceed any projected losses from reduced work hours the congressional budget office estimated that by raising the federal minimum wage to 10 10 97 percent of directly affected workers 17 million would get a raise that study projected hours reductions enough to total 500 000 jobs but the likelier scenario is that many more workers would see both a raise and a small reduction in shifts leaving them better off overall if the projected offset were shared among all affected workers then each would work 2 9 percent fewer hours and still take home 11 6 percent more in earnings because the low wage labor market is characterized by inconsistent hours and frequent job changes it is likely that any hours reductions that did occur would be widely shared across many workers who would also get higher hourly earnings the fact that employers have met modest increases in the minimum wage with negligible if any reductions in hours means that our failure to enact more substantial raises is costing low wage workers considerable foregone earnings this report estimates that directly impacted ohio workers would take home some 8 7 billion in additional earnings if ohio passes a 15 minimum wage effective by 2023 conclusion and recommendations ohio voters took a step forward in 2006 when they passed the state minimum wage of 6 85 and indexed it to inflation because of that ohio workers today are covered by a minimum wage that is 1 30 above the federal floor now more than a decade later it s time to take the next step and implement a wage that covers the cost of living for four decades workers have scarcely shared in the economic growth they have helped to make possible the decoupling of wage growth from economic growth is out of sync with history and is the result of policy choices that have weakened workers ability to bargain for fair wages even as workers themselves have increased their education and grown more productive than ever before poor policy choices have created this imbalance good ones must restore it policy recommendations raise the minimum wage to 15 per hour by 2023 set the minimum wage at 12 per hour in 2020 then increase in three equal 1 steps to 15 eliminate the sub minimum wage for tipped workers retain the index to inflation so the wage will not lose value over

q4 2018 was another very good quarter for albany international as strong performance continued across both businesses total company net sales increased 11 or 15 excluding the impact of asc 606 and currency translation effects compared to q4 2017 net income and adjusted ebitda both increased sharply net income increased to 17 million while adjusted ebitda grew to 58 million due to higher sales and productivity improvements in both mc and aec mc sales in the fourth quarter excluding the impact of asc 606 and currency translation effects increased 4 compared to q4 2017 globally mc sales grew in both the packaging and publication grades with particular strength in north america mc gross margin in q4 increased to 48 6 compared to 45 in q4 2017 primarily due to higher sales and improved plant utilization operating income and adjusted ebitda both increased significantly compared to q4 2017 with adjusted ebitda improving to 51 million in the quarter for the full year mc net sales excluding the impact of asc 6069 and currency translation effects increased 3 compared to 2017 with increases in all major paper grades the increase in net sales reflects our continued leadership in product innovation our superior customer service levels and our commitment to outstanding application engineering operating income and adjusted ebitda both increased sharply compared to 2017 with adjusted ebitda growing to 212 million reflecting strong process productivity improvement and the impact of our continuous focus on cost reduction initiatives q4 was another quarter of strong improving performance for aec with significant growth in net sales operating income and adjusted ebitda compared to q4 2017 net sales excluding the impact of asc 606 and currency translation effects increased 34 while profitability continued to improve compared to q4 2017 the increase in sales in q4 was substantially driven by the leap program sales of fan cases fan blades and spacers for leap engines which represented about 44 of aec q4 2018 sales grew 31 compared to q4 2017 reflecting aecâ s continued execution related to the unprecedented steep ramp up of this jet engine program higher sales of boeing 787 fuselage frames as well as f 35 and ch 53k components also contributed to the growth in sales combined sales for these three programs grew 43 compared to q4 2017 aec operating income continued to improve as it grew to 6 7 million in q4 compared to 0 6 million in q4 2017 adjusted ebitda also continued to improve in the quarter as it increased to 18 1 million or 17 9 of net sales compared to 10 8 million or 14 1 of net sales in q4 2017 the increase in both operating income and adjusted ebitda reflects not only higher sales volume but also productivity improvements resulting from the deployment of a disciplined standardized operational system across our aec plants as well as the favorable impact of our continuous improvement program the aec team is improving quality and on time delivery to our customers despite increasing demand and record shipment levels for the full year 2018 aec net sales excluding the impact of asc 606 and currency translation effects increased 36 compared to 2017 exceeding the upper end of the 20 to 30 range we discussed in past quarters sales related to the leap program were the largest driver of this increase along with growth in sales of boeing 787 fuselage frames and f 35 and ch 53k components aecâ s profitability also showed strong improvement in 2018 with sharp increases in operating income and adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda in 2018 grew to 63 million or 17 1 of net sales in r d our new product development activities which focus on existing derivative and new technologies and our process improvement projects which aim to optimize our operational performance across aec continued in q4 to build upon the progress of prior quarters our continued execution on our major existing contracts as well as on anticipated new contract wins provides the potential for aec to reach annual sales of 500 million to 550 million in 2020 as i have stated in previous quarters the potential for aec beyond 2020 will be based not only on executing on the continued ramp up of existing programs on which we are already well established but also on increasing share or acquiring first time content on ramping programs while at the same time winning new contracts on future commercial and defense airframe and engine platforms now letâ s go back to john for more details on the quarter john john cozzolino thank you olivier iâ d like to refer you to our q4 financial performance slides starting with slide three net sales by segment total company net sales in q4 increased 11 compared to q4 2017 and 14 5 excluding both currency and asc 606 effects in q4 excluding currency and asc 606 mc net sales were up 4 5 and aec net sales increased 34 3 compared to q4 last year for the full year 2018 excluding currency and asc 606 effects total company net sales increased 13 6 compared to 2017 with mc sales up 3 3 and aec sales of 35 9 as discussed in the press release in q4 the company discovered implementation issues related to the adoption of asc 606 the issues were related to the mc segment online and caused an immaterial overstatement in revenue and income previously reported in the first nine months of 2018 the issues have been corrected and previously reported amounts for 2018 will be revised in our 2019 quarterly filings we have also incorporated the revised amounts into each of these slides in addition slide nine provides the revised numbers for q1 through q3 2018 for certain financial statement line items and adjusted ebitda turning to slide four total company gross profit margin was 34 9 in q4 compared to 34 2 in q4 2017 aec gross profit margin in q4 was 14 5 compared to 13 1 in q4 last year mc gross profit margin in q4 stayed strong at 48 6 compared to 45 in q4 last year for the full year mc gross profit margin improved to 48 6 in 2018 compared to 47 5 in 2017 and aec improved to 14 2 slides five and six showed net income and adjusted ebitda by segment for the quarter and the full year adjusted ebitda for the total company in q4 2018 was 57 7 million compared to 43 4 million in q4 2017 for the full year 2018 adjusted ebitda for the total company increased to 228 9 million compared to 169 4 million last year mc finished the year strong with adjusted ebitda at 51 2 million bringing the full year total to 212 1 million both results were significant improvements over last year aec adjusted ebitda in q4 was 18 1 million and 63 3 million for the year aec adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales in 2018 improved to 17 1 moving on to slide seven earnings per share net income attributable to the company in q4 was 0 55 per share compared to 0 18 per share in q4 of last year excluding adjustments for restructuring tax items currency revaluation and net impact of a pension settlement charge and a curtailment gain and income attributable to the company was 0 74 per share in q4 compared to 0 44 per share last year on a full year basis net income attributable to the company excluding adjustments was 2 80 per share in 2018 compared to 1 67 per share last year slide eight shows our total debt and net debt cash flow was very good in q4 which included the impact of improved working capital during the quarter as a result total debt decreased just over 5 million to about 525 million at the end of the year while cash balances increased about 37 million to a total of 198 million the combined effect of the decrease and total debt along with the increase in cash resulted in a decrease to net debt of 42 5 million in q4 to a balance of 327 2 million the improvement in net debt in q4 was more than enough to offset the year to date q3 increase as net debt for the year dropped 5 3 million payments for all capital expenditures in q4 2018 were about 22 million we expect capital expenditures to continue to be in the range of 20 million to 25 million per quarter throughout 2019 as the company continues to invest in equipment to support multiple ramp ups in aec now iâ d like to turn it back over to olivier for some additional comments before we go to q a olivier jarrault thanks john now letâ s turn to our outlook looking at 2019 the mc business is well positioned to maintain relatively stable sales with adjusted ebitda once again higher than the historical range of 180 million to 195 million assuming no significant changes in global economic conditions or currency rates we expect 2019 adjusted ebitda to be between 195 million and 205 million in 2019 we expect aec to continue to substantially grow sales with further incremental improvement in profitability compared to 2018 full year 2019 net sales are expected to grow in the range of 20 to 25 driven by higher sales of higher sales of fan blades fan cases and spacers for the leap program and components for the ch 53k f 35 and boeing 787 programs as well as by our advanced technologies development work in support of next gen engine programs adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales should show some incremental improvement compared to 2018 keeping aec on track toward our goal of 18 to 20 adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales in 2020 overall q4 was another very good quarter for the company completing a year of outstanding financial performance in both businesses mc net sales operating income and adjusted ebitda all increased in q4 and for the full year compared to 2017 with adjusted ebitda well ahead of the upper end of the historical range of 180 million to 195 million mc is well positioned for relatively stable sales in 2019 and with the potential for adjusted ebitda in 2019 between 195 million and 205 million aec had another strong quarter with growth in net sales operating income and adjusted ebitda completing a very successful year aec is expected to continue to grow substantially in 2019 with additional incremental improvement in profitability compared to 2018 with that letâ s go to the line for any questions operator question and answer session operator thank you our first question will come from the line of john franzreb with sidoti company go ahead please john franzreb good morning olivier and john olivier jarrault good morning john john franzreb i like to start with your guidance on aec by 2020 the 500 to 550 i guess compared to the fall youâ ve taken up the bottom end of your range by about 25 million could you talk about why you did that is some programs moving forward faster than maybe originally expected six months ago olivier jarrault yes sure you know our growth in 2020 is primarily driven of course to our ability to execute on the ramp up programs on which weâ re very well positioned leap of course the ch 53k the boeing 787 frames as well as the f 35 components so what we need is a very discipline windfall very disciplined process really understanding or reassessing in as accurately as we can without content that we have by platform looking at the growth expansion in 2019 2020 2021 and we came back to those numbers primarily increasing about 25 million based on those measured platform we also took into account some very specific advanced technology development work in support of some very specific nexgen engine program that weâ re working on i canâ t give detail on it but lot of activity going on the r d side of our business and all that made us feel pretty positive about a minimum of 500 million weâ re increasing about 25 iâ ll say versus our last target so 500 to 550 the 550 the upper side of the range would depend on how many new wins we could increase the share gains we could negotiate between â throughout 2019 on either existing programs or other platform â existing platform ramping up so we feel pretty comfortable if you will with that new range john franzreb okay and talking about new wins would you expect something to be announced some time in calendar 2019 in regard new wins olivier jarrault its weâ re working on lot of different potential wins not only i would say on the engine side but also on the airframe side both commercial and defense applications we have recently actually we have recently brought at aec a new vice president of global sales and weâ re in the process of implementing our strategy worldwide we donâ t want to stay only focus on the u s market but we want to expand our activities globally in europe as well not only within the engine commercial and utility but also airframe but also equipment market and we will be announcing any potential wins right for 2019 as soon as it happens john franzreb okay switching over to machine clothing you had a great quarter of ebitda and last year you still projecting very strong ebitda in this year but itâ s slightly down is that a function of your expectations that revenues might be off or is it increased commodity cost that may have to flow through the p l just why we think it would be down in any sense year over year olivier jarrault yes itâ s a good question i mean you know our 2018 was as you said a record earnings year for us and we are â we think that the business i mean mc business is very well positioned in 2019 to again perform and give a very good financial performance right but i think to answer your question its good to maybe look at what really happened in 2018 and how we see the market going in early 2019 so we have in 2018 we have had that you noted strong sales we i talked about improved plant utilization we had as you know a pretty favorable set of â could i say favorable currencies environment especially the mexican pesos and the brazilian money and we had a fairly stable and favorable macro economic condition we saw if you look back what we talked about end of q3 and again in this quarter we saw some increases in our publication rights pmc sale especially in the second half of 2018 across north america europe asia pacific driven by some specific orders especially in north america we donâ t know if those orders will repeat or not in 2019 in addition we saw in 2018 which i noted at the end of the third quarter we saw an increase in our tissue grades pmc sales especially in north america but also in europe and asia pacific related to several specific new machines started once again weâ re going to see them at the same level in 2019 we still donâ t know yet so as we enter in 2019 if i look at the overall macroeconomic data right we know that overall growth ended around 3 7 in 2018 estimated to continue in 2019 but definitely i think at a slower pace than 2018 however there are significant how could i say uncertainty thereâ s no secret that the chinese economy is slowing down in 2019 it did slowdown in 2018 already we have trade ongoing â trade negotiations between china and the u s we have the undefined nature of brexit we have all those political uncertainties in several countries in europe such as france with the gilet jaunes germany with a chancellor and so on only south america is actually improving so those issues may have an impact on the global economy growth and our mc markets during 2019 however its very important for me to note that we continue however to believe that during the next five years the paper and paperboard production will continue to increase as we recently published by risi at about 1 to 1 5 per year right about 1 4 actually if i could read so now if i look at strictly at the pmc market if you were going into 2019 let me share with you my view right our view on the pmc market globally so the u s pmc market which is our largest market seems to be more or less stable due to packaging and tissues grades consumption increases offsetting more or less decline in publication grades consumption especially in newsprint switching to canada the canadian pmc market will continue to shrink we think that mainly due to continued publication grades consumption decline especially once again in newsprint we switch to brazil the pmc market will be essentially flat we believe due to favorable economic conditions but with the slowdown of export of pulp grades to china if you look at europe the european pmc market will continue to drop as a result of growth in the packaging grades consumption with machines conversions from printing and writing to packaging machines that however as i already mentioned last quarter consumed less pmc than publication machine and then if you switch to asia pacific the southeast asia pmc market will be more or less stable with china pmc market we know that it will keep on shrinking as a result of lower chinese production of packaging grades due to environmental issues and what weâ re hearing about ongoing restrictions on imported recycled fiber so when you look at if you put that into consideration we think that pmc business is well positioned to relatively keep the same level of sale and deliver good financial performance ahead of the range of 180 to 195 at 195 205 as a result i would say the combined effects of volume a little bit of labor inflation or material inflations and as i just noted some product mix so we will â one thing for sure that weâ ll deliver a good performance we will continue a very important point for us from the strategy standpoint we will continue our technical and service levels focus on packaging and tissue grades as weâ re clearly in the leadership position while of course continuing to manage the decrease in publication grades our product innovation and technology leadership and our focus on providing superior value to our customers talking about cost effective solutions iâ m talking about top level â top service levels in terms of one time deliver in terms of lead time iâ m talking about our quality levels will be best to resist against market pressure and weâ ll enable us to maintain our global leader position in the market right thatâ s our view for 2019 john franzreb all right perfect thank you sir iâ ll get back into queue olivier jarrault thank you operator our next question will come from the line of christian herbosa with noble capital markets your line is open christian herbosa hi thanks for taking my call and congrats on the great quarter olivier jarrault good morning christian nice to have you on the call christian herbosa thank you so looks like in q4 the aec segment was already close to achieving the low end of your 2020 adjusted ebitda margin target range of 18 to 20 so my question is do you think that the aec segment has the potential to improve beyond that range olivier jarrault well listen we have to look at the performance of this year versus performance of last year last year i believe we did in 2017 once you exclude one or couple of unfavorability of couple of contracts when it was unfortunately on us we did roughly on the adjusted basis about 30 million of ebitda or 11 we had a good i would say a good operationally improvement as you noted the full year 2018 63 million roughly of ebitda and 17 1 of ebitda margin that put us i would say that position the business properly i believe to now go from 63 million to a roughly say 100 million of ebitda in 2020 i think itâ s a very healthy goal itâ s only the 18 to 20 of the 500 to 550 range in volume so i stick on that goal once again 30 million last year 60 million 63 million this year thatâ s keep on continuing to ramp up to executes on this multiple ramp up to keep on deploying across all our aec plant a discipline operational in the management system and we have seen that it starting really pay off we have brought in actually in the past five or six months a very experienced new aerospace leadership team especially on the aec side right to manage that unprecedented steep ramp up of the leap brand new leader on the operational side brand new finance leader brand new quality leader brand new lean manufacturing so weâ re really bringing a lot of aerospace if you will â aerospace global aerospace experienced at aec and i feel comfortable about that 100 million of ebitda target itâ s a very healthy growth for 2020 christian herbosa okay great thank you for the color there and then so iâ m interested in hearing a little bit more about the new product development activities in r d for the aec segment are there any particularly attractive opportunities that youâ re able to tell us about olivier jarrault well there are lot of work as i was mentioning and i cannot really publicly ready to talk about give you more and more detail but thereâ s a lot of work if you will lot of advanced technology development work that is going on in support of some very how could i say some combination of next generation jet engine platforms that weâ re being very much involved with and that will be more and more involved with that does include if you will tweaking improving our existing technologies which i call derivatives technologies especially on the on the 3d woven rtm resin transfer molding technology weâ re looking at other also very very interesting potential applications both on the commercial and the military side on the airframe side so itâ s all very exciting but i cannot give that any detail on that until we come out with contract and so on a lot of very exciting lot of very exciting work that really will fuel our growth in â organic growth in 2020 and past 2020 christian herbosa okay good thanks iâ ll stay tune there and then so the last one from me is on the leap engine program it contributes about 44 aec sales in q4 so do you expect leap program percentage of revenue to expand from there in 2019 olivier jarrault well we know the leap â if you look at the leap the rights announced publicly by cfm right weâ re going in 2019 with 1800 plus engines versus 1118 engines delivered by cfm in 2018 thatâ s to be compared with 459 right in 2017 then weâ ll go â cfm is talking about 2000 right we donâ t know yet number for 2020 so weâ ll keep on saying that increased in leap component sales in 2019 and 2020 and the percentage would stay around somewhere on that range in the 40 to 45 range i mean that would be some though that we have had very interesting growth on the ch 53k also and on the combined fuselage frame for ch 53k and f 35 grew about 40 and youâ re going to start seeing continued ramp up also on those three platforms as boeing 787 which was 14 in june of 2019 and the f 35 and ch 53k keep on expanding build rights christian herbosa okay great thank you thatâ s all from me thanks for your time olivier jarrault thank you operator and our next question will come from the line of pete skibitski with alembic global go ahead pete skibitski hey good morning guys maybe couple of financial questions to start on the full year free cash flow results i think in terms of conversion is about 0 6 times free cash to net income and iâ m wondered if you guys have a target for free cash flow conversion and should we think that working capital will be a use of funds each year just because of kind of where youâ re at in the supply chain and kind of nature of your receivables and contract assets performance can you give us some color on that john cozzolino yes so hi pete this is john iâ ll start with that so right now when you look at the free cash and weâ re really â we are still on the mode of fairly high capex we talked about â thatâ s probably one of the bigger factors in the cash flow at 20 million to 25 million in quarter where the good chunk of that going towards aec now the real key here will be when that starts to drop off hopefully after 2019 as we have those programs ramped up at that point the free cash flow generation will grow significantly now the other part of that is the working capital and we do also continue to invest in working capital to support those ramps a lot has been done to really improve the efficiency of that and weâ ll continue to keep looking at but once we reach the whole ramp on these programs working capital should level off and that should also help the free cash flow so thatâ s really where we are right now going forward olivier jarrault yes i think you know what weâ re being doing â what youâ re just starting to see in q4 right i mean we had a very nice cash flow of 42 million in q4 we dropped down our total net back to 27 million it was very nice improvement for the full year right we had 5 million in cash cash flow and we are as john was saying we are putting a lot of focus in the past now two quarters on the aec side to really manage much more efficiently i would say our working capital a lot of focus on inventory i would say a lot of daily focus from my side directly in receivables on the aerospace side and on inventory and more and more focus throughout the 2019 since we really want to ensure that the aec business focuses not only on ebitda growth on ramping up right â ramping up the volume that i just talk about and delivering a step improvement in ebitda margin towards the ebitda but also to start focusing on generating some free cash flow thatâ s where my goal is and so we had done i think very nice improvement in q3 q4 and i think that will definitely keep on happening in 2019 and 2020 right okay pete skibitski right a appreciate the color just a follow up on the capex side do you think that maybe the midterm or the long term as a percentage of revenue maybe capex could come down to kind of the mid single digit level kind of once this ramp is over and also how was the potential launch of 797 or nma how will that impact the outlook for capex john cozzolino i think to answer you question i think that you know we view the once we have brought in â once we have brought the equipment to support the growth of the â the growth of this ch 53k the f 35 we have to keep on bringing equipment this year for the ge9x donâ t forget we are right that weâ re producing the fund cashes of the ge9x the entered in service four aircraft in 2019 but we keep on receiving equipment weâ re going to have to think also as you just mentioned about the potential right uhbr the nma which could play both on the engine and also on the airframe side i think about in the range of 60 million a year right i think itâ s a fair number to keep in mind i mean the 60 right for the total company okay pete skibitski thatâ s very helpful appreciate it last one from me and appreciate all the color this airbus emirates news about talking about the a380 how are you guys thinking about that is it too early for you to comment on it or iâ m just wondering what that potential financial impact could be to you if the rate on the a380 isnâ t coming down olivier jarrault iâ m not worried at all about the a380 no its not â i mean for some of us who are doing pretty well in the aerospace industry it s not a very big news right we knew it would come one day or another right so we have a very marginal content on the a380 so very very marginal from sort of salt lake city business so i mean for us it has absolutely no impact actually i look forward to an increase i would say almost an increase in rate of a350 because we have some potential maybe some potential business to play there right i mean from salt lake city business right so an increase in a350 or an increase in of the a330 and it would be actually quite good news for us so iâ m â actually iâ m very pleased with the news pete skibitski got it got it itâ s very helpful thank you guys olivier jarrault okay youâ re very welcome nice to talk to you operator weâ ll go next to the line of mitchel go ahead unidentified analyst good morning olivier jarrault good morning nice to have you unidentified analyst thank you so you talked about a lot of analysts have called and talked about the possibility of new wins in the future just based on the pipeline can you give us a range of what that those new wins could equate to as far as you know dollar size olivier jarrault well first of all you have to think about which horizon right where youâ re thinking about right i mean i think if you i guess your question is more related to 2020 right unidentified analyst and beyond yes olivier jarrault yes 2020 i would say that you know depending on the timing right of those anticipated new share gain share gains or new first time component acquisition on existing platforms that are ramping up to date i think i think if everything was to materialize on time the probability is right that they took that we took in our calculation that would give us roughly that would bring us to the upper side of my range right to 550 is about 25 million right you know right to all the 550 thatâ s what i view as of today unidentified analyst all right thank you olivier jarrault welcome operator we do have a follow up question from the line of john franzreb of sidoti company go ahead please john franzreb maybe to ask a previous question a different way the target margin for aec has been that range for a while olivier when you were at alcoa you were known for improving productivity at existing operations youâ ve been there a year now my question is do you think that the aec businesses is operating at optimal productivity or is there margin improvement opportunity based on your view on how the business is performing right now versus maybe a couple of years from now olivier jarrault listen i mean they are always right productivity improvements to be achieved right and i think listen how could i how could i summarize it i feel much more comfortable today about the 100 million ebitda target in 2020 than i was a year ago when i saw the business operating at 30 million ebitda right and 11 ebitda margin right so i think youâ d agree with me that all the system that we have deployed all the metrics and all the all our operating system that we have put in place drew right double right acquisition volume as well but executing on the ramp up plus putting the productivity programs in place you know helped us going to 63 million right so thatâ s about 17 1 if i look at my past experience right you know of ebitda margin experience of improvement across aerospace businesses i think that targeting you know one point to one point and a half right you know of ebitda improvement is of good range right is good thatâ s what iâ ve been doing in the past 10 years to 15 years across casting businesses forging businesses fastening and so on so you know with 17 you know add point and a half thatâ s why iâ m pretty comfortable about delivering right in the 18 to 20 range right and then from there we will continue going right in the out years right john franzreb okay fair enough i give it a shot thank you sir olivier jarrault thank you operator we have no further questions in queue at this time you may proceed olivier jarrault well again thank you all for joining the call we appreciate your time today and your continued interest in albany international i would like also to congratulate my albany team on a strong finish to 2018 thank

however neither officials nor ordinary russians were ready for such a quick breakdown of the economic system overnight some became very rich while others were reduced to abject squalor state institutions including fiscal mechanisms hadn t been established as a result economic growth was much lower than its potential and the treasury experienced huge tax losses in the space of six years this led to the 1998 crisis when the state defaulted on government short term bonds china never experienced such shocks there was no instant ten fold or hundred fold increase in prices the division gap in of the population did happened but gradually at the same time some economists argue that a complete transition to a market economy is impossible without unpopular socio political reforms they note indeed in contrast to the ussr china was able to secure for itself a double digit growth rate for a many years without a drastic liberalisation of markets however a planned economy and state intervention by themselves create structural imbalances which each year only increase china as they insist has just come to the conclusion that without serious reforms growth cannot be sustained chinese conference participants however criticised the model of full and one stage market liberalization they argued that countries with transitional economies in such situations immediately lose all their competitive advantages thus only other economically strong states earn from their liberalization in china there s a fundamentally different model for public investment than in the west this makes china less vulnerable to external shocks according to former world bank senior vice president professor lin yifu the advantage of the chinese authorities is that they have a mature understanding of the economic situation and all trends are monitored every month in order to understand the real situation the scholar said adding that every quarter every six months and every year dynamic data is updated read more uk china free trade prospects after brexit raise questions scholar he continued that therefore measures were taken as soon as any changes are noticed citing an example of the problem of local government debt when the chinese authorities announced a company to deal with leverage they also announced a structural reform of the proposal which consists of five points the elimination of excess production capacity overstocking the fight against leverage cost reduction and the strengthening of weak points deleveraging means a reduction of the credit burden of local governments here we must beware of so called black swans if earlier local governments borrowed through special investment platforms now they are allowed to issue construction bonds themselves and then directly exchange them for a loan from a bank what is good here loans are short term and construction bonds are long term thus you have to constantly refinance debt of course if local governments conducted long term borrowing this would significantly reduce credit risks but the chinese authorities are closely monitoring the real economic situation lin yifu stated western experts say that china using its old methods will no longer be able to stimulate its slowing economy during the 2008 crisis the chinese authorities pumped credit into the economy moreover the central authorities did not accumulate much debt the main burden fell on local governments which were responsible for social and infrastructure projects and had to account for the growth rates of the economies of the territories under their jurisdiction however now the credit level has grown to such proportions that many local governments are not able to service the existing debt let alone talk about increasing the credit load lin yifu believes that the local government debt problem is artificially exaggerated by western economists according to the expert the debt burden in china is significantly lower than in many western countries i think the problem of local government debt is greatly exaggerated the debt of the central and local authorities combined do not exceed 60 of gdp which is very small by global standards at the same time central government debt is only 17 of gdp the debt of local governments including borrowings of local governments through private companies accounts for 40 read more bit by bit reasons behind china s apparent hesitancy to buy gold china has a fundamentally different investment model from those of the western countries there governments borrow to spend on social needs such as unemployment benefits and social protection
we re way overdue for a sell everything recession one that the fed will only make worse by pursuing its usual policies of lowering interest rates and goosing easy money as i noted last week central banks like generals always fight the last war until the war is lost the global economy is careening into recession call it a slowdown if you are employed by the corporate state media and while we don t yet know just how deep and wide this recession will be we can make an educated guess that it won t be a repeat of any of the previous five recessions 1973 74 1981 82 1990 91 2001 02 or 2008 09 recessions triggered by energy or financial crises tend to be short and shallow as the crisis soon eases recessions caused by structural imbalances tend to be enduringly brutal many recessions are structural but the triggering event is a short term crisis some recessions ravage specific sectors but leave most of the economy relatively unscathed others disrupt virtually everything even the generally impervious to recession government sector let s run down the general outlines of the previous five recessions if you ve lived long enough you ve experienced the suffering firsthand younger readers will have difficulty relating firsthand but understanding the dynamics is the goal here and so direct experience is a bonus not an essential 1973 74 the oil shock to the u s economy as opec raised prices and punished the u s for supporting israel in the 1973 yom kippur war created havoc long lines at gas stations and a sharp downturn a k a recession though the economy supposedly recovered statistically in 1975 the structural issues that were laid bare by the recession continued eroding the economy for the next six years the u s industrial base had become accustomed to getting away with rising prices and stagnant quality the rise of competing industrial nations such as germany and japan and the resulting imbalance in trade flows that undermined the u s dollar s gold backed status required a massive reset of america s financial and industrial sectors the higher cost of energy revealed the inefficiencies of the u s economy and coupled with the public demand to clean up industrial pollution the industrial sectors were forced into a disruptive and costly reset the fed s only solution to any slowdown easy money fueled runaway inflation the key takeaway here was the structural problems were not financial and as a result the usual fed tricks of easy money failed to fix what was broken instead loose fiscal and monetary policy made the situation much worse on top of a major reworking of fundamental issues such as energy pollution and global competition the policies of the fed and congress added runaway inflation to an already dicey situation the next recession in 1981 82 was devastating as the can could no longer be kicked down the road inflation destroys wealth savings industries that rely on credit and trust in the institutions of the central bank and state fed chair paul volcker jacked up interest rates laying waste to auto sales and housing and slowly but surely inflation was tamed at great cost although political credit is generally given to president reagan who took office in 1981 the painful decade long structural reworking of the u s economy finally began to bear fruit in the 1980s the counterculture techies and immigrants andy grove of intel intc et al in silicon valley launched the digital revolution energy prices dropped and stabilized as the petro dollar system was institutionalized and the economy normalized high interest rates home buyers cheered when mortgage rates slowly declined to a low low 10 a big improvement over 12 mortgages booms tend to generate financial crises of excessive debt and speculation aided and abetted by regulatory lapses and the 1980s birthed the saving and loan crisis a completely foreseeable and needless implosion of fraudulent s ls which sprang up like evil weeds in the loosening of basic banking statutes it didn t take much to open an s l in some states sell a passel of 100 000 cds and burn the proceeds on housing speculation and high living the oil spike that preceded the first gulf war was the boulder that started the landslide the recession was brief but it was enough to cost george bush i the election of 1990 people famously vote their pocketbooks but the damage was relatively minimal in terms of fundamentals and the roaring 90s took off once president bill clinton declared the era of big government was over and fiscal restraint came back into vogue the explosive rise of the internet fueled a spectacular stock market bubble in tech stocks and as with all bubbles the eventual popping of the dot com bubble crushed the fortunes of anyone who bought near the top and held on to sell near the bottom hundreds of once high flying companies vanished or were bought by survivors for fractions of their dot com bubble valuations as usual the fed s solution to the 2001 02 downturn was to open the credit spigots and lower interest rates even though liquidity and interest rates weren t what was wrong with the economy this monomaniacal policy inflated a monumental housing bubble in 2004 2008 and once again loosened regulations liar loans no doc loans 100 mortgages fraudulent mortgage backed securities etc plus low interest rates and abundant fed liquidity created a bubble that was guaranteed to implode with devastating consequences no longer content with blowing one credit speculative bubble at a time central bankers coordinated their efforts in 2009 2018 and inflated the everything bubble but the everything bubble didn t resolve or even address the multiple structural imbalances in the u s and global economies it merely papered them over with a triple whammy credit speculative orgy of unprecedented enormity unlike the 1970s 80s 90s and 2000s wages earned income did not rise for the bottom 90 during the central bank everything bubble 2009 2018 it isn t just the stock buybacks and other financier speculations that are funded by debt a great deal of consumption that was once paid out of earnings revenues is now paid by debt higher education paving of roads auto repairs etc rather than restructure the economy the political and financial elites have papered over the imbalances with debt debt we re assured is harmless we re going to grow our way out of debt by borrowing more but borrowing more to consume more isn t increasing productivity and this is one reason why wages have stagnated and prices have soared in the past decade the instabilities and imbalances of economies can be papered over with debt for a time but debt and financialization tricks don t actually fix what s broken they make the problems worse welcome to the recession of 2019 2021 when central bank policies are finally revealed as the source of half our problems rather than the solution we re way overdue for a sell everything recession one that the fed will only make worse by pursuing its usual policies of lowering interest rates and goosing easy money the structural problems are now acute and giving more free money to financiers and politically powerful corporations isn t going to fix what s broken in the u s economy editor s note the summary bullets for this article were chosen by seeking alpha editors
both the wgc and lbma published outlooks for the global economy and gold market in 2019 who is right wgc s outlook for gold in 2019 let s start from the world gold council wgc which published its 2019 outlook on january 10th as befits the organization representing industry s interests the wgc is bullish on gold prices no surprises here according to the institution the following trends will mainly shape the gold market in 2019 financial market instability monetary policy and the us dollar and structural economic reforms first the wgc expects higher levels of risk and uncertainty this year due to the elevated market volatility rising political and economic instability in europe think about brexit social unrest in france populist government in italy or secessionism in spain and potential higher inflation from protectionist policies all these factors are said to increase the likelihood of a global recession nudging investors toward gold as an effective portfolio diversifier and a safe haven second the wgc admits that although market risk will likely remain high higher interest rates and us dollar s strength could limit gold s upside however the organization believes that the greenback may be losing steam while the positive effect of higher federal funds rate on the dollar will diminish as the fed s monetary policy stance becomes neutral third the wgc argues that pro growth economic reforms implemented in india and china would support consumer demand and thus gold prices this claim is the weakest and we refuted many times the argument that consumer demand drives the gold prices actually the opposite is true i e consumers are price takers not price setters however we could sign under the previous two points we also believe that the dollar s upside is limited while the pace of fed s tightening is slowing down and we do agree that the level of political and market risks is somewhat higher than last year although we would not overestimate the europe s weakness despite its fragility it still grows lbma s global macroeconomic outlook for 2019 2020 let s move on now to the lbma s outlook actually the presented view was not formulated by the london bullion market association but by adam posen president of the peterson institute for international economics whose keynote speech fromthe lbma lppm conference inboston on 28 30th october 2018 was published in the recent issue of the alchemist we will analyze other articles in the next edition of the gold news monitor according to him there are four key trends to keep in mind for the coming twoyears a shift fromfinancial risk to political risk the reinforcement of a long term negative productivity trend the increasing risk of inflation and economic and political turmoil in latin america first the author argues that the us turns isolationist and nationalist which lowers the political stability all around the world the uncertainty is higher while investment subdued we agree with that second the current protectionism and anti investment politics will aggravate the problem of sluggish productivity growth it s important not only because it implies slower economic growth but also because the economy has less room to run hot there is not fast technological progress which could counterbalance the inflationary pressure hence and this is the third point we have an inflation risk which could materialize in the second half of the year forcing the fed to more aggressive actions so far inflation has been limited but the upward risk exists certainly fourth although the fed s tightening cycle will not put all emerging markets into trouble latin america is particularly at risk think about the economic disaster in venezuela immigration crisis in columbia or many questions marks regarding bolsonaro s brazil taking all these factors into account posen is bullish on gold arguing that overall political economic framework will be at the marginpushing up values for gold a more politically uncertain environment incentives people to holdtheir assets in non currency assets a more inflationary environment even one not hugely inflationary but one with more upside risk toinflation is something that incentivises people to move into gold andother precious metals a more politically fragmented system where the riskof large currency swings is high further reinforcesthis a low productivity growth environment is onethat reduces the relative gains of taking speculativerisk in other forms of investment which should alsomove you towards gold implications for gold ladies and gentlemen we have a draw both the wgc and lbma alchemist s article by posen present convincing arguments that fundamentals are moving in the direction of gold although we question some of the details we agree with the general outlook for the gold market in 2019 this year might be indeed better for the yellow metal than 2018 we do not expect a global recession and a rally in gold prices but we do expect that 2019 will be more supportive for the gold prices at the margin

financial measure in this press release because it is a key measure used by quotient s management and board of directors to understand and evaluate core operating performance and trends to prepare and approve its annual budget to develop short and long term operational plans and to determine bonus payouts in particular quotient believes that the exclusion of certain items of income and expenses in calculating adjusted ebitda can provide a useful measure for period to period comparisons of its core business additionally adjusted ebitda is a key financial metric used by the compensation committee of our board of directors in connection with the determination of compensation for our executive officers accordingly quotient believes that adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating quotient s operating results in the same manner as quotient s management and board of directors quotient defines adjusted ebitda as net income loss adjusted for interest expense provision for benefit from income taxes depreciation and amortization stock based compensation change in fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration net other income expense net charges related to enterprise resource planning erp software implementation costs certain acquisition related costs and restructuring charges we exclude these items because we believe that these items do not reflect expected future operating expenses additionally certain items are inconsistent in amounts and frequency making it difficult to contribute to a meaningful evaluation of our current or past operating performance quotient s use of adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of quotient s financial results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are although depreciation and amortization are non cash expenses the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements and adjusted ebitda does not reflect i changes in or cash requirements for working capital needs ii interest and tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to quotient iii the effects of stock based compensation amortization of acquired intangible assets interest expense other income expense net provision for benefit from income taxes change in fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration net charges related to erp software implementation costs certain acquisition related costs and restructuring charges other companies including companies in its industry may calculate adjusted ebitda or similarly titled measures differently which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure this non gaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation from as substitute for or as superior to the corresponding financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap because of these and other limitations adjusted ebitda should be considered along with other gaap

as bitcoin breaks new records in terms of trading volume in venezuela the government has issued new fees as part of its efforts to regulate cryptocurrency remittances the national superintendency of crypto assets and related activities sunacrip is now the regulator for cryptocurrencies in venezuela as part of that new mandate it has established a monthly transaction limit for remittances whilst collecting taxes of up to 15 of the transaction amount the new regulations were first published last thursday in gaceta oficial no 41581 with sunacrip taking to twitter shortly afterwards to confirm the development a cryptocurrency enthusiast went on to comment on that twitter thread outlining the absurdity of the attempt to tax and regulate this is a mockery and just look at those commissions they want to regulate the unregulatable ha ha ha good luck the new regulation sets out in general terms what is required in terms of procedures and payments together with the responsibilities of those sending or receiving cryptocurrency funds charges on cryptocurrency remittances will range from between 0 25 0 28 to a maximum of 15 according to cripto noticias sunacrip has been mandated to establish limits on the amounts to be sent and it s understood this will be 10 petros the venezuelan state cryptocurrency established by the crisis hit south american nation last year this threshold corresponds with a u s dollar equivalent value of 600 per month the amount can be exceeded but only with the permission of the regulator up to 50 petro s 3 000 may be authorized once authorization has been obtained otherwise the newly empowered regulator is required to establish the exchange rate of various cryptocurrencies with the sovereign bolivar venezuela s national fiat currency it will use the official exchange rates set by the central bank of venezuela bcv to achieve this the agency has the power to request data from both the senders and receivers of digital currency at the end of last month the national constituent assembly anc of venezuela issued an edict which established a legal framework for the cryptocurrency industry in the sanctions hit country the decree provides for a set of rules for cryptocurrency miners traders and those otherwise involved in the industry the document titled constituent decree on the integral system of crypto assets sets out legal definitions for a range of cryptocurrency related terms additionally it establishes compulsory licensing for miners and exchanges with a fine structure in place for those deemed to be carrying out unlicensed activity in the event that any entity contravenes licensing rules company owners could be exposed to fines of up to 6 000 and one to three years in prison according to cripto noticias the rules also empower sunacrip with the ability to inspect mining companies and confiscate hardware if that company is found to be in breach of the new laws the imposition of regulations occurs as venezuela achieves a new all time high in terms of bitcoin trading volume data related to trading activity on peer to peer trading platform local bitcoins demonstrates that venezuelans traded 2 485 bitcoin for the week ending february 9 2019 this compares with a volume of 318 bitcoin a year earlier however the vast bulk of that growth in volume has come about over the course of the last 3 months it would appear that the venezuelan state is attempting to control the flow of capital via cryptocurrency the fees imposed through the new regulations are excessive world bank statistics point to average remittance fees worldwide ranging from 5 2 to 9 4 these fees are already high but for venezuela to impose fees of up to 15 makes the use of cryptocurrency prohibitively expensive a prolonged financial crisis in venezuela brought about through a combination of financial mismanagement and economic sanctions imposed by the united states has seen the destruction of personal wealth due to the hyper inflation that has followed the crisis has led to the largest mass migration in the recent history of south america read more bitcoin accepted for public transport across 37 cities in argentina
