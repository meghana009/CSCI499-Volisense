by crescat capital read pdf version an important ratio of commodity versus equity valuations just reached a fresh 50 year low resembling two prior significant cyclical us stock market peaks in 1972 and 2000 macro imbalances there is a laundry list of dangerous assets bubbles in the global financial markets today that have built up over a record long us economic expansion highest ever global debt to gdp levels a passive investing and etf craze that has led to historic lofty us equity valuations across a composite of fundamental measures tracked by crescat impossibly valued currency and credit markets in china at an extreme for any large country relative to the size of its economy china s banking assets are valued at usd 41 trillion including substantial hidden non performing loans in our analysis a major mismatch compared to its much smaller and stumbling 13 6 trillion gdp economy record 17 trillion of negative yielding sovereign debt which may have just peaked in august 2019 private equity vc excesses in opaque assets highly leveraged companies and frequently unprofitable businesses masquerading as new economy disruptors record indebtedness of us public and private corporations combined relative to gdp crowded risk parity positioning among large hedge funds and institutions who are long stocks paired with leveraged long bonds a strategy that worked exceptionally well in a forty year backtest as well as the last ten years that it has become popular but it s one that would likely get decimated in a rising inflation paradigm fashionable short volatility strategies which are yield enhancement strategies for an income starved world but the extra yield is earned in exchange for accepting asymmetric downside risk high valuations and crowding into sectors traditionally viewed as defensive including utilities reits and consumer staples with utilities being the most fundamentally questionable among them in our view and tech bubble 2 0 with extraordinary valuations in saas certain fang stocks many recent ipos catalysts the unwinding of these imbalances is likely to be highly destructive to the investment portfolios of unprepared global savers today below we list the confluence of macroeconomic timing signals including social and geopolitical forces now bearing down for an assault on overvalued financial assets most of these have been uncanny warning signs directly ahead of past bear markets and business cycle peaks in the us the treasury yield curve recently exceeded the critical 70 inversion threshold that has preceded each of the last six recessions with no false signals the conference board s consumer expectations survey has diverged strongly to the downside compared to its unsustainably high present situation index job openings are declining while the lagging and contrarian unemployment rate is at cyclical lows both the atlanta and new york fed s real time gdp trackers have been trending steadily down for almost two years and appear to be approaching recessionary levels corporate earnings of the russell 3000 already contracted on a year over year basis in the last reported quarter us share buybacks are now 30 lower than 2018 increased

the housing bust auto loan spreads rising as delinquency rates rise net exports of services now falling the most since the gfc and tech bust increased election uncertainty and rising political polarization creates unknown binary opposite outcomes for future tax policy which is now friendly for financial markets but could swing 180 degrees trump impeachment proceedings might impair his credibility in maintaining a hyped up economic narrative in face of deteriorating macro fundamentals and new bipartisan willingness to embrace fiscal stimulus and rising government deficits could change the inflation paradigm sooner rather than later and be detrimental to financial assets worldwide yield curve inversion with the us dollar as the world reserve currency versus an unprecedented 19 economies now with 30 year yields below usd libor overnight rates like the us hong kong canada and japan all recently breached critical 70 inversion levels within their sovereign yield curves emerging market currencies have been falling despite recent easy fed policies indicating that dollar liquidity globally is still tight amidst record dollar denominated foreign debt ongoing trade and cold war between the world s two leading economies with diametrically opposed political systems each with its own historically extreme financial imbalances the china yuan recently broke the key 7 level and looks poised for an accelerated devaluation that would almost certainly take global investors by surprise tariff increases that go into effect in december are a catalyst for an rmb shock if trade negotiations continue to stall which is our base case accelerated yuan depreciation is the rhino in the room that would be a likely contagious global risk off event feeding back to us european as well as other asian and emerging markets as we have seen on multiple occasions since 2015 with only minor devaluations there have already been material disruptions in the global manufacturing supply chain due to the trade war frontloading of chinese semiconductor inventory and capex spending in 2019 amidst the threat of escalating us intellectual property purchase restrictions sets up earnings weakness ahead for this market leading but cyclically vulnerable industry the global manufacturing pmi has already dropped to recessionary levels multiple political and economic crises have already been erupting in emerging and frontier markets rising populism and nationalism more generally around the globe is causing disruption in world trade and financial markets and last but not least brexit the two closest analogs to today s excessive fundamental valuations for us stocks were the 2000 tech bubble and the culmination of the roaring twenties in 1929 our work suggests that today s valuations are even higher than those two periods the nifty fifty stock mania of 1972 is another comparable period that featured excessive valuations in a popular group of large cap growth stocks that became widely regarded as blue chip buy and hold positions institutions and retail investors were taught to cling to these stocks through thick and thin throwing fundamental analysis and valuation principles out the window the same idea is the prevalent passive investing dogma of today from today s valuations a mere cyclical mean reversion in stock market multiples implies a 50 drawdown in prices yet too many investors remain oblivious to these valuation risks many today have further been lulled into believing that central banks have their backs and will keep markets rising such bullish sentiment on the heels of recent fed liquidity injections has emboldened a late cycle speculative push higher in the indices even as the market internals have been noticeably deteriorating never mind that the last two fed easing cycles after tightening cycles coincided with and were confirmations of major bear markets and recessions underway rather than prevention of them a perfect predictor of recessions so far the recent distortions in the us treasury yield curve are among the most relevant macro indicators supporting crescat s bearish thesis and positioning today our comprehensive calculation shows that across all 44 spreads of the yield curve the percentage of them that are inverted spiked to 73 just three months ago in august this is a critical timing signal as we show in the chart below because in the five prior business cycle expansions that we studied we found that when 70 or more of the yield curve first inverts a recession soon follows in all but one case those recessions were accompanied bear market declines in stocks three of them were close to 50 collapses in the s p 500 index how to profit from yield curve inversions from a portfolio management perspective we have determined that buying gold and selling stocks is one of the most compelling macro investment ideas after inversions reach excessive levels since 1970 our analysis shows that when the yield curve first exceeds 70 inversions in a business cycle expansion the gold to s p 500 ratio performed exceptionally well on average in the following two years returning close to 90 while stocks lost almost 1 3 of their value on average the only time buying this ratio didn t work was during the s l crisis yet back then equity valuations were quite the opposite from today we think the 70 inversions that immediately preceded the 1973 4 inflationary recession and tech bust have the most comparable setups to today both of those times the numerator and denominator of this ratio worked extremely well for the ensuing 2 year period resulting in an average gain in the gold to s p 500 ratio of 147 excluding dividends the intriguing fact here is that the commodities to equity ratio was near historic lows at the peak of those two stock bubbles nifty fifty and tech as shown by the first chart in our letter above today s macro set up looks remarkably similar perhaps even more extreme gold is near record undervalued relative to the size of global monetary base and money supply at the same time equity valuations relative to their underlying fundamentals are arguably at their highest ever negative real rates across the whole treasury curve uber bullish for gold the entire treasury curve now yields less than core cpi it s the second time in history we have seen this the first being in early 2016 when precious metals mining stocks exploded that time the fed had already hiked rates at the end of 2015 and was in quantitative tightening mode this time the fed has cut interest rates three times in three months and has returned to quantitative easing at an alarming 45 annualized rate with 15 trillion worth of sovereign bonds with negative yields and central banks easing globally we believe precious metals are in the early stages of a multi year bull market economy weakening as inflation rising when we look at the chain of events historically it s fed tightening late in the business cycle that leads to yield curve inversions and then recessions by the time the fed starts easing it s a confirmation that the downturn is ripe to unfold when such times have also coincided with stocks at record valuations severe equity bear markets have ensued today given the historic levels of debt and macro imbalances worldwide the next decline could easily be among the worst in us history given all the warning signs we think investors should prepare urgently if they have not already in our view a new wave of global fiat debasement policies is in its early stages and a shift in the inflation paradigm could be near to get a glimpse of this in the us note how the atlanta fed s gdp nowcast has already been declining in the face of rising consumer prices this scenario could be extremely bullish for scarce and non dilutable forms of haven assets such as precious metals at crescat precious metals are overwhelmingly our preferred hedge against fiat money printing and over valued financial assets it s important to note that cryptocurrencies provide an additional outlet for investors to flee stocks and bonds as well as fiat currencies today and thereby to help make rising inflation in those currencies a self fulfilling prophecy bitcoin is a bet on technology and cryptography as well as a vehicle to disrupt and even circumvent government control over money bitcoin is limited in supply like precious metals and in that sense could be a valuable call option on inflation as the first mover it has the network effect advantage over other cryptocurrencies which are abundant and therefore unlike precious metals as an asset class we believe a small position in bitcoin could provide diversification and hedging with significant upside but we do not advocate for more than one or two percent of a portfolio at this time given its high risk for those living under authoritarian governments with strict capital controls it is important to note that cryptocurrencies provide a functional and disruptive means of escape which plays into our bearish view on the chinese yuan in the wake of the 2008 9 crisis central banks starved investors for yield in attempt to generate new borrowing and spending and thereby grow the economy but in the absence of significant fiscal stimulus to go along with it extraordinary monetary policy mainly served to generate extreme expansion in value of financial assets with only muted economic growth and real world inflation to go along with it monetary stimulus alone thus increased the wealth disparity between the rich who disproportionately own stocks and bonds compared to the more generally debt laden masses it is thus no surprise that today we have a fertile breeding ground for rising populism and nationalism and their financial bubble bursting implications including trade wars and deglobalization we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us repo liquidity crisis a wake up call to china risks when today s plethora of macro imbalances begin to unwind we fully expect that fed intervention will again be necessary to attempt to ease the pain of collapsing asset prices the rehypothecation repo liquidity crisis that we just experienced in september is a new kind of wake up call like in 2008 a freeze up in the interbank credit markets is a sign that a large financial institution somewhere on the planet may be on the brink of collapse the fed indeed has already responded with emergency liquidity injections we can only imagine that a large and wobbling chinese bank is in need of us dollars and has been attempting to pledge treasuries to borrow them perhaps other banks stepped away for fear that those treasuries had already been pledged too many times over and nobody really knows who would get them if the music stopped we are not saying that is what happened in september we don t know what exactly happened the fed has been carefully guarding the true story but it has also continued in emergency qe mode for the last three months what we are saying is that there is indeed substantial financial market risk today because of the truly insane imbalances that have built up inside the chinese banking system based on our macro research we believe the pboc has already more than fully encumbered its foreign exchange reserves in its effort to keep its currency from collapsing to date the recent surprise new money printing from the fed is confirmation that there are indeed real problems beginning to surface in the global capital markets the fed s role to be clear if china s banking imbalances are indeed finally poised to unwind is not to rescue chinese banks rather to rescue the us banks that are their counterparties so while today s us stock market has many parallels to 1929 1972 and 2000 in terms of valuation and downside risk it also has some to parallels to 2008 with the potential for banking liquidity crises in the interbank dollar funding markets we are much less concerned about the risk of an actual collapse of the us banking system today because the fed has proven its willingness and ability to swiftly step in there ultimately we believe combined fiscal and monetary stimulus will be applied in concert to combat the next market and economic downturn we strongly believe that too many investors today are underestimating the future inflationary risk of this high likelihood the problem is the recency bias of the post gfc world where central bank easing failed to generate the inflation that was feared at that time the reason it didn t is that outside of china the accompanying fiscal expansion was absent the chessboard looks much different today the willingness to embrace new monetary and fiscal experiments today is high and they will come at a cost such a political climate is particularly troublesome for stock and bond bulls today because rising inflation would almost certainly be a killer of today s financial asset euphoria if one is going to buy stocks at all in this environment one area that looks extremely attractive with low valuations and improving fundamentals is gold and silver mining stocks many of these companies have low valuations improving growth and strong positive free cash flow already after going through a bear market from 2011 to early 2016 after four years of base building we believe they are poised to take off fundamentally and technically in a soon to be rising gold and silver price environment why crescat many investors are not even aware of the extreme valuations in the financial markets today at this likely critical macro inflection point in the global economy for those who are many are not willing to do very much about it in their portfolios for fear of going against the crowd for those who are willing to do something many today are unwittingly moving toward conventional defensive long positions and thereby are crowding into a different kind of mania such as utility stocks which in reality have a horrific track record of protecting wealth during bear markets and recessions as we show below in the chart below going back to 1929 at crescat we believe we have a better way of investing ahead of a probable downturn in the business cycle across multiple themes in our global macro hedge fund we are expressing what we believe is the macro trade of the century based on our three highest conviction investment themes today long precious metals including mining stocks shorts select overvalued us and global equities and short the china yuan and hong kong dollar through asymmetric risk put options the truth is that not many professional money managers are willing to be significantly short stocks even most hedge funds tend to be net long oriented funds and only rarely attempt to time markets we are not perma bears by any means but are indeed attempting to tactically time the market today based on our macro models and themes given our strong views on the current unprecedented euphoria and abundance of catalysts for an imminent downturn our goal is to grow and protect wealth by capitalizing on the decline we are somewhat unique as a macro fund in that we believe in security selection in addition to broad macro trades for instance we prefer to pick individual equity longs and shorts based on our models to express our themes and generate outperformance alpha rather than just getting index beta exposure we have demonstrated our ability to generate alpha in stocks over time in our large cap and long short strategies furthermore we are value investors which gives us intrepid confidence to hold a portfolio that we believe is worth substantially more or less in the case of our shorts than the market is valuing it at any point in time within the context of our risk model we are willing to ride with the fluctuations in the market s pricing of our positions knowing that is what can also drive significant upside as the true value of our holdings ultimately becomes recognized thus we can be secure in maintaining our substantial us equity net short position today in each of our hedge funds at the same time as a frenzied wall street is trying to squeeze the last juice out of a record overvalued market historically late in the business cycle while oblivious to many of the risks that we see the performance in our hedge funds in q4 of last year and in may and august of this year which we show in the chart below is just a glimpse of what we believe we can achieve when the overall us stock market more fully transitions from bull to bear while we are having a pullback in november to date as the us market pushing marginally to new highs and precious metals are pulling back our us equity shorts have not been hurting us as much as one might think in our hedge funds because many of the stocks we are short have been declining us equity short positions in our maturing expansion theme made money for instance in both funds in september and october even as the overall indices pushed higher this is because the internals of the market have been weakening we think the market s diverging breadth is an important timing signal for the likely near term direction of the overall market which could begin to turn decisively down as soon as december given the holiday later this week investors will need to move on monday and tuesday if they want to add money to our hedge funds ahead of december we think it could be great timing october performance attribution october performance sincerely kevin c smith cfa chief

rupee plunges against dollar business rupee plunges against dollar the world bank group had forecasted pakistan s economic growth to slow down for the next two years 26 november 2019 12 51 pm karachi dunya news the pakistani rupee on tuesday further depreciated against the u s dollar in the interbank market by 8 paisa and hit rs155 37 the local currency in the previous week appreciated against the u s dollar with 10 paisa in the interbank and closed at rs155 27 on friday likewise in the open market traded at rs155 40 against the greenback with slight fluctuation in the whole week earlier the world bank group had forecasted pakistan s economic growth to slow down for the next two years as it continues to face another macroeconomic crisis due to massive twin deficits and low foreign reserves despite significant devaluation the wb still sees the rupee overvalued by the end of september by approximately 4 8 in the last three months the local currency was observed to recover against the greenback in both interbank and open markets analysts had expressed fear that the intense ongoing trade war between the united states and china would result in fluctuation of the u s dollar in the local market and the value of the pakistani rupee would stabilise depending on the measures taken by the government with appropriate economic policies currency traders were of the view that the increasing inflows of remittance have supported the local rupee in the market until june this year the rupee was observed to cumulatively depreciate against the greenback which in turn had resulted in increased prices of goods and hardships for the general public the sbp has let the rupee depreciate significantly in the inter bank market after finalising an agreement with the international monetary fund imf for a loan programme on may 12 the imf asked pakistan to end state control of the rupee and let the currency move freely to find its equilibrium against the us dollar on the other hand the world bank group has also supported the idea of leaving the rupee free from state control in an attempt to give much needed boost to exports and fix a faltering economy after the imf lent the first tranche of 991 4 million to pakistan the local currency had depreciated massively the stringent conditions on which the global moneylender has formally approved the bailout package of 6 billion for pakistan seemed to have exerted more pressure on the local currency the gradual drop in the rupee had come due to high demand for the dollar against thin supply as the country continued to make aggressive international payments to partially pay off huge foreign debt and for imports economists were of the view that effective measures must be implemented on the priority basis to recover the state from the balance of payment deficit besides increased demand of the greenback in the local market they had termed balance of payments deficit as the main reason in the recent hike in the value of the us dollar moreover they had considered that state s exports and investment were required to grow significantly and the imports must be reduced to remove pressure on the local currency according to experts the government must ensure implementations on economic policies after the deal with the imf
by andrew moran the u s dollar has been as good as gold for the last 70 years enjoying its hegemony as the international reserve currency despite the federal reserve destroying the greenback s value over the last 100 years foreign governments central banks and global financial markets have depended on the buck for everything from its status as a safe haven asset to its use in worldwide transactions as the saying goes all good things must come to an end and it might be time to bid farewell to the dollar the war on the dollar in the last several years the world has started to witness an incremental de dollarization push by a handful of nations the process of reducing dollar holdings using local denominations and taking part in currency swaps has become ubiquitous right now it is only america s so called adversaries such as russia iran and china that are leading this movement but the data suggest more states are gradually attempting to dethrone the dollar today the share of dollars held in global reserves has tumbled from 65 3 in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 61 8 in the second quarter of 2019 meanwhile the shares of allocated reserves are becoming more diversified as the euro yuan and yen have attained a greater representation in global reserves major oil producers and some of the world s largest exporters have halted the accumulation of u s debt securities in october 2014 china and russia signed a three year ruble yuan currency swap agreement worth up to 25 billion aimed at increasing trade with these currencies in september 2017 the russian government approved legislation that made the ruble the main currency of exchange at all russian seaports zimbabwe venezuela and iran have either diminished their acceptance of the dollar or have refused it entirely germany has requested a new independent payment system suggesting that it wants alternatives to the buck with iran isolated from the international community a growing number of jurisdictions are getting frustrated because they want to do business with tehran this desire to conduct trade with one of the largest crude producers in the world might motivate governments and central banks to de dollarize says anne korin from the institute for the analysis of global security she told rt last month we don t know what s going to come next but what we do know is that the current situation is unsustainable you have a growing club of countries very powerful countries europe wants to do business with iran it doesn t want to be subject to u s law for doing business with iran right nobody wants to be picked up at an airport for doing business with countries that the u s isn t happy that they re doing business with whatever the case central banks have revealed their consternation as of late according to the world gold council wgc central banks have purchased an all time high of 375 tons of gold this year so far it might only account for one fifth of the total global gold demand but the trend does lead to some interesting speculations for these purchases in the aftermath of the recession these institutions were scooping up bullion to protect themselves from the uncertainty and chaos today they may be preparing for another economic calamity or perhaps they are getting ready for instability that would transpire during the transition away from the dollar will it work a lot of folks from all political persuasions enjoy taking digs at the u s dollar considering the state of the basket of currencies you can only wonder if the de dollarization instigators know what they are getting themselves into it is not as if they are begging for an end to fiat money and a relaunch of gold backed money or free market currency let s be honest compared to other currencies the dollar is sound money the yuan is crumbling the ruble is worthless the canadian dollar is treading water the euro is being systematically destroyed by the european central bank ecb and the australian dollar seems fine where it is on the currency hierarchy you could make the case for the swiss franc to topple the dollar but the issue is that the swiss national bank snb is trying to curtail its immense demand and is debasing the franc international commerce might eventually warm up to an exotic currency dominating trade however people investors consumers and entrepreneurs are resistant to change they like commonality the u s dollar and the euro are successful because of familiarity everyone knows how to trade them it is a lot more difficult to trade with the ruble or other highly volatile currencies it is also important to remember right now that the u s dollar has lost much confidence in financial markets the trade war political turmoil in washington and contentious relationships worldwide the buck has survived quite a bit in the last few years it is why markets called it a teflon dollar even if sen bernie sanders i vt or sen elizabeth warren d ma were to win the 2020 presidential election the world would still be enamored with the dollar should the de dollarization kick into high gear it will still take decades for local currencies to overtake the buck of course a dollar crisis which is quite possible in the not so distant future could speed up the move the national debt has topped 23 trillion the federal government is recording trillion dollar budget deficits and washington faces more than 200 trillion in unfunded liabilities expenditures it is hard to envision the greenback surviving another 50 years bracing for impact as we brace for the dollar s inevitable demise or as we perform an autopsy to find out what happened there will always be a segment of the population that will try to blame one specific person in this case millions of americans will blame president donald trump even if the dollar s evisceration happens in the next 25 50 or 100 years but the slow push away happened before trump and it will continue when he leaves office it has been a collective effort involving the smartest men and women in the white house on capitol hill and within the confines of the eccles building there is no creature from the black lagoon it will be the entire population of the swamp that will have triggered the dollar collapse this was originally published on liberty nation like this article get ecn delivered to your inbox daily subscribe

yves here i m going to have to read this post carefully a couple of times to be able to make a short high level summary but it does confirm one of my i know it s true but i can t prove it theories in this case it s that the fed moving to using interest on reserves as its route for managing interest rates was deeply flawed but worked well enough when the system was awash with liquidity the repo mess is the result of the fed still relying on a mechanism that isn t fit for purpose by edward j kane professor of finance boston college originally published at the institute for new economic thinking website repeat after me how much pipe should fed plumbers lay if fed plumbers like to lay pipe short term money markets seldom make headline news but since mid september one of the most important components of the money market the so called repo market in which traders borrow from each other using securities as collateral has been in almost constant turmoil at one point the market threatened to dry up with borrowers paying rates as high as 10 per annum the question that this paper seeks to answer is why don t us banks temporarily liquidate some or all of their excess reserves at the federal reserve when the repo rate surges so far above the rate they receive for holding on to them asset pricing theory tell us that the answer must lie in a blend of three ideas 1 the way that the risk free interest rate on excess reserves the ioer is being set 2 the extent to which counterparties the marginal repo ers might be experiencing a deterioration in their stand alone default risk and in the quality of the collateral they offer and 3 the price the market sets for bearing these risks at each maturity elementary economic theory interprets the interest rate on collateralized loans as the sum of a riskless rate and a premium paid for accepting both a delay in collectability and the particular risks posed by borrowers and the collateral they offer this paper focuses on the fed s interest rate on excess reserves and how this rate and the fed s upper and lower targets for the fed funds rate distort the term structure of riskless rates the key point is that the maturity of excess reserves is whatever a bank wants it to be paying the same rate for excess reserve balances irrespective of the counterparty bank s planned maturity conflicts with the idea that the term structure for riskless rates should depend in part on expectations of future economic developments forecasting these developments cannot be done with any accuracy in this very uncertain world setting a single ioer irrespective of maturity distorts the yield curve for risk bearing in that it is likely to subsidize risk avoidance at most horizons in a word the value of the option to let excess reserve balances ride needs to be priced explicitly plumbing financial liquidity liquidity is a three dimensional term a dealer market is said to be liquid when one can either establish or liquidate a substantial position quickly at little cost and without having much impact on the price of the asset exchanged in targeting financial stability federal reserve officials concern themselves directly with two kinds of liquidity the liquidity of bank portfolios and the liquidity of markets for overnight funds since they characterize their stabilization efforts as providing liquidity it is natural to think of fed officials as operating a combined fresh water and waste water treatment facility its reservoirs pumps and pipes contribute to the circulation of explicit liquidity and hard to observe implicit subsidies both products are piped through selected banks and securities dealers oversight of how fairly and efficiently the fed s directly connected banks and dealer firms retail these products to downstream businesses and households represents a poorly understood third product line in recent weeks clogs have developed in two closely related markets for overnight funds in one of these markets the fed makes collateralized loans directly to eligible firms because title to the collateral temporarily changes hands these loans are called repurchase agreements or repos the other market trades titles to reserve balances held at the fed because the balances traded never leave the books of the fed tradeable claims to the balances are known as federal or fed funds because the fed usually prices its delicately plumbed products favorably it is a privilege for a private financial firm to be allowed to connect some or all of its retail pipes and pumps directly to the fed eisenbeis 2018 indicates that the fed s most important counterparties are money market funds who participate only in the repurchase agreement part of the network and 23 securities firms it designates as primary dealers primary dealers are connected not only to the repo network but they participate as well in the fed s daily open market operations and in securities auctions that the fed administers on behalf of the treasury more than half of designated dealers are subsidiaries of foreign institutions the opportunity to trade directly with the fed conveys to these firms a limited amount of pricing power and a corresponding duty to help the fed to avoid and service clogs in their downstream distribution systems my metaphor for the network the fed has built for distributing permanent and overnight liquidity raises at least three issues about the post crisis banking scene first why are contingent safety net guarantees and interest on excess reserves still being subsidized and shouldn t well off bankers especially those domiciled in europe feel morally queasy about extracting subsidies from lower income us taxpayers second why aren t the fed s charges for overnight liquidity characterized as deliberately underpriced fees paid for a temporary splash of liquidity rather than being framed less transparently as if they were interest payments on a collateralized loan third should fed officials feel an obligation to re pipe its subsidy network to minimize the daily volatility of the explicit and implicit elements of the federal funds rate managing the liquidity in fed reservoirs paying explicit interest on excessreserves whenever the fed releases some liquidity from its reservoirs it flows through commercial bank reserve accounts as excess reserves figure 1 shows that in the 25 years leading up to the gfc banks did not allow excess reserves to stay on their balance sheets for very long this is because the explicit return on these assets was zero and in most circumstances their implicit return was low as well this miniscule return led policymakers to expect that bankers would put reserve inflows to work in new loans and investments more or less as soon as they could economists have used this expectation of prompt bank recirculation to build a simplified dynamic model of the money creation process in this model pumping a given amount of reserves into or out of the hands of profit maximizing bankers shifts the supply of loanable funds to the right left the more elastic the demand for these funds the larger the equilibrium change in the money supply everyone agrees that the usefulness of this theory broke down during the great depression but it is not easy to divide responsibility for this breakdown between customers reluctance to borrow and bankers reluctance to lend it is also hard to get professionals in any field to abandon an established theory as the great depression became an ever more distant memory economists found it easier and easier to convince themselves that the problem during the 1930s lay not just in a drastic fall off in loanable funds demand but in the timid way that fed officials supplied new reserves outside the fed the money multiplier theory was rescued from the scrap heap by adding the assumption that when the economy is in crisis central bankers have to have the courage to drive the level of excess reserves to great heights to be effective these new levels need to be high enough to spur insolvent and nearly insolvent banks into making loans at historically low rates of return in an extremely uncertain environment it seems clear that managers of zombie institutions find it useful to show an inordinate amount of excess reserves on their balance sheets whenever a bank s earnings opportunities and asset values crash excess reserves gain value in two ways they reduce the near term probability of having to face either a bank examination or a destructive customer run during the crisis helping distressed banks to build up liquidity became a major goal of the fed the fed made aggressive use of its discount window and emergency lending authority to pump liquidity directly into banks whose balance sheets were running dry the explosion of creatively named fed programs for lending to troubled institutions supports the hypothesis that establishing a reserve abundant environment became temporarily an intermediate crisis management target new loans made in this environment might actually lower a bank s reported rate of return on its particular blend of fairly priced new assets and deliberately overvalued old assets to buy time for various endgame gambles for resurrection to play out zombie bankers have to put up numbers that falsely convey the impression that they could withstand either a run or a rigorous federal bank examination inside the fed the expansion of excess reserves has been framed in terms of targets for interest rates securities prices and the flow of new mortgage loans nevertheless figure 1 shows that during the great financial crisis the modern fed seemed to confirm the lender reluctance hypothesis by pumping out to its dismay almost three trillions of dollars in excess reserves during this experiment contrary actions taken in enhancing explicit returns on excess reserves and reallocating supervisory resources blurred the results of the exercise stepping up the number of bank examinations conducted each week and finding and closing insolvent banks at the rate of 3 per week figure 2 made excess reserves more valuable than ever as in the nineteen thirties weak and insolvent banks whose priorities were avoiding and surviving bank examinations and customer runs took their sweet time in putting excess reserves into play explicit interest on excess reserves shortly after lehman failed in 2008 the fed sought and received congressional permission to accelerate the date of its previously authorized ability to pay explicit interest on bank reserves wall 2015 characterizes the fed s request as part of a plan meant to set a floor on interest rates that would prepare federal funds traders for a return to an environment of scarce reserves and to the system for trading these reserves that went with it when income employment and credit demand finally began to pick up steam the fed s liquidity distribution metaphor reframed the crisis driven buildup of excess reserves going forward as an overfilled reservoir of bank liquidity this way of thinking led fed officials to worry excessively about the inflationary consequences of a possible flood of liquidity as banks return to solvency destroyed their need to hold onto excess reserves as a screening device to slow the release of liquidity from reserve accounts during the post crisis era fed policies encouraged banks explicitly and implicitly to release excess reserve balances cautiously in view of 1 banks legacy of unbooked losses 2 the high rate of ongoing bank closures and 3 the slow recovery of customer demand for bank funding it is doubtful that quite so much encouragement was needed but fear of being blamed for initiating a new round of high inflation and a concern for the survival of almost solvent banks in the system made it seem reasonable for fed officials to step up the role of explicit interest on reserves from the fed s earliest days the costs and benefits of requiring banks to hold reserves was a point of contention between the fed and the banks for many years the fed softened the burden of reserve requirements by offering its member banks a series of clearing settlement currency and safe keeping services that were not fully priced it is useful to interpret this pricing scheme as a form of implicit interest on members reserve balances in the 1980s lobbying pressure from large banks that competed with the fed in the market for interbank services persuaded congress to pass legislation that increasingly restricted the fed s ability to underprice its services see kane 1982 to limit opportunities for banks to escape reserve requirements by surrendering their memberships in the fed congress tried to balance the bargain by extending the reach of federal reserve requirements to nonmember banks but other kinds of regulatory arbitrage continued to undercut the effectiveness of these requirements this is how fed officials came to look for new ways to influence aggregate reserves and eventually to support the idea of paying explicit interest on reserves held at the fed in the midst of the banking crisis in late 2008 the fed was permitted to pay explicit interest as an emergency measure to make the rate on these balances into a more powerful crisis management tool fed leaders decided to accrue interest on required and excess reserve balances alike paying banks explicit interest on balances held in excess of the amount that is legally required is equivalent to creating for banks only a treasury bill whose maturity is at the option of the holder variation in the level of the rate which banks receive on these excess reserves has gone on to become along with the rates the fed offers on repurchase agreements a lead instrument in the fed s tool cabinet early in the crisis the fed funds rate sank to a near zero level so that the higher return offered on excess reserves began to pump a larger and larger flow of subsidies to banks that chose not to dump their reserves into the market the resulting decline in reserve circulation persuaded fed officials to revitalize the instrument of open market operations they christened the one way transactions that fighting the great financial crisis entailed first as large scale asset purchases but journalists and traders renamed the program more colorfully as quantitative easing quantitative easing which became qe in fedspeak pushed policymakers into a scheme that resembles a reverse version of paul volcker s 1979 targeting scheme fueling the pumps for large open market purchases entailed 1 allowing mortgage backed securities issued by fannie and freddie to enter into the range of securities purchased in fed open market operations and 2 expanding what had begun as a roughly one trillion dollar securities portfolio by over 3 5 trillion dollars the main method fed officials used to restore bank solvency was to subsidize the return that could be earned on excess reserves although fed officials deny that this was their intention the idea of paying interest on required reserves at the level of their opportunity costs has a distinguished intellectual pedigree and a legitimate policy purpose wall 2017 but their search for new controls in the midst of a crisis led fed leaders to blow past the opportunity cost restriction because the ioer is meant to be available only to fdic insured banks fed officials felt free to allow the market equilibrium fed funds rate to lie below the return on excess reserves sometimes for days on end this policy turned the rate paid on excess reserves into a subsidized and inherently discriminatoryinstrument one of the principal themes of my research has been to show that discriminatory policy instruments generate creative forms of circumvention that eventually destroy the policy s discriminatory effect so it is with the ioer to allow large nonbank institutions and accredited i e wealthy household investors to earn the excess reserve rate minus a small fee several ex fed employees chartered a controversial narrow and uninsured bank tnb usa inc in connecticut a narrow bank is one that takes no risk the social value of such a bank was originally framed as a hypothetical way to eliminate the need for a government safety net but until an explicit return on excess reserves emerged no risk meant no profit because narrow banks could never earn enough on safe assets to be viable the fed has so far refused to give tnb a reserve account i suppose on the grounds 1 that tnb is not and cannot become an insured bank because its charter does not allow it to accept retail deposits and 2 that tnb s only purpose for existence is to circumvent a particular fed rule as in other cases of blatant regulatory arbitrage the legality of this scheme will finally be settled in the courts it doesn t take much imagination to see that if nonbank parties are willing to pay a fee to tnb to get a piece of the return offered on excess reserves the return on excess reserves is out of line with other short term rates the best justification for subsidizing returns on excess reserves is to prevent a rapid monetization of excess reserves but the level of subsidization is itself generating arbitrage activity that transforms other types of short term funding into higher rate excess reserves authorities need to understand that creative regulatory arbitrage won t stop with tnb innovative arrangements will keep coming until the subsidy the ioer conveys is effectively eliminated the root of the problem is that fed officials are simultaneously trying to unwind qe and to align four closely related explicit rates and fees its discount rate the corridor of upper and lower target rates it sets for fed funds and the return on excess returns administered target rates move once in a while but market rates on similar assets and liabilities move continually as market rates fluctuate some fed administered target rates become too high and others become too low both in the us and abroad it is the job of savvy financial engineers to plow through this wave of closely related opportunities to garner handsome minute to minute returns on short term balances such creative arbitrageurs routinely search out minor differences in explicit and implicit interest rates on various instruments to generate profits on rewarding trades of their devising chairman powell has characterized such arbitrage as a technical issue miller and matthews 2019 but it is much more than that it seems clear that the setting the ioer too high during and after the great financial crisis has had important macroeconomic consequences it made holding excess reserves attractive enough to render the private supply of federal funds less elastic elementary price theory tells us that given an unchanged environment of seasonal daily and intraday shifts in the demand for liquidity this decrease in the elasticity of supply should increase the volatility of the fed funds rate bank portfolio theory has even more to say subsidizing bank holdings of excess reserves tempts american offices of foreign banks to raise funds in negative interest rate european environments and put them to work as excess reserves at the fed this arbitrage is helping to keep a number of foreign zombie banks alive at our expense at the same time the availability of long lasting subsidies must also be expected to alter the domestic financial industry s equilibrium portfolio too reducing interbank lending and loans to business and households in the process the increase in the volatility of the repo and fed funds rates have further incentivized a number of important banks to repurpose their reserve management staffs as arbitrage traders in short term contracts of all sorts figure 3 shows that since mid 2018 jpmorgan in particular has been selling off loans and increasing its holdings of directly tradable securities while armstrong portrays this shift as an effort to arbitrage differences in capital requirements on loans and securities i think the greater usefulness of securities as collateral in other forms of regulatory arbitrage is more important in the face of a doubling in the size of major us financial markets his graph shows that banks explicit revenue from trading has been falling given that a doubling has been observed in bank stock prices it is likely that clever accountants see to it that returns from regulatory arbitrage trading accrue in accounts with less informative names a prolonged difference between the fed funds rate and the sum of 1 the excess reserve rate and 2 the option value of being able to move funds almost costlessly between excess reserves and other opportunities is by no means a technical issue this gap disrupts the risk structure of bank returns by establishing for banks only an unusually high rate of return on a risk free opportunity i have no doubt that the availability of this outsized daily return has retarded bank financed economic growth during the post crisis era fed officials deliberately set too high a floor on the yield banks could earn by holding ultrasafe and optional maturity excess reserves this made it possible for more than a few us banks to wait out the post recovery period of painfully low interest rates and feeble and uncertain loan demand besides distorting the domestic price of risk bearing the gap between the ioer and negative interest rates in europe and japan set up carry trades that were and still are being exploited by foreign institutions and domestic money market mutual funds since the fed could stop this exploitation if they wanted to by eliminating the explicit return on excessreserves one has to conclude that fed officials believe that supporting zombie banks in foreign lands benefits us interests how does the sum of explicit and implicit interest collected on an overnight basis differ from a simple fee for the use of one day funds the short answer to the question posed in the section heading is that there is no substantive difference between a simple fee and a one time payment no matter how the amount due might be calculated a fee is a payment made for a professional or public service fees are typically paid in the coin of the realm framing a one day fee as a per annum interest rate attaches unnecessary emotional significance to the volatility observed when it changes for example a 10 percentage point move which might quadruple the repo rate on a given day translates in dollar terms into a fee increase of only 0 10 360 1 3 600 though the increases in either measure are proportionately the same the emotional contexts differ an increase of 0 27 pennies in a per dollar fee does not trigger age old concerns that make the increase seem usurious a second advantage of looking at the price of overnight funds as a fee is that it leads us to think of the trouble of finding evaluating securing and returning collateral as an unavoidable additional and implicit fee characterizing movements in the cost of a repo transaction solely in terms of an explicit repo rate fails to acknowledge the ways that explicit and implicit fees substitute for each other a temporary shortage of easy to transfer collateral should persuade private lenders both to accept and to price explicitly an equilibrium increase in collateral risk a reduction in the average quality of the collateral a counterparty can offer may be expected to call for an increase in the explicit fee charged for the funds allowing borrowers to post a less secure type of collateral increases the explicit rate on repos but reduces the unobserved implicit fee that borrowers would have incurred if they had been forced to post higher quality collateral qe has left the fed holding trillions of dollars of treasury securities that it is reluctant either to cancel or to sell off quickly these assets could allow the fed to reduce spikes in the equilibrium collateral quality costs that banks experience simply by developing programs for lending out i e repo ing high quality items from its securities portfolio since mid september 2019 fed officials have taken pride in doing the opposite of that because the fed acts as the counterparty to the repo writer its position deserves to be called a reverse repo in response to surges in the explicit overnight repo rate fed officials have written reverse repos that have absorbed as much as 100 billion in high quality collateral on a single day derby 2019 they have also proposed to lay down a new layer of reverse repo piping in the form of a permanent facility for engaging in term i e longer than one day reverse repos dizard 2019 although the public has been encouraged to think of these new pipes as serving as a vital liquidity lifeline the fed ought to look for ways to provide liquidity in ways that do not layer microeconomic problems on top of macroeconomic ones bankers and fed officials have offered no evidence that risk based volatility in the fee charged for overnight funding threatens the life of healthy banks or enhances the welfare of society in a specified way without evidence that the risks of these transactions are being mispriced it is premature for policymakers and their client megabanks to think that taxpayers need to hand the fed yet another instrument with which to subsidize the financial sector why are megabankers and fed officials so concerned with movements in the explicit part of overnight repo fees anyway although spokespersons have portrayed spikes in the fed funds rate as evidence of a market failure it is more likely a consequence of surges in the default and information risks generated by the changing transparency and financial strength of repo and federal funds traders especially foreign ones taxpayers deserve to know who would actually benefit from further subsidizing private traders and who would be made to bear the costs subsidizing the banking system in this additional way opens up new avenues of regulatory arbitrage and makes no economic sense unless one can identify a corresponding benefit to customers and ordinary taxpayers i doubt that a less elitist government would see a need to invent yet another way to run subsidies through the fed s plumbing system this episode seems little more than an updated case of the fed s age old susceptibility to regulatory capture and money market myopia in popularizing the latter term karl brunner used to add that the fed is always looking to add one more key to its already vast instrumental policy keyboard but it is important to ask how this new facility might differ from the fed s age old discount rate and discount window the main differences would seem to involve a change in the policy narratives that a new facility can accommodate fed policymakers rather than individual banks would initiate these deals this means that that little so called stigma would attach to banks that use the new facility to borrow from the fed the fed would also seem to control the maximum amount and collateralized character of the funds that could move through the new facility at any time but the discount window and discount rate would still exist i have always thought of the stigma attached to using the discount window as merely another of the fed s many policy instruments we should not forget that the stigma originated as an implicit surcharge invented to discourage interest rate arbitrage in the 1950s and 1960s see goldfeld and kane 1966 today the stigma is nearing the end of its useful life expanding the fed s reverse repo keyboard seems less efficient than building connections into technology driven new forms of banking and reframing the stigma as a counterproductive vestige of a slower moving financial past wall 2011 explains that fannie and freddie and federal home loan banks as well were routinely selling federal funds because they could not themselves legally earn interest on their reserve balances at the fed at rates below the reserves rate to banks who could re post the same funds as interest bearing reserves this activity helped to drive the funds rate below the fed s announced target but the fed chose not to take countervailing action retail deposits are defined as deposits made by individuals who are not accredited investors under federal securities regulations a narrow bank takes deposits and invests only in super safe assets i would add that avoiding the assessment fees that the fdic levies on the assets of insured banks plays a critical part in tnb s business model and in reducing the profitability of domestic us banks efforts to arbitrage differences between the funds rate and the reserves rate wall 2015 of course the fed s open market desk could easily control this volatility directly by engaging in repos throughout the trading day since these securities are intragovernmental debt cancellation would affect fed earnings and net worth but have no direct effect on bank reserves if accountants can help banks to offset actual losses by creating intangible phantom capital accounts such as deferred tax assets and core deposit intangibles they can invent similar accounts for the fed the simplest approach would be to plug in an intangible value for its franchise
whether we are talking about trade and investment or banking and payments stablecoins and the technology underlying them will be the building blocks of a more sustainable inclusive and resilient global financial system this will require not only interoperability across blockchains but also interoperability between fiat cash and digital currencies and between centralized and decentralized systems what is a stablecoin a stablecoin is a cryptographically signed digital asset recorded on a blockchain usually backed by some real world asset such as a fiat currency or commodity this is intended to provide price stability so that the stablecoin can be used as a digital store of value and or medium of exchange global financial imbalance one of the major ways in which stablecoins could contribute towards a more resilient global economy is by tempering some of the potential threats posed by the us dollar s usd domination of global foreign currency reserves stablecoins could make the global economy a little more well stable image howmuch net the international monetary fund foreign currency reserves are often accumulated by countries through trade and play an important role for central banks in stabilizing the value of their national currency according to the imf the us dollar usd accounted for 62 of all foreign reserves held by central banks in the first quarter of 2019 while us gdp accounted for 15 of global gdp usd reserves are usually held by central banks in the form of us government bonds and are thus removed from circulation this relentless flow of usd into us government bonds has kept us interest rates lower for longer and pushed the country s debt and gdp to levels not seen since the second world war a global scarcity of usd creates major headwinds for us exporters widening the trade deficit and pressuring economic growth as we saw during the 2008 global financial crisis a major political or economic disturbance can drive investors headlong into usd denominated safe assets and create a global liquidity crunch without another massive round of quantitative easing a flight into usd could quickly drain remaining global liquidity and cause cascading effects across the global financial system diversified digital reserve currencies in august 2019 bank of england governor mark carney gave a speech at a gathering of central bankers in jackson hole wyoming he argued for reducing global reliance on the usd as the international reserve currency by creating a global digital reserve asset backed by a basket of leading currencies including the usd the euro the british pound and the yen according to carney a diversified digital currency one only partially weighted in usd could unlock dollar funds stockpiled by governments and help increase global liquidity trade and investment it turns out that a framework for a diversified international reserve currency has been around for 50 years in the form of the imf s special drawing right sdr the sdr s value is maintained as a weighted combination of the world s leading currencies loading digital cash and financial inclusion in addition to diversifying sources of global liquidity and helping to balance trade flows stablecoins could also boost financial inclusion by reducing the global poor s dependence on physical cash one in three adults worldwide does not have a bank account most of whom live on a few dollars per day and do not meet minimum account balance requirements this problem is compounded by the limited reach of physical banking infrastructure around the world holding managing and transacting in cash imposes significant logistical financial and security burdens on the unbanked even when bank accounts are opened minimum account balances are held and transaction activity is kept to a minimum to avoid incurring banking fees for most banks the world s 1 7 billion unbanked adults are not the highest priority the billions more who are underbanked might hold a minimum account balance but continue to rely on cash for transactions minimum account balances and limited transaction data combined with personal income volatility mean most banks simply do not have enough data to provide financial services to lower income account holders this is not just a developing world problem according to a 2017 survey by the federal deposit insurance corporation 25 of us households more than 50 million adults are unbanked or underbanked in the developing world banks usually have limited access to credit reporting services and often require higher levels of collateral and higher interest rates to hedge against lending uncertainty to tackle this global credit gap a wave of fintechs have emerged that analyze clues from a prospective borrower s digital footprint to forecast expected volatility and the likelihood of repayment stablecoins could expand the reach of consumer and small business credit across borders by reducing exposure to foreign exchange risk and the high fees associated with international payment networks revolutionizing remittances international remittances are the single largest source of external financing for many of the world s low and middle income countries international remittance typically involves an archaic patchwork of correspondent banks post offices and money transfer agents that usually pocket 7 10 of the total value of each transaction international remittances using stablecoins and their distributed ledgers could eliminate the need for costly intermediaries allowing for lower fees and immediate settlement reducing remittance transaction costs to 3 by 2030 is a target under sustainable development goal 10 and if successful could constitute what would be in effect a huge tax cut for the world s poor stablecoins blockchains and interoperability to date there are over 200 stablecoins operating across a number of different blockchains and protocols private organizations have led the way in launching stablecoins with usd backed coins like tether usdcoin and gemini dollar the most active some governments are catching up including dubai with emcash singapore with ubin and the people s bank of china with digital currency electronic payment dcep project perhaps the best known of all stablecoins is one that has not even launched in june 2019 facebook announced the creation of the libra association which would sometime in 2020 launch a new global currency and financial infrastructure to empower billions of people with the 2 7 billion active monthly users across facebook s platforms libra stands out from the hundreds of other stablecoin projects for the speed with which it could reach global scale as a payment system

since at least 2016 the divide between the working class and the elite has been considered a defining issue in american and western politics this divide has been defined in occupational terms blue collar versus information workers geographic terms rural and exurban regions versus major urban cores and meritocratic terms non college educated versus those with elite credentials oc casionally it is given an explicitly moral connotation somewheres versus anywheres deplorables versus cosmopolitans all of these glosses effectively track basic economic categories those who are seen to have enjoyed success in recent decades and those who have been left behind like most clichés this one contains elements of truth the work ing class has experienced economic stagnation and precarity and even declining life expectancy in the united states as well as lower family stability and civic engagement social mobility has declined while inequality has widened but it is precisely for these reasons that the working class is unlikely to be decisive in shaping politics for the foreseeable future however one defines the working class it has scarcely any political agency in the current system and no apparent means for acquiring any at most working class voters can cast their ballots for an un acceptable candidate but they can exercise no influence on policy formation or agency personnel much less on governance areas that have been transferred to technocratic bodies in countries like france the working class might still be able to veto certain policies through public demonstrations but such actions seem unlikely in the united states and even the most heroic efforts of this kind show little prospect of achieving systemic reforms for regimes that style themselves liberal democracies this situation might be disconcerting yet it has persisted for some time the policy agenda that brought about the political and economic marginalization of the working class was adopted between the 1970s and the early 2000s a more organized working class was unable to stop it then it is difficult to imagine a weakened working class reversing it now while a restive working class might provide fertile ground for po litical upheavals any fundamental transformation of western politics will necessarily be led by increasing numbers of the elite who defect from the dominant policy consensus and rethink their allegiance to establishment paradigms conventional narratives including many that are critical of the status quo paint the elite as a unified block aligned with neoliberalism but the neoliberal economy has created a profound fracture within the elite the significance of which is just beginning to be felt the socioeconomic divide that will determine the future of poli tics particularly in the united states is not between the top 30 per cent or 10 percent and the rest nor even between the 1 percent and the 99 percent the real class war is between the 0 1 percent and at most the 10 percent or more precisely between elites primarily dependent on capital gains and those primarily dependent on profes sional labor the last few years have brought about a new discovery of working class immiseration a media phenomenon arguably pro voked by renewed elite anxieties as a result the story of a declining working class is now broadly understood it is after all decades old and it was entirely predictable if not exactly intended much less understood however is the more recent reshaping and radicalization of the professional managerial class while the top 5 or 10 percent may not deserve public sympathy their underperformance relative to the top 0 1 percent will be more politically significant than the hol lowing out of the working or lower middle classes unlike the work ing class the professional managerial class is still capable of and re quired for wielding political power at bottom the economy that has been constructed over the last few decades is nothing more than a capital accumulation economy as long as returns on capital exceed returns on labor then the largest capital holders benefit the most inequality rises and wealth becomes more and more narrowly concentrated 1 labor including elite la bor is inevitably left behind marxian thinkers have been analyzing these dynamics for almost two centuries but they have often misread the political effects of these developments which play out primarily among the elite managerial class rather than within the binary of capitalists and proletarians the forgotten managers discussions of stagnant wage growth for nonmanagerial workers since the 1970s have become commonplace over the last few years along with the story of hardening socioeconomic divides 2 the 9 9 percent is the new american aristocracy as one atlantic headline put it 3 yet what is happening within the 9 9 percent has received little scrutiny in fact the fortunes of the members of this new aristocra cy have diverged considerably the performance gap between the top 1 or 0 1 percent versus the top 10 percent is actually larger than the gap between those right at 10 percent and any part of the bottom 90 percent members of the top 5 or 10 percent have done better than the middle and working classes in recent decades but this masks their dramatic underperformance relative to the top 1 percent and espe cially the top 0 1 percent since 1979 the real annual earnings growth of the top 1 percent has more than tripled that of earners at 10 percent while growth for the 0 1 percent is in turn more than twice that of the 1 percent the picture is even darker when the elite category is expanded senator ben sasse for example drawing on robert putnam has defined the mobile educated elite as the top 31 percent 4 but the top 1 percent has left the rest of this group far behind according to the congressional budget office income grew 226 percent after taxes and transfers from 1979 to 2016 for the top 1 percent but only 79 percent for the next 19 percent of americans and significantly less 47 percent for the middle 60 percent 5 whatever their cultural aspi rations the economic trajectory of someone at 31 percent is closer to that of the 61 percent than the 1 percent in addition the year 2000 represented something of an inflection point for high earners just as chinese accession to the wto around that time was a tipping point for manufacturing workers after 2000 growth began to slow for all income groups though massive inequality persisted by contrast from 1980 to 2000 incomes were growing at a healthy pace throughout the top 10 percent whatever the benefits of neoliberalism might have been they were exhausted for all but the largest capital holders by 2000 lost amid the celebrations of the information economy in recent decades is the fact that elite career trajectories are no longer what they used to be the performance gap of elites versus the working and middle classes has widened but professionals outside the very top are unlikely to match the wealth accumulation of their parents big law for example has recovered from the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis when articles proclaiming the death of that business model were being written every week 6 but the sector has still undergone some lasting structural austerity particularly at the associate level and remains far from its golden age 7 associate salaries at white shoe firms for example remained flat from 2007 to 2016 8 they began rising during the last two years but analysts are already seeing industry demand slowing again 9 finance is another sector that no longer delivers for the top 5 percent like it once did even though firm profits are high at gold man sachs according to bloomberg compensation per employee is down 61 when adjusted for nominal wage growth in the period 10 some of this decline is related to goldman s move into retail banking but not all of it traders have been the worst hit as trading isn t what it used to be noted an analyst quoted in the bloomberg report average compensation for mid level employees in sales and trading has fallen by about half while investment banker salaries have been reduced by about one third 11 outside of the banks hedge fund returns have been disappointing for decades of the thousands of funds that exist today no more than a handful have any reason to exist accordingly fees have been falling across the industry for several years 12 typical employees can enjoy a comfortable lifestyle to be sure but they are unlikely to accumulate substantial capital themselves certainly nothing equivalent to what their counterparts in the 1980s and 90s achieved even at the very top the latest generation of celebrity managers such as bill ackman da vid einhorn and dan loeb have mostly fallen flat they will never match the records of the older generation of stars who got their start in the reagan era though many of these managers have also sput tered private equity is comparatively healthier but it has become highly competitive and increasingly reliant on financial engineering gimmicks such as selling companies between funds managed by the same firm 13 in short the effects of financialization on the real econ omy are being replicated within the industry itself the upward redistribution of rents within a context of overall deceleration silicon valley meanwhile continues to be seen as the brightest star in the new economy universe for founders and venture capitalists it would be difficult to imagine a better system for minting billionaires even if today s most celebrated start ups like uber and wework increasingly look like attempts to subsidize revenue growth at a loss in order to pursue monopoly rents although with dubious prospects 14 but the valley has never been particularly fertile for the salaried professionals and engineers hired by these companies who even now generally make less than their counterparts on wall street or in big law kindergarten playroom office spaces and other exag gerated perks often serve to distract employees from this harsh reali ty 15 the median salary for u s it workers who frequently must live in high priced urban areas is only 81 000 16 moreover increasing numbers of engineers even at the most prestigious companies are hired on temporary contracts when the artificial growth model stalls employees can expect mass layoffs anti hierarchy propaganda not withstanding companies like uber and wework are the most prominent cases recently but employees at many oft hyped tech companies report surprisingly high anxiety about job security more than 70 percent of tesla ebay and snapchat employees said they were afraid of being laid off according to one survey released this year 17 other professionals often fare worse many positions that require advanced degrees large student loans and living in expensive cities barely pay 100 000 a year the streets of cambridge massachusetts are filled with large numbers of scientists with doctorates from pres tigious universities working at top biotech firms or research institutes but living seven to a house with little hope of accumulating savings the career prospects of journalists and academics ironic casualties of the information economy are declining even more relentlessly when members of these professions write about embittered working class trump supporters in declining industries they may as well be writing about themselves indeed the conspicuous embrace of elite values by journalists and academics is often little more than an aspi rational attempt to remain connected to an economically distant elite just as educated millennials conspicuous consumption of ex periences often serves as a necessary distraction from the grim reality that most will never be able to own a home the rising costs of elite membership meanwhile the costs of maintaining elite status and passing it on to one s children have risen disproportionately for the top 5 or 10 percent the ongoing decline of the middle and working classes may have reinforced the top 10 percent s sense of elite status but it also means that any backsliding would be catastrophic these pressures have converged in two key areas in particular real estate and education the narrowing of economic opportunity into a smaller number of sectors and geographies partly due to deindustrialization has result ed in a clustering of elites into a handful of superzips even among those who have managed to do well in the heartland their children will most likely leave for new york san francisco or a handful of other cities they often have to in order to achieve the same earning potential as their parents real estate prices in these areas have risen accordingly a study by the brookings institution showed that the median income rose by 26 percent in san francisco from 2008 to 2016 but rents more than doubled during the same period 18 because of rising real estate costs households earning in the top 25 percent nationally are actually classified as low income in san francisco the household low income threshold in the golden gate city is now approximately 117 000 19 by comparison a household needs to earn about 100 000 to make it into the top 31 percent nationally the national top 10 percent household income threshold is approximately 178 000 20 in addition to deindustrialization and sectoral clustering financialization and rising intra elite inequality added further pressure the immediate effect of global oligarchs buying investment properties and pieds à terre in prime urban areas was to price out professional elites these displaced elites then began gentrifying working class and mid dle class neighborhoods an entire creative class ideology was constructed to explain this phenomenon but its intensity simply concealed the desperation of second tier elites to assuage their status anxiety in reality they simply could not afford to live in the areas where people of their status used to live just like the working class people whom they were in turn pushing out even further on the other hand in areas that were casualties of deindustrialization many elite neighborhoods steadily declined at the same time the costs of passing elite status onto one s children elite education rose rapidly between 1973 and 2013 tui tion costs rose faster than even the 1 percent s income growth and more than twice the rate of the top 5 or 10 percent s income growth 21 the 2019 varsity blues college admissions scandal offers a unique window into the pressures that educational credentialing is creating even at the top levels of the elite the scandal involved a number of wealthy parents bribing college coaches to get their chil dren into prestigious universities through athletic recruiting along with fraudulent test scores the orchestrator of the scheme described the process as a side door in contrast to the front door students getting in on their own and the back door families making large donations to the university 22 it should surprise no one of course that elites are using their wealth to allow their children to cut to the front of the line american meritocracy has been a sham for a long time rather what is new about this scandal is the fact that a former ceo of pimco a managing partner and founder of tpg capital and the cochairman of willkie farr and gallagher felt compelled to use the side door presumably because they could not afford the back door whatever else the scandal says about elite universities circa 2019 it reveals the seedy depths of intra elite inequality and competition moreover while the costs of education have risen since 2000 the rewards have been declining during the 1990s the wage premium for college education grew significantly from 2000 to 2014 however wages for young college graduates actually fell 23 in recent quarters wages for lower income workers are growing faster 24 these trends combined with real estate trends have led to more college graduates 28 percent living with their parents than ever before 25 the numbers are around 40 percent in new york and los angeles upper middle class american radicals since 2000 the combination of stagnation widening inequality and the increasing cost of maintaining elite status has arguably had a more pronounced impact on the professional elite than on the working class which was already largely marginalized by that point elites outside of the very top found themselves falling further behind their supposed cultural peers without being able to look forward to rapid ly rising incomes for themselves this underappreciated reality at least partially explains one of the apparent puzzles of american politics in recent years namely that members of the elite often seem far more radical than the working class both in their candidate choices and overall outlook although better off than the working class lower level elites appear to be experiencing far more intense status anxiety the election of alexandria ocasio cortez a member of the dem ocratic socialists of america dsa to congress offers a clear de monstration of this her strongest support came from comparatively affluent gentrifying neighborhoods 26 her opponent the establishment democrat joe crowley did better in poorer areas likewise there is more socialist organizing in silicon valley27 and elite college campuses today than in working class exurbs eliza beth warren outpolls the comparative moderate joe biden by nearly two to one among voters with college degrees and among voters earning over 100 000 per year 28 bernie sanders is near the top in both categories as well many of the most aggressive proposals associated with the left such as student loan forgiveness and free college are targeted at the top 30 percent if not higher even medicare for all could potentially benefit households earning be tween 100 000 and 200 000 the most cohorts below that are already subsidized moreover as matthew yglesias has pointed out in the past five years white liberals have moved so far to the left on ques tions of race and racism that they are now on these issues to the left of even the typical black voter 29 identity issues are often considered separate from economics yet economic anxieties are almost certainly contributing to these trends among white liberal professionals what ever the underlying merits of woke critiques and causes might be these postures are mainly adopted in intra elite competition for posi tions and influence the personal trajectory of elizabeth warren an avatar of this class in many ways almost perfectly represents the political trajectory of the professional class first they abandoned the republican party and then continued to move further into the left wing of the democratic party warren in fact is one of the few members of the professional elite to display anything close to what might be called class consciousness her 2004 book the two income trap focused mainly on the increasing pressures faced by middle class households and her policy remedies have grown progressively more ambitious since then these shifts have been accelerated among younger generations who never enjoyed the decades of growth for elites before 2000 the recent leftward movement of the upper middle class recalls the rightward drift that occurred in the 1970s and 80s this previous movement was arguably more decisive politically than any awakening of the infamous middle american radicals political priorities are almost always set by the affluent after all and could also be inter preted as a response to changing economic circumstances for the professional class in david t bazelon s formulation the shift to supply side republicans and neoliberal democrats represented a new strategy for the professional elite as barbara ehrenreich described it by the seventies middle class opportunities in domestic gov ernment and academia were shrinking the war on vietnam had swallowed up the war on poverty the incipient tax revolt threatened future federal activism economic stagflation and the oil crisis seemed to herald an age of limits making up imagi nary social problems and appointing themselves to solve them which is what the neoconservatives now accused the new class of having done in the sixties would no longer have worked anyway budgets were shrinking for antipoverty programs and for the cadre of planners who were supposed to design and supervise them if the federal government and the universities were no longer expanding it was time to find a new patron for the intellectual vanguard of the professional middle class and the neoconservatives hoped to find one in an obvious place the corporate elite 30 today the opposite is true upper middle class opportunities in the corporate and financial sectors are under pressure and these elites are slow ly but inexorably returning to the state their interests remain distinct from those of the working class but they are increasingly aligning with labor rather than capital neoliberal shackles any new realignment of the professional class however is complicated by the legacy of its previous turn toward neoliberalism for this group the embrace of markets and consumerism did not work out the way either its proponents or critics predicted as the new deal economy faded republican neoliberalism emerged as an alternative while this agenda required eliminating many of the bureaucratic jobs that went with the old model republicans offered the professional class one increasingly attractive inducement a chance to become essentially financial managers in the new shareholder economy in the 1980s these yuppies contributed to two reagan landslides yet only a few years later the democrats under clinton took these voters back the clinton democrats left reagan s economic changes intact and even accelerated them but they gave professionals greater scope to manage postmaterial concerns that suited their cultural sensibilities mainly by expanding the so called nongovernment sector ngos multilateral institutions government spon sored enterprises and other organizations that received private fund ing for nominally public purposes these institutions provided elite jobs and conferred prestige on the professional class while adding a gloss of legitimacy to a financialized economy in the clinton era rising neoliberal professionals acquired not just wealth but a new public power and significance and even a new popular mythology the rubin greenspan summers committee to save the world the slick war room campaign consultant the glamorized tech nerd the republicans could only offer greed is good reruns yet another book on tocqueville and a thin veneer of old line wasp affectation on top of a party increasingly reliant on déclassé values voters elite professionals flocked to the democrats in droves and all but abandoned the republican party the cost however was the loss of the traditional democratic working class base to which the new agenda was often hostile both economically and culturally on the other hand progressive neoliberalism offered a far more effective legitimation strategy for liberating capital from political control than reagan s reactionary neoliberalism to borrow nancy fraser s terminology 31 finance and tech billionaires began replacing unions as the most important democratic donors both to campaigns and to the growing network of liberal ngos thus upper middle class professionals who started moving left ward on economic issues in the 2000s now found themselves at odds with the democratic party machine they had previously constructed bernie sanders illustrated this in 2016 though obama also experienced it initially sanders s left wing challenge to clinton found significant support among educated relatively affluent voters especially younger ones similar to obama s as one 2016 vox headline put it bernie sand ers s base isn t the working class it s young people 32 within any given age group the article explained higher income voters were actually more likely to support sanders sanders however has insisted on characterizing his movement as a populist protest rather than an insurgency driven by certain disaffected segments of the elite in both of his campaigns he has attempted to mobilize the working class to remake the democratic party but the group he primarily attracts are the most radicalized elements of the professional class the young academics underemployed college graduates and so forth in order to mobilize sufficient numbers of the working class sanders would need something like the old new deal democratic party machine 33 but that apparatus is vastly dimin ished and the machine that does exist necessarily resists the threat sanders poses to its survival in contrast elizabeth warren s campaign more explicitly appeals to the professional class both in form and content directly appealing to this dominant democratic group allows her to co opt at least some portions of the party establishment the apparatchiks if not the donors for the moment her challenge to the clinton status quo appears more formidable yet her rise is still likely to strain a democratic machine heavily reliant on billionaire funders 34 it remains to be seen whether the concessions she will need to make to preserve the democratic apparatus will demoralize her own natural base many of whom remain with sanders and feel betrayed by obama or otherwise undermine her candidacy another obstacle for left wing upper middle class radicals is their own debilitating false consciousness which easily exceeds the confu sion frequently ascribed to the working class instead of frankly acknowledging their own professional class interests 35 they project their concerns onto the working class and present themselves as altru istic saviors only to complain about a lack of working class enthusiasm later this blindness often prevents them from recognizing where their interests diverge from the purported beneficiaries of their projects and impedes their ability to effect any larger political realignment it also exacerbates the temptation to double down on parts of the current paradigm such as enlarging the ngo racket which only strengthens the billionaires in the long term the self perpetuation of conservative mediocrity the republican party on the other hand faces a very different problem the absence of any significant professional elite which abandoned the party long ago from its inception modern conservatism has opposed the pro fessional managerial class that came to dominate business and govern ment in the mid twentieth century despite often shrill rhetoric against this new class however conservatives could never reduce its size or importance in the modern economy 36 instead republican policies merely encouraged this class to shift into finance and adjacent sectors at the same time conservatives sought to build their own new class by setting up parallel institutions in academia media law policy planning and so on initially the new conservative apparatus was fairly successful but institutions built on ideological conformity inevitably tend to ossify they also tend to be populated by mediocrities who are only there because they cannot make it into the top tier institutions after the rest of the professional class decamped to the democrats this husk was all that remained of the politically active professional elite on the right the conservative institutions became as detached and self refer ential as the postmodern academy they criticize and they long ago ceased to have any significant influence on broader elite discourse today their main offering to new recruits is the chance to someday apply for affirmative action for conservatives 37 the result is a highly stratified and largely dysfunctional republican party a few billionaires and corporate interests mainly those who cannot fit into the more attractive progressive neoliberal program pay their second rate propagandists to offer a discredited and incoherent policy agenda to an increasingly disaffected voter base from the republican establishment s perspective however this weakness is also its strength by repelling all professional elites except those content to be sinecurists of relatively unsavory donors the conservative new class minimizes any internal threats to its survival and the donors maintain total control over the party the voters may openly despise their own party s establishment they may begin voting for unacceptable candidates and causes yet ultimately they cannot set policy priorities or provide government personnel if more elite professionals remained in the republican party they might take advantage of voter discontent to challenge the billionaires and replace the entire decrepit apparatus they would likely find that task much easier on the right than it is in the democratic party as it stands however the conservative movement can continue to lurch on as a zombified superstructure if nothing else it still uncon sciously serves an important purpose advancing the interests of while providing a useful foil for the more important billionaires in the democratic party the alienation of elite labor professional class opposition to the political and economic status quo will almost certainly continue to intensify beyond economic pres sures at least two additional sources of elite anxiety will push in this direction the emptiness of today s professional careers and the obtuseness of the billionaire class as working class jobs have become more precarious and demeaning professional jobs have become more meaningless and depressing anthropologist david graeber has defined an entire category of bullshit jobs and traced their proliferation throughout the corporate world and other sectors 38 in large part these are make work positions for professional elites that exist primarily to pad the prestige of those above them these jobs are not simply menial or dull and they are often well paying but they are utterly pointless and some times even internally acknowledged as such for all the talk of market efficiency the information economy has created a vast category of professionals who do nothing but copy and paste mckinsey info graphics into presentations for no social or even narrowly commercial purpose after graeber published his first essay on the topic tens of thousands of readers began sending their own accounts of their expe riences in these positions to graeber and other commentators to quote one example as far as i could tell very few white collar workers at p g really did anything all i saw was a lot of bureaucratic box ticking and people patting themselves on the back for work that they hired consultants to do for them p g as a whole really just reminded me of the trust funders i went to college with there was zero exposure to actual risk or competition but everyone had to pretend to be innovating and competing in order to justify their success 39 and these experiences are not limited to staid conglomerates in ma ture industries the reality in much of silicon valley may be even more depressing the company i now work for started as a parking app we were growing sustainably as the result of having a superior product based on a great understanding of consumer needs but sustainable growth isn t what vcs or the execs that they install in the firms they have stakes in are looking for so we pivoted without going into too much detail we are now exclusively focused on getting acquired by a big tech firm meetings with low level product managers at a few of the world s largest com panies dictate every decision about which projects we pursue we re no longer building a company we re not even building a product we re building a feature that we hope will end up getting included in an app owned by a mega corporation when i talk to my friends and peers at other tech startups they tell me that it s pretty much the same story at their compa nies everyone is building to the specifications set by google or amazon or apple this competitive industry supposedly a shining example of the power of the free market is really just a massive risk free r d department for the faang companies 40 contrary to the pervasive mythology of entrepreneurialism and crea tivity it is glaringly obvious to today s professional elite that the neoliberal economy is allocating capital and especially talent very poorly the conclusion of one recent empirical study of corporate law firms greater amounts of work that associates consider more interesting is negatively correlated with firm profitability 41 could be applied across most elite job categories this state of affairs is not only disorienting to professionals indoctrinated to believe that their career should be their passion it also foreshadows further economic pressure on their class when the next recession the increasing automation of white collar jobs and the logic of shareholder primacy all take their toll the purposelessness of many professional careers in the capital accumulation economy starkly contrasts with the growing number of unaddressed needs in the public sector the legions of finance drones making utterly pointless discounted cash flow models could be far better employed designing a serious industrial policy the engineers currently laboring over algorithms to make social media more addic tive should be funded to focus on more productive technological advances all the effort now devoted to coming up with new pricing strategies for old drugs could be directed at real medical problems like increasing resistance to antibiotics the vast resources invested in unprofitable ride hailing apps and real estate arbitrage could have been used to solve america s ever increasing public infrastructure and housing challenges in the early 1980s opening up financial markets and other neo liberal reforms created many opportunities which were both finan cially and personally rewarding for professional elites the new deal institutions and nifty fifty corporations had by that time decayed into dull ibm ified bureaucracies but wall street banks and investment firms were exciting places to work populated by original and fascinating characters the corporate world was in the midst of needed reorganization new business models were being created and silicon valley was just getting started today however most of these workplaces are thoroughly rou tinized slogans about changing the world have long since morphed into powerpoint slides on widening the moat elites climb 99 per cent of the way up an ever greasier pole only to spend most of their time focusing on cutting costs and increasing share buybacks or marketing taxi services vaping products and food delivery as tech nology government bureaucracies to be sure are as sclerotic and frustrat ing as ever but the opportunity to restructure and revitalize the state the only way to address the most important issues of the present appears far more exhilarating to growing numbers of talent ed elites than any other alternative adding insult to injury amidst or perhaps more accurately be hind all of this is the absolute degeneracy of the american billionaire class as if the present political and economic dysfunction were not enough to prove their corruption our exalted plutocrats seem intent on publicly displaying their vacuousness many of these people presumably possess some narrow technical ability though if so it is less and less evident but they conspicuously lack any self awareness much less insight into issues of broader human concern as will be obvious to anyone who bothers to read ray dalio s autobiography likewise one could watch every episode of david rubenstein s talk show vanity project peer to peer con versations only to come away with the impression that rubenstein has never asked an interesting question in his life in fairness how ever he is not half as self deluded as tom steyer michael bloomberg or howard schultz the case of donald trump speaks for itself conservative donor gatherings are somehow even more pathetic most of the attendees are there only because they are not smart enough to recognize that the democratic party offers a far more effective reputation laundering service the rest are probably too senile to know where they are at all there is often a special irony to these events an uninspiring ideologue is usually on hand to repeat a decades old speech decrying communism recounting the horrors experienced in countries ruled by a self dealing incompetent nomen klatura and marked by a decaying industrial base crumbling infrastructure poor education system a demoralized populace low confi dence in public institutions falling life expectancy repeated foreign policy failures a vast and arbitrary carceral system constant surveillance and even massive power outages in major cities 42 imagine that the bold thinkers of silicon valley are at least as delusional mark zuckerberg must be the only person in the world who still pretends to believe his self serving banalities about connecting people through social media jeff bezos publicly muses about the difficulty of finding a useful way to deploy his financial lottery winnings 43 while amazon stations ambulances outside its warehouses to treat employees who collapse from exhaustion 44 at least amazon and facebook can claim to be successful compa nies however wework s adam neumann who recently received a 1 7 billion exit package is leaving his firm in complete chaos shelved ipo filings describe neumann as a unique leader who has proven he can simultaneously wear the hats of visionary operator and innovator while thriving as a community and culture creator 45 but the only entrepreneurial instinct he ever displayed was in ripping off his own company in related party transactions 46 neumann cannot even pretend to have pioneered a new business model several other companies have been doing the same thing more successfully for years he simply happened to be one of the cult leader personas cho sen by softbank to enjoy the benefits of recent bank of japan mone tary policies 47 in this case softbank should have taken a lesson from google which hired eric schmidt after his dismal tenure at novell to serve as the buttoned down figurehead for its ipo many industry observ ers believe schmidt contributed virtually nothing to the company but he became a billionaire because of his superior grasp of business etiquette google policy is to get right up to the creepy line and not cross it he once said 48 jeffrey epstein erstwhile dinner companion of schmidt bill gates and seemingly every other member of this class 49 had a slightly different policy what is remarkable about today s oligarchy is not its ruthlessness but its pettiness and purposelessness an all consuming megalomania might at least produce some great art as a side effect but this collec tion of mediocrities cannot even do that their political activities whether pushing for a slightly lower tax rate or throwing money at a self serving brand of faux progressivism are too small minded to be anything other than embarrassing this class has no idea what to do with its wealth much less the power that results from it it can only withdraw and extract socially and economically while the political justifications for its existence melt away ultimately the question that will determine the future of american politics is whether the rest of the elite will consent to their contin ued proletarianization only to further enrich this pathetic oli garchy if they do future historians of american collapse will find something truly exceptional capitalism without competence and feu dalism

another important dispatch from the greanville post be sure to share it widely china s 70 years development and the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind this is the title of an international conference organized by the chinese academy of social sciences cass which i was privileged to attend from 5 7 november 2019 in shanghai it is a reflection on china s anniversary of 70 years revolution her most remarkable achievements with a joint look into the future the future of china linking up with the rest of the world the link was clearly presented and seen as the new silk road president xi jinping s bridge building belt and road initiative representatives from over 140 countries and international organizations presented their vision on how they might cooperate with china for a shared future the result is a rich palette of ideas and potential opportunities for cooperation members of the chinese leadership had these words to open the international forum the year 2019 marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the people s republic of china the achievements of china s development over the past 70 years show that we must remain committed to the path of peaceful development and pursue a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up since the 18th national congress of the communist party of china china has made positive contributions to promoting global openness connectivity mutual benefit and common development and has played an important role for the world peace and stability at present in order to cope with the uncertainty in globalization we should positively explore ways to construct an open world economy elaborate measures to build consensus among international community and provide intellectual support for building of the community with a shared future for mankind the conference was extremely constructive by all contributions presenting ideas in pursuit of harmonious win win situations in cooperation with china this is precisely the concept behind china s drive for building bridges between countries and designing joint ventures no coercion no subjugation they have to be equally beneficial for all partners this is the secret to harmony and to a peaceful coexistence this concept follows the thousands of years old teachings of tao which are still and will remain china s philosophy in directing her foreign policy in that sense one may have observed that the often brutal challenges that china is facing from the united states in particular and the west in general got a bit short changed in the discussions participants did not want to harp on the negative encounters that china is confronting almost permanent aggressions a smear campaign false accusations conflict provocations sanctions in the form of trade and tariffs in short an emerging ever growing economic war while not to focus on adversity is a positive omen yet it presents the myriad of good ideas under a veil of a dreamlike reality clearly though china s ever peaceful search for harmony instead of hostility will give her the upper hand eventually avoiding violent confrontation what the west does not understand does not want to understand is that china follows a non aggression policy and yes i m repeating myself emanating from the ancient thousands of year old tao philosophy of harmony and peace china s ever peaceful search for harmony instead of hostility will give her the upper hand eventually avoiding violent confrontation what the west does not understand does not want to understand is that china follows a non aggression policy and yes i m repeating myself emanating from the ancient thousands of year old tao philosophy of harmony and peace the shared future for mankind forum run in parallel with the giant 2019 chinese international import expo ciie also in shanghai where about 67 countries were exhibiting their key export goods in total 180 countries and regional as well as international organizations 3 800 enterprises and 250 corporations of the forbe s 500 list were participating the expo had a wide range of products and gadgets to offer from watches to drones to smart kitchens and self driving cars and artificial intelligent ai in the form of smart robots so smart one was compelled to ask who is in charge me or the robot what resonated throughout the conference is the remarkable progress china has made in her 70 years of revolutionary existence progress physical and sociological no other country has achieved in recent history china started on 1 october 1949 at ground zero miserable poverty famine epidemic diseases education and health services were few and far between and of low quality essential medication was largely absent all the result of centuries of western and japanese colonization exploitation and enslavement from that abysmal level thanks to chairman mao s two pronged revolution starting with what he called the great leap forward 1958 1962 a communist party of china cpc led a social and economic campaign converting rural agrarian areas into a socialist industrialized economy through communal farming and agricultural cooperatives as was to be expected this 4 year effort was constantly attacked by infiltrated anticommunist saboteurs at a high social and economic cost for china the great leap was followed by the ten year cultural revolution 1966 1976 aiming at cleansing china from infiltrated foreign paid capitalist elements and influences these capitalist assets had only one goal breaking the revolution and its spirit at an early stage and returning china to the western usurpers they definitely did not want china to flourish under her own political communist values and beliefs lest china might become an example for the rest of the world to the detriment of western oligarchs and colonialists foreign meddling in china s early stages of chairman mao s revolution as well as now carries a huge cost for china therefore portraying china s revolution as a failure was a typical western lie propaganda campaign it also served to hide the west s own disastrous economic and geopolitical failures around the globe propaganda converts lies to truth in complacent societies this is what s happening today more than ever in the west from the perspective of the chinese reality mao s revolution and the subsequent evolution have improved life in china like no other movements or reforms in china s recent history it created a public education and health system eradicating illiteracy as well as deadly endemic diseases alleviation of poverty being a prime focus of mao s revolution it has lifted about 800 billion people out of poverty thereby generating a better equilibrium in the nation s wellbeing it laid the groundwork for chinese scholars to advance china towards food self sufficiency which she attained in 2018 today china s progress in research science and technology keeps advancing at an incredible speed advancements include transport infrastructure public transportation systems like high speed maglev magnetic levitation trains that have largely surpassed european and even japanese systems in speed punctuality and comfort artificial intelligence ai is being promoted and advanced through a newly developed us 2 1 billion ai industrial park ai is already today used in manufacturing in ports loading facilities as well as in medicine even in surgery ai is also used in 3d printing it is expected that within 15 20 years the vast majority of chinese will have access to 3d printing in other words they will have the possibility to invent and produce new tools and products as well as building modifying and repairing their own homes home based infrastructure and of course much more to summarize china s progress the observations of a high ranking beijing university professor may be indicative when he first experienced london s tube subway system in the early sixties he thought this was a dream for china fifty years on china s underground transport system in urban agglomerations has largely surpassed the one of major western cities in speed ease of access cleanliness and discipline the focus of a shared future for mankind forum was of course president xi jinping s belt and road initiative bri potentially the bridge that spans the world the bri has become essentially china s foreign policy guiding vehicle and rightly so because it could indeed propel the world towards more harmony more peaceful cooperation cooperation with socioeconomic benefits for all bri has currently some 160 members countries and international organizations and is steadily growing including in what might well be considered adversary countries like many in europe while for some strange reasons europe the eu still seems to be obliged to follow washington s dictate there is an increasing awakening namely that the most logical and most beneficial way for all to do business is across the huge transcontinental area of eurasia which also includes the middle east where bri through joint ventures could become an instrument for conflict resolution after all hundreds of years before the british empire moved across the atlantic to north america gigantic eurasia was the normal trading ground for adjacent as well as more distant countries russia and the far east were linked up with western europe today going back to this principle would be a giant step forward away from ever belligerent and coercive relations with an aggressive and destructive anglo american empire we may eventually get there indeed in the context of bri economic growth was also on the table china s rapid decline from years of 11 and 12 growth to now 5 to 7 was a concern is china s economy going into a slump is it failing what happens was a worrying question if not spoken then inferred by innuendo the response is rather simple china s rapid and enormous growth was mostly accumulating along the eastern highly urbanized shores creating a development gap with the chinese eastern countryside a planned reduction of growth allows for a more even distribution a more horizontal than vertical growth meaning addressing more social and locally focused development something china can do because her public banking system works for the benefit of the people not for some far away shareholders and it is less bound to the use of natural resources mind you a 5 or even 4 growth is still a multiple of the west s average besides growth is a linear western capitalist indicator focused on ever more capital accumulations for ever fewer people and corporations china today is the world s second largest economy in absolute gdp terms us 14 3 trillion 2019 est projected to bypass the us us 21 3 trillion 2019 est by 2025 or earlier but measured by purchasing power parity ppp china is already today the world s number one economy indeed ppp is the only meaningful indicator what counts in the end is how much can you buy in your country with your economic output everything else is almost irrelevant in addition china is practicing a stable and secure monetary policy unlike western currencies the yuan is backed by a solid economy and by gold in 2017 the yuan was officially admitted into the basket of the imf s sdr special drawing right which contains the us dollar 41 73 euro 30 93 chinese yuan 10 92 japanese yen 8 33 and the british pound 8 09 by having been admitted into the sdr basket china has become officially a reserve currency and is actually rapidly replacing the dollar as a world reserve currency the world increasingly recognizes that the dollar is like its younger cousin the euro is but fiat money meaning based on nothing other than debt because it is indiscriminately printed or computer generated as needed amounting to a colossal pyramid or ponzi scheme the current us debt to gdp ratio is about 105 however what the us general accounting office calls unmet obligations amounts to more than 700 of gdp net present value of total outstanding obligations discounted to today s value according to former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan responding to a journalist s question we will never pay back our debt we will just print new money the gigantic amount of us dollars flooding the world estimated at more than 50 of total convertible money compares to less than 3 of the chinese yuan no matter treasurers around the globe increasingly realize that a yuan based reserve is worth more than one based on fiat us dollar nominated assets in conclusion this first of its kind cass organized conference provided for an excellent stock taking and for a vision ahead it presented many ideas and offered myriad opportunities for networking among think alikes and potential partners what is however key to success is that this effort does not stand alone that there will be a follow up to monitor and register what may have emerged of the ideas and proposals put forward at the forum and how new initiatives may be solidified while the west remains stagnant self centered and self concerned china and with her her eastern allies russia the shanghai cooperation organization sco the eurasian economic union eaeu open up to new ideas to the world in general they offer to connect the west could learn a tremendous amount of wisdom from china but of course this may not be written or said aloud the dominant west would never admit such truth for it would require the west to abandon a never ending war economy and to also seek peace and harmonious relations in a multi polar world to attain a shared future for mankind this is an article by senior contributing editor peter koenig

we are protesting against problems in the whole system a young chilean protester said on tv in november above all the neoliberal system the increasing cost of everyday life drove more than a million people from numerous world capitals into the street in october chilean protesters fought cops as buses were torched ecuadorians used satellite dishes as shields against police tear gas in lebanon people barricaded roads and held mass sit ins at state buildings since july throngs of haitians and iraqis frustrated at government corruption filled the streets even braving sniper fire and pulling down razor wire blockades the protests in the global south reinforce those in the global north like france s yellow vests and spain s indignados now a possibility is emerging a vision of a new internationalism that could upend nearly 50 years of neoliberalism class war the chilean who threw a rock at an armored police van also struck the half century ideology of neoliberalism even as today governments send police in riot gear to defend that economic ideology it s worth remembering that it was first promoted by its authors as a way to protect individuals against the state although the state intervention they were worried about at the time involved services and support that helped millions the idea of neoliberalism took shape during the great depression and after world war ii when economists milton friedman and friedrich hayek watched in growing dismay at collectivism or state intervention in the economy in the 1930s president franklin d roosevelt dealt with labor strikes and widespread poverty by turning john keynes s ideas of government spending to stimulate a moribund economy into the new deal in 1945 britain facing a mass demobilization of soldiers and a people tired of war time austerity created a large welfare state the u s s r was a superpower rivaling the west so friedman hayek and others met in 1947 at hotel du parc and formed the mont pelerin society to fight keynesianism and marxism they believed the more power the state took the less the individual had until it ended in totalitarianism hayek wrote in his 1944 book the road to serfdom to achieve their ends planners must create power power over men wielded by men democracy is an obstacle to this suppression of freedom he and friedman saw big government as a potential enemy of the people it had to be kept small they said it had to be limited or it would turn on us neoliberalism was a fringe idea ignored until it became a useful tool for capitalists to reassert dominance in the 1970s economic convulsions from the 1973 oil crisis and stagflation scared the ruling class david harvey in his 2005 book a brief history of neoliberalism wrote in the u s the control of wealth by the top 1 percent of the population had remained fairly stable but in the 1970s it plunged the upper classes had to protect themselves they seized the ideas of hayek and friedman and put them into practice with the election of ronald reagan in the u s and margaret thatcher in the u k neoliberalism became a hammer for the global north to discipline domestic and international labor fueling the fire the great depression produced massive suffering said marxist economist richard wolff in an interview with truthout there was a right and left wing reaction both wanted to radically reorganize society it ended in a victory of the left with the new deal and social democracy in europe but they left the capitalists in the same position with every incentive to undo all the social programs just put in place it s like defeating an enemy but leaving them weapons neoliberalism became a hammer for the global north to discipline domestic and international labor in a replay of history late 20th and 21st century neoliberalism repeated the mistakes of the laissez faire economics that led to the great depression the top 1 percent pursued class dominance through market fundamentalism in the u s the price of neoliberalism was a growing social divide and people falling between the cracks it was pushed by republicans and democrats from president carter deregulating trucking trains and airlines to reagan who cut taxes for the rich and cut welfare to clinton who cut welfare established the north american free trade agreement and removed the glass steagall act the untold effects culminated in the 2008 great recession which nearly melted the world economy and led to occupy wall street outside the u s the price of neoliberalism was state terror and dire poverty in 1973 the u s backed a coup against socialist chilean president salvador allende which led to the killing of thousands of leftists chileans who studied under friedman restructured the economy it deepened inequality in haiti the u s backed dictators papa doc duvalier and his son baby doc who stole the nation s wealth and rained down terror a popular uprising threw baby doc out in 1986 but the u s returned in 2004 to force in a neoliberal friendly regime in july 2018 the haitian government raised fuel taxes on an already desperately poor people in 2003 the u s invaded iraq and the coalition provisional authority ran the war torn country through the neoliberal gauntlet by eliminating taxes privatizing 200 state run companies and later privatizing the oil iraq was left in ruins in 2017 ecuador s newly elected president lenin moreno vowed to continue the leftist program of his predecessor and subsidize the poor instead he took a hard neoliberal turn and declared a cut to gas subsidies new taxes and labor reforms to meet the terms of an international monetary fund loan in 2019 lebanon s government levied new taxes on whatsapp gas and cigarettes neoliberalism whether through the ballot or the bullet has ripped up the post world war ii social contract and left nations teetering on the edge of collapse every time someone lost a job or faced a price hike every time a person felt shame at being unable to afford a decent life tension rose and simmered state capitals floated on an invisible sea of gasoline vulnerable to a spark in ecuador haiti lebanon and chile the sparks flew one after another from a new tax to a bus fare hike to the removal of gas subsidies the new internationalism are we seeing the rise of a new left internationalism is it possible that working class people will struggle together against the common enemy of neoliberalism can they unite across national borders race and religion if so the time to strike is now today s capitalism is in a vulnerable in between state corporations are leaving the global north in search of cheaper labor in the global south and in doing so creating a sense of betrayal among citizens in the former and anger at being exploited in the latter wolff told truthout by the 1970s with the introduction of jets and the internet it was possible for capital to leave the old centers in the global north and go to mexico china or the global south and there you see a rerun of capitalism in its early stages pollution huge amount of people thrown from the country to the city both the global north and the global south face a bleak future in this equation the decline of capitalism in the west is a product of capitalism wolff added it means the future of the u s is laid out in the economic deserts of detroit youngstown and pittsburgh there is no precedent on how people handle the reality of a long downward fall if the protests in the global north are often driven by a betrayal of a promised better future and the protests in the global south are often driven by raw exploitation we may have entered a decisive phase where neoliberalism can be attacked from multiple angles in his book the true believer thoughts on the nature of mass movements eric hoffer writes it is usually those whose poverty is relatively recent the new poor who throb with the ferment of frustration the memory of better things is a fire in their veins it may be an apt description of the millennials who entered a bankrupt west and were forced into a precariat existence they were the vanguard of occupy wall street in the u s the indignados in spain the yellow vests in france and the protests in puerto rico in contrast the protests in the global south where capitalism has ripped up raw resources used cheap labor and divided society into a few rich and many poor the demand is driven by a rebellion to protect what is most human in albert camus s book the rebel he wrote rebellion the sudden dazzling perception that there is something in man with which he can identify the part of himself that he wanted respected he proceeds to place above everything else even life itself if one adjusts the gendered language the point remains that the youth in the arab spring and now in lebanon haiti chile ecuador and iraq are not primarily fighting for a far off promised future but to live decently right now a new generation in the global north and the global south is rising up against neoliberalism we may be at a precious and rare turning point in history marx wrote in the communist manifesto what the bourgeoisie therefore produces above all is its own gravediggers if so the fires raging in the city streets are where the ideas of neoliberalism are burning in a funeral pyre before you go truthout faces a serious threat after 22 years of

authored by christoph gisiger via themarket ch tad rivelle chief investment officer of the californian bond house tcw doubts that the central banks can prevent the impending economic downturn he spots increasing signs of stress in the credit sector and recommends holding safe assets to be prepared for turmoil in the financial markets mr rivelle who rarely gives interviews views the prospects on the financial markets with skepticism in his opinion it s clear that the business cycle is in its final stages he warns that the power of unconventional monetary policy is largely exhausted and nervousness in the credit sector is growing against this background he advises a defensive calibration of the portfolio and a careful approach when it comes to security selection especially in the investment grade segment where many companies are more leveraged than their rating indicates mr rivelle the rally in stocks has lost some of its momentum recently nevertheless the s p 500 is near its all time high what s your take on the current market environment we re very skeptical of taking risks in this market since there is fairly abundant evidence that we re in a late cycle type of environment equity valuations are largely following the script of the central banks the central banks say dance and the equity market is dancing in contrast debt investors increasingly say there is nothing in it for me to get on the dance floor because as a debt investor all i get back is a 100 cents on the dollar we re the asset class that s always at risk of loss the federal reserve can say and do whatever it wants but if it can t get the private sector to follow through with cheap financing and debt markets become skeptical of providing favorable financing i don t know where you go with that globally there s around 12 trillion in negative yielding debt how do you approach such a market as a veteran fixed income investor it s an absurdity and an artificial condition for instance a swiss company like nestlé finds itself in some kind of financial paradox they can issue negative yielding debt in swiss francs and then use the proceeds to buy back their own equity if you want to reflect on this philosophically why have any equity at all you could just buy it all back that leads to the next observation your assets theoretically are producing benefits and your liabilities are producing benefits too this would imply there s no cost running your business at all this is obviously a hint that markets didn t get to negative interest rates through a negotiation process between borrowers and lenders rates were pushed off the cliff by the central banks what are the consequences of these artificially low interest rates the collective and extraordinary expansion of central bank balance sheets has powered the bull market in everything but these absurd policies aren t going to work for the long term in this cycle the zeitgeist has been that the central banks have the capacity to maintain growth and prosperity in others words if you control the financing right to corporations and consumers you can make the economy grow forever this flies in the face of common sense economics used to always be about the idea that you need to incentivize producers to make efficient choices if you give them the right incentives they will raise the bar in terms of value addition and growth over time but when you artificially chose your rates you are doing the opposite you re causing bad choices by definition where are such bad choices evident today the low rate environment has created excesses in a lot of areas it has driven up asset prices and as you drive up enterprise multiples you drive up leverage multiples look at private equity the best idea that most institutional investors say is in their portfolio is private equity that s strange since the whole concept of private equity is basically that you buy up businesses you put a lot of leverage underneath them you don t mark things to market at least not the same way as the public markets do and you create this illusion of low volatility investments so you have a system where company managers get enabled to say ridiculous things to their investors like we don t care about profits i don t think we would have a company like wework if we didn t have an environment where investors are thinking that they need to invest in a fairy tale because they can t earn a return any other way what s your take the wework disaster wework was one of these situations hiding in plain sight there were plenty of people who expressed skepticism yet you had money center banks playing along making loans and adding to the credibility of it so you had a fairy tale you had a 47 billion unicorn two or three months ago that now had to be rescued i ll go further if softbank didn t rescue wework would you really want to find out what the lawsuits are going to discover when the limited partners sue softbank when they ask how did we get to 47 billion exactly and while you re at it you might be even doing that in a court in riyadh so maybe this point the best course of action is just to pay everybody off and then figure out what to do where are other disasters hiding in plain sight when you get to the last phase of the cycle you need to be thinking about what could go wrong because there is very little probably that s going to go right today a lot of carnage has come to the fracking area there are a lot of e p capital structures that are evidently no longer financeable in the capital market a lot of these businesses are probably going into bankruptcy also you see stress in automotives in semiconductors and in retail what s more it s fair to say that the bank loan market represents one of the significant risks out there what are red flags investors should watch out for the number of high yield credits trading at spreads over a thousand basis points over treasuries has been rising all year long also you re seeing a lot more volatility in the leveraged lending space credit investors increasingly are firing first and ask questions later this speaks back to another of the excesses in this cycle traditionally the deal was that if you are a leveraged company you were given two choices in the debt markets door number one you can show the world what your financials are adhere to the public standards issue high yield bonds and report to the sec and your debt investors what s going on door number two if you don t want to show your numbers you had to get your hands tied behind your back the lenders will give you the money but they won t let you do much of anything with it because they want to make sure you re not doing something stupid while they can t watch you and what s going on in this cycle this cycle we have moved to an environment where what was a covenant heavy bank loan market has become a covenant light bank loan market as a debt investor you don t have transparency and you have no ability to constructively restrict what management is doing private equity plays into this dynamic because it has used its market power to negotiate on behalf of its portfolio companies so we ve seen a worsening of covenants and credit agreements some of this relates back to a basic dynamic that the fed and other central banks have put their hand on the scale they re basically communicating that they want to make it so easy for borrowers that lenders are saying cash is burning a hole in my pocket i need to do something with it how does this end we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us this is how it all ends badly think about the dna of markets let s say you want to buy a house in a red hot market you show up at the first day and there s twenty people looking to buy you want to do your due diligence and ask about the foundation the roof and maybe the crazy neighbor finally you get hold of the seller and he s like i don t have time i m not answering your questions the only thing i want to hear from you is how much over the full offer price you want to pay that s the way the credit markets were in 2017 drive by deals were done and investors like ourselves got the call in the morning saying company xyz is raising 500 million you re in or you re out so no time for due diligence that doesn t sound like prudent behavior now fast forward a couple of years and suppose you re in a stone cold housing market you list your house you wait three weeks and finally some barely qualified buyer walks through the door and wants to know about your foundation your roof and the crazy neighbor after you re done answering his questions he s got more and more questions because he recognizes intuitively that every time you can t answer a question he can make a worse case assumption and use it as justification to knock your price down so suddenly the market has become completely illiquid and very hostile at which stage are we in the credit markets today generally if you re involved in a bank loan that doesn t have the parameters a clo would naturally buy the sponsorship is thin if everything is fine you probably won t experience a lot of volatility but miss your earnings or communicate some bad news and investors drop challenged credits like hot potatoes that s logical because your business has been operating in the dark you haven t told your lenders anything for years now the only news you re giving them is bad news so they have to assume that this bad news hasn t just happened yesterday but there are deeper ongoing issues they want out but there is no bid on the other side that s why a liquidity crisis is all but inevitable how long until these developments evolve into a bigger issue for the financial markets we thought it was going to happen two years ago credit markets look late cycle manufacturing looks pretty late cycle and corporate profitability as well so the proliferation of negative rates may also suggest that central bank policy has reached exhaustion it s almost like negative rates are the last thing central bankers are trying to make it work what are the chances of a recession against this backdrop it s a little hubristic to say we re going to have a recession in the next twelve months what s not hubristic is to say that these policies are not working and we will inevitably have a recession didn t we try this at least once or twice before didn t the soviet union have zero percent interest rates didn t they have recessions maybe it wasn t visible in the official statistics but their recessions were manifested by longer lines at food stores what have zero percent or negative interest rates to do with that artificial asset prices distort resource allocation and growth look at the fact that sears and kmart are for all intents and purposes just about to disappear on the scrap yard of history all the resources invested in stores labor and capital are worthless so the faster you get rid of it presumably the better off you re ultimately going to be recessions are not optional they are inevitable it s the process in which it s all getting washed out and rearranged it s like don t you want to get to the passing lane eventually or do you want to be stuck in the right line because you re afraid of change eventually you have to do it anyway an important piece of the puzzle is the us consumer how healthy are households in the united states financially the us consumer is divided you have the middle and upper class consumer which seems to be in fine shape at the moment you wouldn t expect differently because consumer proclivity to buy is a function of income employment and housing prices so middle class people in general feel more secure with employment as high as today and their house worth 20 more versus what it was ten years ago on the other hand the subprime consumer is more credit dependent and metrics there are not really good we re seeing deterioration in delinquency rates and charge offs for the lower range of credit counterparties the problem is that this is where a lot of growth ultimately comes from from the marginal buyer what does it mean in terms of fed policy are more rate cuts coming down the road let me be maximally charitably to the fed they have no backing by elected officials from either party to do anything but lower rates in response to incremental economic weakness so it s fair to say that if the economy weakens they will lower rates more regardless of what they say it won t happen this year i presume but i guess in 2020 they re going to cut rates again we invented central banks because we figured out that the banking system if left to its own faith is too volatile and that we need a state sponsored institution to cushion the blow but somehow we went from there to the fed buying 60 billion of t bills a month calling it not quantitative easing and central banks in europe and japan imposing negative rates what s the yield on the ten year treasury going to be in a year from now i would say somewhere around where it is today between 1 5 and 2 but that s just a wild guess it s a question of timing and causation if this becomes a global led downturn you have to assume that us rates are going lower but you can also imagine other scenarios us rates being above overseas rates has brought huge capital inflows and people are getting very used to the idea that these capital inflows will always hold down us rates but what s going to happen when these flows reverse for who knows what reasons and us rates go up what should a prudent investor do under these circumstances you should adapt your underwriting standards to the kind of environment that you are in so beginning a couple of years ago we adopted our underwriting standards to be much more careful with respect to the types of risks we re taking throughout our whole portfolio in other words stay vigilant focus on staying liquid focus on safe assets and wait for volatility to present opportunity so how does a robust bond portfolio look it was benjamin graham pointing out that bond selection is a negative art that s especially true in the late cycle cycles die in large measure because capital gets tied up in unprofitable enterprises so you need to think long and hard about what claims are breakable and can suffer catastrophic and permanent price declines there may be a time to own breakable assets but after they break and not before what are such breakable assets today there will be plenty of breakable assets and a lot of them will be in the high yield and bank loan market some maybe even in the investment grade market today 11 of investment grade issuers are levered more than five times an 27 are levered more than four times in this context you could make a pretty good case that 50 of bbb debt would have a high yield rating based on leverage alone where are better places to invest we re counselling to divide your assets between bendable assets and riskless assets for the liquidity issues that we re going to encounter i would put treasuries and agency mortgages as the risk off liquid part of the portfolio you can t retire on them or really do anything with it but you can own them tactically to finance the expansion of your bendable assets assets that are exposed to mark to market risk meaning they go up and down so they may be exposed to liquidity risks but they provide you yield today and their claims will survive into the next cycle if you have done your categorization right what are attractive bendable assets bendable is what we refer to as true investment grade credit also aaa rated commercial mortgage backed and asset backed securities as well as senior non agency residential mortgage backed securities stuff that we re invested in obviously in some cases aaa rated clo tranches can potentially make some sense too and if you can find them some high yield securities maybe or a few emerging market securities you try to find companies with a wide enough moat around what they re doing like regulated utilities as long as they re not in california where you have a special environment with damage claims from wildfires
published tuesday 26 november 2019 print disqus daniel r amerman a new era began for us all in september and october of 2019 with the introduction of a new element that is likely to become one of the dominant investment market influences in the 2020s what is shown in the orange area of the graph above is something brand new when we understand why the federal reserve abruptly reversed course created 280 billion in new money in two months and injected it into the financial system then we can also explore why this new element could still just be getting started and could lead to quite different prices and risks for stocks bonds and homes in the 2020s making the new decade entirely different from the 2010s or any previous decade already 23 trillion in debt the u s government will have a voracious need for cash in the 2020s ordinarily a government in this situation would have to pay steadily higher interest rates to get that money but the federal government can t afford to pay higher interest rates without the annual deficits and the national debt exploding upwards as explored in the previous chapter entirely separately and as explored in numerous previous chapters the federal reserve s main tool for maintaining financial stability is that of interest rates the fed has its own quite different existential need to maintain very low interest rates or to even rapidly force them much lower at will however if the federal government sucking staggering sums of cash out of the markets on a monthly basis over the coming years ever sends interest rates spiking upwards as almost happened in september then the fed s ability to maintain stability could collapse along with the basis for the currently elevated values of retirement account investments and homes across the nation on the other hand as also explored in previous chapters the process of maintaining stability could lead to still higher home and stock prices as of the fall of 2019 the day has arrived when the financial impact of the national debt on average savers and investors is no longer theoretical but rather something that has the potential to radically change home prices retirement account values and financial security for the average person in any given month or year and the real time linkage that can cause these losses or gains is not some distant default or round of hyperinflation while everyone is at risk the great majority of the population does not yet understand the new direct linkage of deficits to their financial security the very real current dangers or the counterintuitive ways in which the soaring national debt could actually act to increase the household net worth of the nation for at least a time they need to or the risk is a blindside to the lifestyles and retirement plans of many tens of millions of people that could be larger and more enduring than the financial crisis of 2008 this analysis is the 18th chapter in a free book the earlier chapters are of essential importance for understanding the linkages between interest rates home prices stock prices and bond prices as well as how the fed s heavy handed interventions have already changed the fundamentals of investing an overview of some key chapters is linked here an interest rate spike an abrupt reversal the first problem occurred during the week of september 16th 2019 the base issue is that in order to fund spending the government needs to pull massive amounts of money out of the us economy on an ongoing basis this money needs to come out in one of two forms either taxes or deficit borrowing in the week of september 16th both were hitting simultaneously third quarter corporate withholding taxes were due which was the tax side it was also settlement day for a recent treasury auction that had involved new funding for the government this is crucial because a lot of treasury sales involve rolling over existing borrowings so the money comes out to investors from the treasury paying off the old borrowings that means the money is there for investors to buy the new obligations and on a net basis the government is not pulling its spending money out of the private economy however on a simple basis there are always levels within levels when it comes to government accounting when the government is spending more than it takes it in from taxes then it needs the cash to do so and that cash comes from the private sector or other sources in the form of new debt sales so to the extent that the government runs ongoing deficits those are funded with new cash that has to come in from somewhere estimates vary but in september of 2019 somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 billion had to pulled out of the private sector and much of that money for corporate withholding taxes and funds to purchase new treasury obligations to finance deficit spending was parked in the repo market lent to financial institutions at very low interest rates then in october of 2019 about 134 billion of net new federal borrowings needed to be funded and that money had to come from somewhere as did the money for november the graph above is based upon congressional budget office projections and it shows that during the 2020s the u s government plans to have annual deficits above 1 trillion every year every single year the u s government intends to spend at a trillion dollars more than it will collect in taxes that is the base case if everything goes as planned not a stress test and that means that it has to get at least a trillion in cash from somebody or somewhere each and every year without exception and that is before some of the extraordinary promises for future spending that are being proposed in an election year when we look at the deficits on a cumulative basis then the plan is to spend about 12 2 trillion more than is taken in through taxes over 10 years so the plan for the 2020s is for the federal government to pull an average of about 102 billion in cash out of the financial system each month furthermore unless the money is coming in from the outside i e foreign governments or investors or the social security other trust funds or the federal reserve then the money needs to come in from somewhere in the u s private sector whether that be financial institutions corporations or individual savers it is worthwhile to compare the size of the red slice in the pie above to the cumulative total of planned deficits in the 2020s the total ownership of u s treasury obligations by individuals banks insurance companies mutual funds and other private investors is only about 5 7 trillion so unless the money comes in from somewhere else then the base plan to run 12 2 trillion in deficits in the 2020s means that the federal government intends to borrow about 214 more money from domestic nongovernmental sources than it has borrowed over the entire previous existence of the nation on a simple basis not adjusting for inflation this is a fantastic sum of cash that the government plans to pull in from the rest of the nation just as one comparison it greatly exceeds the total of all student loan debt outstanding all auto loans outstanding and all credit cards outstanding so if everyone took every dollar of student debt they owed everything they owed on their auto loans and every dollar they own on their credit cards then all of that together for the entire nation would not even be close to how much cash the federal government intends to get from us all via borrowing during the 2020s as explored in the previous chapter if the interest rate on the national debt were currently at long term historical averages averages for a much less indebted nation then that by itself would be enough to add another 15 trillion to the national debt over the next ten years not including any other deficit spending this would be on top of the 12 trillion in cbo projected deficits and would then radically increase the amount of cash the government would need from investors and the financial system each month how the national debt and changes in interest rates work is actually a good bit more complicated than that because of the weighted average life of the national debt but it is still fair to say that a rapid increase in interest rates would rapidly increase deficits which would rapidly increase the need for still more cash and could thereby set off still more interest rate increases and still higher deficits if the national debt were being financed in a free market an entirely separate but equally existential issue for individuals and the nation is that as shown above and extensively developed in previous chapters we currently have asset values for bonds stocks and homes as well as gold for separate reasons that are at levels that are far above historic averages these highly elevated asset prices are based upon and dependent upon what are very low interest rates by historical standards and indeed as introduced in chapter one link here our current very high stock and home prices are based on the maintenance of a quite unusual situation that of negative real interest rates when the rate of inflation is higher than the interest rate paid then investors lose purchasing power each year this is an unnatural state for investors but yet the fed has on average been maintaining this state since 2001 and our current retirement account and home values are effectively dependent upon the fed maintaining this unnatural state into the future now what makes this unnatural situation persist over time is to have lots and lots of liquidity the need is to have an abundant supply of money with free cash sloshing around all through the system so long as there is enough cash floating around much of it goes to where the federal reserve acting as both regulator and monetary authority has set up the system to encourage it to go which is to short term treasury bills the repo market and fed funds at rates that are far below historic averages however the danger is that when the u s government is acting as what could be likened to a gigantic vacuum cleaner voraciously sucking that free cash out of the financial system in order to fund its deficit spending the government might pull so much cash out that in any given month or day that the remaining free money floating around in search of a home might not be in great enough supply to fund the debt and other short term borrowings at the irrationally low interest rates that the fed is counting on that would be a real problem and that brings us back to the fall of 2019 sucking the excess liquidity out of the system a routine job for a corporate treasurer or a banker is to maximize the float earnings the daily return on cash right up until the moment the cash is spent the corporations that had taxes due on september 16th and the entities that had bought new treasury obligations and needed to pay for them at settlement each needed the liquid cash to do so and a very common place to park that money right up until the moment it needs to be spent is in the repo market the repo or repurchase agreement market is not something that most individuals are familiar with but it underpins the u s financial system and is an extremely important source of cash for many banks and institutional borrowers a repurchase agreement is essentially a secured loan that is legally a sale collateral generally u s treasury obligations is sold to a buyer who is effectively a lender there is a simultaneous agreement at the time of the sale to repurchase the collateral at an agreed upon price and time which is usually the next day the difference in price between the sale price and the contractual repurchase price is effectively the repo rate of interest which is generally close to the fed funds rate for overnight repurchase agreements institutions who need cash enter in repurchase agreements with institutions who have excess cash and this happens behind the scenes on a massive basis everyday in the u s and indeed it underpins the liquidity of the u s financial markets and the major participants it usually works flawlessly and the markets and the stability of the u s financial system depend on this happening now while the repo market is generally overnight lending many financial firms use it as an ongoing source of funding they have to repay the money each day and they may not actually have the cash to do so instead they rely upon being able to borrow through a new repo agreement every day to repay the money they borrowed via the repo agreement from the day before this is generally a seamless and absolutely reliable process and while the interest rate varies on a daily basis they count upon the money being there and within a certain reasonable range in terms of interest rates the week of september 16th the repo borrowers had to give the lenders their money back so the u s government could pull its 100 billion in cash for the week out the financial markets and fund its deficit spending no problem the repo borrowers turned to the repo market to borrow the new cash so they could repay the previous day s loans like they did every day only this time the money wasn t there uh oh the repo borrowers absolutely needed the new money coming into the repo market in sufficient amounts to replace what was going out to the u s government ultimately or they could default the interest rate which was supposed to be below 2 went to 3 and 6 and even very briefly went to almost 10 as repo borrowers scrambled to find a way to get enough new cash to come into the repo market to replace what had to go out in a matter of hours in other words the liquidity ran out in that one crucial market and without the liquidity the fed s effective ability to force very low interest rates on the nation ran out even while the stability of the financial system was being imperiled now while the average person likely has no idea that any of this happened or even what a repo is the sum total of the nation s stock portfolios retirement accounts and homes were all teetering on the edge that week the federal reserve very briefly lost control of interest rates in one critical market as a result of not properly understanding how the u s government s voracious consumption of cash to finance deficits would suck more liquidity out of the system than the fed s economists thought it would another way of phrasing this is that the federal reserve thought there was more excess liquidity in the system than there was they thought they had ample safety margins to handle what they knew perfectly well was coming the week of september 16th and it was the u s government removing 100 billion in cash from the system in practice in that particular week that exposed the error in the fed s models that is the problem with the modeling of complex systems that haven t been tested particularly as an increasing number of pressure points further increase the complexity even while decreasing the tolerance for errors current stock bond and house prices in the united states are all based upon not just very low interest rates but the market s confidence that the federal reserve effectively has iron clad control over those rates and the ability to prevent an interest rate spike if the markets lost confidence in the fed and thought free market interest rates were a genuine possibility then the floor could fall out from underneath stock bond and home prices and this could happen in a swift and even catastrophic manner of course that isn t what happened but what did happen instead is one of the main reasons why the 2020s will be a very different decade for investors and homeowners than the 2010s and starting immediately flooding the financial system with liquidity faced with a liquidity crisis in the repo market the federal reserve created 53 billion in new money in an afternoon and directly supplied that money to the repo market this was a very rare action and it was the first time that the fed had directly put money into the repo market since the financial crisis of 2008 the fed repos were immediately oversubscribed meaning that the amount that the federal reserve had intended to be more than ample was not nearly enough more financial institutions needed cheap overnight money from the fed than it had realized so the next round was to put 75 billion into the repo market on the next day these were intended to be very temporary emergency interventions but instead the market grew dependent upon them as of november of 2019 the repo market was still dependent upon the daily injection of extraordinary sums of money by the federal reserve in order to function normally and in the interest rate range desired by the fed while very little noticed by the general population the repo crisis had the full attention of institutional investors in september of 2019 and afterwards because multiple ripple effects were in danger of being set off that could have very negative consequences in multiple ways however there was a problem the extraordinary federal government deficits are not a one off but are an expected and continuous factor going into the indefinite future even as the fed has an existential need for maintaining far below free market interest rates also into the indefinite future as part of the cycles of crisis and the containment of crisis the immediate problem is that while the september funding of 100 billion in government cash flow could be funded by the federal reserve maintaining its new repo facility the u s government s ongoing deficit spending would suck another 134 billion in cash out of the financial system in october of 2019 and then more in november where was that going to come from and at what interest rates so the federal reserve scrambled and announced a quick emergency reversal of course their planned program of shrinking the balance sheet and reversing a previous decade of monetary creation i e quantitative easing qe had already abruptly stopped earlier in 2019 as part of a quick and extraordinary pivot the fed committed to a new program of rapid balance sheet expansion and began purchasing 60 billion per month of short term u s treasury obligations in a program that will extend at least into the second quarter of 2020 when we add together the two new liquidity components of 1 the fed creating money to stabilize the repo market and 2 the fed also creating money to buy 60 billion per month of u s treasury obligations from the markets and not the treasury then we get the orange area above this creation of 280 billion in new money in two months offset 40 of the fed s 690 reduction in its balance sheet that had taken eighteen months to achieve all those years of talk about how the federal reserve would slowly unwind its qe monetary creation from its last round of the containment of crisis as covered in chapter eight all went out the window and without even any form of crisis that the general public was aware of when we take just the 60 billion per month and extend it over the next ten years then we get the illustration graph above which is based upon the earlier graph of cbo projected budget deficits the new monetary creation works out to 720 billion per year and it could be the critical component when it comes to enabling the ability of the u s government to suck out over a trillion dollars per year in new cash out of the system without sending interest rates soaring upwards of course this is just an illustration the federal reserve has not announced any ten year plans in this regard on the other hand given that the rubicon has been crossed if the market does grow dependent on ongoing fed liquidity injections to at least partially offset the u s government voraciously pulling liquidity out of the system in order to fund its planned budget deficits when and how does this stop and given the increasing size of the projected future deficits are the liquidity injections more likely to go below or above the level 720 billion per year that is shown accepting that specifics in practice are likely to vary from the smoothed illustration shown if continued over ten years this would mean that 7 2 trillion of the planned 12 2 trillion in budget deficits would effectively be covered by monetary creation even if the money is never for several good reasons sent directly from the federal reserve to the u s treasury this would leave an additional 5 trillion of deficit financing that would need to come in from other investment sources and whether that would happen at very low interest rates that are likely to be below the rate of inflation remains to be seen however the chances of bringing in 5 trillion in new money at very low rates has to be seen as being much higher than the chances of bringing in over 12 trillion at irrationally low interest rates now let s return to our graph from chapter eight the historical and future size of the federal reserve balance sheet and add in the orange of ongoing liquidity injections monetary creation at a rate of 60 billion per month in this graph i ve separated the green area of the historic growth rate in federal reserve assets from the blue area of quantitative easing that was associated with the prior cycle of the containment of crisis as covered in chapter eight despite the solemn assurances of the federal reserve in 2008 that this extraordinary policy of creating money effectively from the nothingness and using it to directly move markets would be used only on a short term basis in dire emergencies the increase in power for the fed was too much to give up and the fed kept expanding its assets as it found new uses for monetary creation with the full recovery of the economy the fed really was supposed to wean itself and the markets off of relying on this emergency tool however as can be seen in the shrinkage of the blue area above the fed was only able to travel a relatively short distance on the return to normality before abruptly stopping in the summer of 2019 as shown if the planned creation of 60 billion per month in new liquidity were to continue over time then this effective partial funding of the budget deficits while keeping interest rates far below what a free market would demand will fundamentally change the nature of the federal reserve its balance sheet and the u s dollar itself the national debt supercycle asserts dominance had interest rates soared in september and october this would have had devastating consequences for stocks bonds and homes indeed many trillions of dollars of household net worth could have already been lost if the federal reserve had not intervened with extraordinary acts of monetary creation on an emergency basis creating 280 billion in new money and injecting it into the system to flood the markets with new cash this isn t a distant theory this is right now and this is likely to not only continue but to grow ever stronger in the coming years our world has genuinely changed and the extraordinary acts of fiscal discipline and political willpower that would be needed to reverse direction don t seem to be anywhere in sight instead it is quite the reverse as presidential candidates compete to buy votes by promising spending could exceed what is shown herein by fantastic margins to the extent they think about it at all many people seem to see the national debt as being some abstract concept or political issue that has no impact on their day to day lives they would not even dream of changing their savings or retirement account decisions to take a 23 trillion national debt into account the very idea of doing so would be just completely foreign to them unfortunately these people will be in for one heck of a surprise at some point and perhaps much sooner than they think for the many millions of people who do care deeply and who do recognize just how surreal and short sighted it is for the united states to be running 1 trillion a year deficits on top of a 23 trillion national debt it seems that they often see the national debt in very negative terms and with a life changing price to be paid at some point down the road there could be a future default or a future round of hyperinflation but in the meantime before the collapse arrives they usually don t seem to see any connection between their current financial decisions and planning and what is happening with deficits or the debt if the reader will permit let me quote myself from an analysis on this subject in may of 2014 in some ways the current extraordinary level of federal debt could be likened to sharing our solar system with a financial black hole just because people aren t seeing it every day doesn t mean it isn t there whether seen or not the massive gravitational pressure dominates everything around it and every time someone saves invests retires or makes a major purchase the massive weight of that 17 5 trillion debt pulling interest rates down through the corresponding governmental interventions impacts their life right that minute while this massive weight affects every part of society there is one group that is more affected than any other that group is the people who are following traditional retirement planning or other long term investment strategies this has been on the way what happened five years later in september and october of 2019 was that the rapid growth of the black hole the staggering monthly amounts of cash that deficit spending is pulling out of the system nearly reached out and pulled us all in to continue the analogy the surprised crew of our starship at the fed were asleep on the job their navigation model did not properly account for just how much liquidity was being pulled out of the system and it was only the emergency change in course and application of 280 billion in monetary creation rocket fuel so far that allowed us to break free i do realize that for most people changes in total federal reserve assets sounds highly theoretical with an excitement factor that falls somewhere between watching paint dry and watching the grass grow hopefully using the analogy makes the orange area above a little more clear in terms of why it happened how close we came the radical change in course and why the federal reserve is pouring on the rocket fuel in the attempt to climb out of the danger zone as the cumulative result of decades of irresponsible political and monetary decisions we are in very interesting times as the 2020s approach and there is nothing theoretical about just how quickly the success or failure of those emergency maneuvers could change the day to day lives of many millions of people who by and large have absolutely no idea that any of this is happening a predictable collision in confirmation of the predictable nature of something like this happening and why it is likely to be far more important in the coming years transforming the 2020s i would like to also offer the quote below from an analysis i wrote and published in march of 2018 the united states government has a voracious need for new money but with an over 20 trillion debt it can t afford to pay higher interest rates over the long term the federal reserve is currently going through what could be called a market liberalization cycle or a quantitative tightening cycle where it reduces the supply of artificial money and lets the market fund more of the federal debt with real money at higher interest rates that is a daunting task how to get huge sums of money without paying whopping interest payments that would send the national debt upwards and out of control how are the u s government and fed going to do that is there a well thought out and brilliant plan for doing so early indications as seen in the market this week is that there is no plan they have no idea how to do this and they are just going ahead anyway the government needs the money to feed a politically created major increase in deficits so it is borrowing the fed s textbook says this is the time in the business cycle to raise rates so it is raising and the two trains are speeding down the track straight at each other the government just sold 126 billion of treasuries on monday and it had difficulties which meant it had to pay higher interest rates that was before auctioning the 169 billion planned for later in the week to fund the government s deficit driven need for about 300 billion in cash in a single week whether we want to call it being pulled into a black hole or the head on collision of two speeding trains this has been coming in plain sight for a very long time as i have been explaining to readers over the years however what is much more important is what is on the way what we know right now when looking at projected budget deficits is that unless there is some kind of major reversal of course this will just get more powerful each year and is likely to have an ever greater impact on stock prices bond prices housing prices and gold prices in each year changing them in ways we never saw in the 2010s or previous decades starting in 2020 there are also growing implications each year when it comes to financial stability and the chances of a crisis of potentially epic proportions the march of 2018 public analysis with the collision between trains above also appeared in the 2019 overview dvd set and manual pages 165 172 that was released in december of 2018 as being one of the critical changes that was on the way and to keep an eye out for as well as being one of the conflicts that could cause the fed to reverse course on interest rates and quantitative easing of course the fed did do so in 2019 with higher stock bond and home prices being among the results more information is available in the seven 2019 scenario results linked here understanding the linkage in the previous seventeen chapters of this book in progress i ve worked hard to create a series of analyses that explain things like federal reserve policies the economic cycle interest rates in nominal and real terms and how they change home and investment valuations the roles of quantitative easing and monetary creation and how all of these are coming together to become dominant influences on stock prices home prices and bond prices in ways that we have not seen before in practice and in real time my hope for those who have been reading along to this point particularly for those of you who are not financial professionals is that these essential factors are really starting to make sense and that you are understanding the connections as well as the very practical and even life changing implications once those are understood then something else can also be understood that is what a 23 trillion national debt is really all about the true systemic danger of endless 1 trillion annual deficits how those powerfully intersect with cycles of crisis and the containment of crisis and how they are doing so right now for the average person the immediate danger from deficits and the national debt is not government default or hyperinflation it is setting off a potentially calamitous destruction of the value of their retirement accounts and homes in order to see this the linkage has to be understood and hopefully this and the previous seventeen chapters have been helpful to you in seeing how all the various pieces come together this danger could be a number of years away or it could be less than a year away we are all living inside a highly complex system in unprecedented circumstances with many outside stresses while the federal reserve has extraordinary monetary powers we are already seeing that even in

borne the sentence and then in 1956 president eisenhower signed the law making it compulsory to include it on all us money 9 us dollars aren t greenbacks current us dollars aren t greenbacks greenbacks were dollars created and used by republican president abraham lincoln in the 1860s they were created out of necessity as the union was going to fast run out of money to fight the civil war so in 1861 congress permitted the printing of 50 million demand notes which were printed with green ink on the reverse thus leading to the coining of their famous name it soon became apparent that these would also not be enough to fight the war so reluctantly president lincoln began issuing full legal tender us dollars also printed in green on the reverse side despite the fact that these and a variety of other notes through the course of us financial history are no longer printed they all remain legal tender though if you find one it may be worth more if you keep hold of it for the historic interest 8 rare bills rarely seen us denominations exist or have existed in the past pretty much everyone knows about the 2 bill now so you can no longer use it to prank people but another lesser known and definitely less likely to be seen note is the 100 000 that was printed in the 1930s for use between banks as gold notes after the abolition of private gold ownership these are still illegal to own these notes made it easier for the us government to rob the entire nation and hand its wealth over to a private company with secret ownership more on that soon at other times there were also 500 1 000 5 000 and 10 000 notes all of which remain legal tender to this day but like greenbacks these are worth more to collectors than their face value so don t spend them 7 graybacks and redbacks while we ve all heard of the greenback lesser know are the grayback and redback the grayback was the currency of the confederate states of america and 1 million were issued just prior to the start of the civil war they had no value beyond the promise of the confederate states government to pay out in the event of winning the civil war or forming a treaty with the united states their value fluctuated dramatically as battles were won and lost with a massive 20 devaluation occurring immediately upon the loss of the gettysburg battle and then there is the redback the redback was the official currency of the republic of texas issued in 1839 and 1840 to help cover the costs of the national debt in all they issued currency in the following denominations 5 10 20 50 100 and 500 the bills were called redbacks because of the shade of the ink used to print them 6 dollar coins this is where it all got its start the spanish dollar called the piece of eight real de a ocho or peso was used throughout pre revolutionary america and was also widely used around the world so much so that it was effectively the first global currency it remained legal tender in the us even beyond independence until 1857 the word dollar comes from taler the name of a coin first minted in the 16th century and named for joachimsthal the place where the silver for the coin was mined the symbol s origin is unknown with the best guesses being that it is an aberration of the p and s from spanish pesos or that it is simply a distorted variant of the number 8 referring to the pieces of eight these days the ubiquitous silver dollar has morphed into a gold dollar along the lines of dollar coins found in other nations the american dollar coin pictured is not frequently seen despite being issued as change by a number of public transport systems such as the new york metro 5 money vs currency before we continue we need a little primer money is not currency and vice versa here s a good summary of what money is medium of exchange it is widely accepted as a medium of exchange portable it can be carried along and exchanged durable it can be used a number of times without degrading fungible its one unit is equivalent to another divisible it can be divided into smaller units of value store of value it should maintain its purchasing power gold is traditionally an example of money it meets all of the above criteria but what about the cash in your pocket that is not a store of value for reasons that will become apparent as you read the cash in your pocket is currency it stands in place of real money and it is a very useful thing when greedy governments can manage to keep the supply stable but usually they can t it used to be that the gold standard gave us a finite amount of money against which we could peg our currency but in 1971 nixon shocked the world by causing the us dollar to float with the promise that the money supply would remain stable this meant that america didn t have to exchange us currency for physical gold the problem is that as more demand arose for government spending more money got printed when you print new currency it is called inflation and it devalues the existing stock if the government doubled the currency supply tomorrow all the cash in your pocket would be worth half it is like a stealth tax quantitative easing in 2008 did just that it massively over inflated the supply of us dollars that currency had to go somewhere so it ended up being pumped into the stock market and led to the current situation in which stocks are listed with values that make no sense at all zero profits with mega stock prices this does not bode well for the future 4 no one knows who owns the private banks currency is printed by the privately owned federal reserve bank the fed is not a government institution it is owned by a group of state federal reserve banks and in turn they are owned by well no one knows that s right the control of the us dollar is almost entirely in the hands of a secret group of people all we know for certain is that the current bank was created on december 23rd 1913 with most democrats voting to create the bank and most republicans voting against creating it it is the third central bank in the us with the first being created in 1791 when george washington signed it into creation at the urging of alexander hamilton its charter expired in 1811 and five years later in 1816 james madison re instated it as the second us central bank which lasted until 1837 after that there was no central bank until the creation of the current fed interestingly during this time of no central bank andrew jackson became the first and only president ever to pay off the national debt 3 it is made from thin air here is a very simplified explanation of how currency comes to exist the us treasury prints a thing called a treasury bond t bond which is a promise to pay the face value plus interest you get paid your interest annually and the t bond eventually gets paid off usually 30 years the federal reserve bank creates line items in its spreadsheets which effectively equals a bunch of currency without physical form and uses it to buy the bond from the treasury department treasury can then print cash and mint coins suddenly currency has come into existence from nothing except a promise of repayment with interest so every dollar in circulation right now is a debt promised by the treasury to the holders of the treasury bonds the fed and the public the fed holds 2 5 trillion of u s treasuries which is roughly one sixth of u s debt held outside the government 2 you pay tax because of it this is such a hard one to comprehend someone has to pay the interest on the treasuries mentioned in the previous item but the currency comes from the fed so where does the currency come from for the interest tax in 1913 both the federal reserve bank system was created and the federal with a capital f government instituted income taxes those taxes are used in part to pay the interest owing to the private bank for the treasuries it owns by now you might have noticed something quite significant this is a legal ponzi scheme the treasury makes currency out of thin air to pay interest on the currency it already made out of thin air we all know what happens in a ponzi scheme eventually so here s the golden question why doesn t the treasury just print the currency like it did in the old days and eradicate the interest component abraham lincoln did it garfield hated central banking and paraphrased said that whoever controls the money of a nation controls that nation and is absolute master of all industry and commerce mckinley was bitterly against a fiat currency they say jfk was planning to restore money vs currency these guys didn t just hate central banks they had something else in common i wonder what it was 1 the end is nigh remember when i explained that the fed owns all those treasuries do you want to hear something scary from 2008 the economy nearly died as the property market began collapsing taking the banking sector down with it so the government in conjunction with the heads of the banks and the federal reserve bank came up with a plan quantitative easing in its most simplistic form the idea was this the fed will buy all the bad mortgages this they discovered was a clever little tool they could use again later when the economy looked like it might falter if a company looks like it could go down and take the economy with it no problem the fed can just bail them out with stock buys this of course removes risk from the free market which leads to terrible behavior what we have now is not free market capitalism it is central bank driven pseudo capitalism companies do not thrive because of their profits they thrive because a cabal of unknown bankers is funneling money at them occupy wall street had a lot to do with rejecting this idea diverting people s attention to other more trivial matters is very much in the bank s best interests right now do not peep behind the curtain president trump frequently praises the state of the economy and i understand he is trying to fulfil a job of stoking consumer optimism but he is dead wrong despite what he says we are on the edge of a catastrophic depression because the federal reserve is printing money and buying up bad stock all over the place to hide what is coming in 2008 the fed kicked the can down the road in 2019 we are nearing the end of that road root of all evil and a bonus item that is not specifically us related money is the root of all evil clearly the judeo christian religions hate money not only is it the root of all evil but god himself said that rich people can t go to heaven you know the old camel through the eye of the needle bit well there are two issues here let s start with the first the bible doesn t say that at all here s what it does say in 1 st timothy 6 10 for the desire of money is the root of all evils which some coveting have erred from the faith and have entangled themselves in many sorrows in other words because of their love of money some people have and will wander from the faith and become evil money itself is not condemned as for it being easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle than a rich man into heaven this is clearly a rhetorical device being used to illustrate how difficult it is to remain good when money is abundant it is basically a corroboration of the root of evil statement so if you re rich enjoy it but be good to others on the journey

unchanged at its current level over the next couple of years he noted that dynamics of participation and unemployment flows will have an important bearing on wages growth as well as household income

brazil russia india china and south africa or the brics economic bloc are engaging in discussions to issue cross national digital money in order to reduce the dependence of their economies on the united states as reported by cointelegraph on nov 14 what will the new cryptocurrency look like how does the brics group plan to use it and are there any existing projects underway that seek to achieve a similar goal of independence on such a high level brics and its problems brics is the largest geopolitical block of countries spanning three continents and wielding substantial economic power in global affairs as of 2018 the five nations of the brics block had a combined nominal gross domestic product of 40 trillion or about 23 2 of the gross world product however such economic power does not come without competitive penchants from other nations that are vying for the markets that brics nations cater to the greatest competition comes from the european union and the u s the political experience of recent years has shown that brics countries diplomacy has arguably failed in alleviating international sanctions especially in politically sensitive markets such as the arms and the energy carriers markets however advances in technology are here to help out where politics cannot as blockchain and digital assets have the potential to open entirely new horizons for finance the idea of a single cryptocurrency as a means of payments and value transmission is not a new one but it is one that is being actively purported not only in countries like venezuela with its petro but also among brics countries the advantages of a single cryptocurrency as a universal means of settlements among brics nations would solve many of the problems they face on the global economic market a means of circumventing u s sanctions the brics business council discussed creating a common cryptocurrency as a potential solution to these problems during the 11th brics summit that was held in brazil on nov 13 14 according to reports that cite kirill dmitriev a member of the council dmitriev who is the director general of the russian direct investment fund went on to say that an efficient brics payment system could be used to stimulate settlements between the countries while reducing the use of the u s dollar for these purposes it was also reported that the new system may become an alternative to the international payment mechanism swift to facilitate trade with countries under u s sanctions dmitriev also noted that in recent years the share of u s dollars payments made between the brics countries has significantly decreased in russia for example over the past five years the share of usd in foreign trade transactions fell from 92 to 50 while those made in the russian ruble rose from 3 to 14 at the same time the potential for reducing the u s dollar s dominance is still great according to macroeconomic analyst oleg dushin who told russian media outlet bfm that such could be the case if russia and india changed the currency they use to make payments between each other dushin also said that russia and china have already stopped using u s dollars in half of their mutual settlements and that there is currently a general trend of driving the dollar out of the international payments system this according to the expert will help brics countries weaken the influence of the dollar in the global monetary system and reduce the risk of payments being frozen by washington denis smirnov a blockchain consultant from russia noted to bfm the convenience and reduction of transaction costs as some of the advantages of creating a single cryptocurrency system for the brics countries calling it an alternative to bonds commenting on the possibility of brics countries using a single cryptocurrency vladimir rozhankovsky an expert at the international financial center told bfm if it is possible to reduce currency risks then it is better to carry out trading payments directly and not through the purchase of dollars this is obvious the vast majority of more or less large global economies are now working on this issue peg to gold not the u s dollar while it is still unknown what the brics cryptocurrency will look like exactly experts are discussing what it could potentially be tied to commenting on the possible options that the international cryptocurrency may be tied elina sidorenko the head of the russian state duma s working group on cryptocurrency issues said that there are several options on the table for example it could be tied to the value of another cryptocurrency she told russian media outlet dp but in this case it s impossible to avoid either the continuation of the u s dollar s monopoly or it can be pegged to the price of a raw material or a good but then the risk of market manipulation becomes a threat she concluded the thirasd option is a link to gold and taking into account the latest basel accords such a decision seems very convincing and timely olinga taeed a council member and expert advisor at the china e commerce blockchain committee told cointelegraph that the chinese have been researching the possibility of issuing a gold backed token due to the country s access to natural mineral reserves in africa through china s belt and road initiative he went on to add more recently frictionless international trade has come to the fore with dlt looked upon as a possible solution for brexit for example replacing the usual 5 10 year gestation period so the thinking is well rehearsed but what is new here is the willingness to enact it and for evidence of this there is absolute clarity trump has made transparent the long established use of the financial instrument of the dollar to pressurise iran russia china etc for non financial gain russia seeks an alternative to swift russia has been the target of sanctions since 2014 as a result of multiple economic restrictions russian authorities have been considering the possibility of creating alternatives to swift one of them the system for transfer of financial messages or sfps is reportedly being used in 18 of money transfers in the country and foreign financial organizations began to join spfs in 2018 however in april russian finance minister anton siluanov noted that spfs is not a full fledged replacement for swift and that it is unlikely to become one in the near future now the russian government is considering another alternative a national cryptocurrency secured by gold elvira nabiullina head of the central bank of russia said that such a currency could be used to carry out settlements with other countries for trade transactions however nabiullina is also of the opinion that it is more important to develop international settlements facilitated by national currencies rather than crypto the sanctions had blocked at least 20 of russia s defense transactions in 2018 due their tether to the u s dollar though russian authorities are gradually moving toward settlements in national currencies with brics states the idea of a unified cryptocurrency is being openly discussed as an effective transparent untraceable and stable instrument for circumventing u s sanctions and decreasing dependence on the u s dollar brics states would be able to disregard any exchange rate differences in settlements in a single cryptocurrency and russia would gain solid support for its national currency the ruble which suffered a twofold drop in value china considering a national crypto to bypass u s sanctions china is the leading nation of the brics bloc in terms of gdp and the most open nation when it comes to discussions about blockchain implementation china is intent on accelerating the development of its own central bank backed digital currency and is working toward the integration of blockchain technologies into other important financial mainstays of the country such as alibaba tencent and various banking institutions related china s dive into blockchain digital id spurs rest of world to action such hasty development could in part be the result of a heated debates about facebook s libra coin chinese analysts fear that the development of a global digital currency by a company which is regarded to have strong affiliations with the u s would threaten the existence of national currencies and weaken their exchange rates such a stablecoin backed by the u s dollar may increase the power of its penetration into the global economy and thus solidify the political positions of washington chinese authorities are interested not only in the development of a unified cryptocurrency for settlements with brics countries but also in the launch of a national cryptocurrency that would serve as a shield against the economic adversary across the pacific brazil has a positive stance on using stablecoins brazil is demonstrating the highest rate of bitcoin btc trade in latin america such broad penetration of digital assets in brazil makes it both fertile ground for the development of a national cryptocurrency and firm ground to support for a unified brics cryptocurrency for settlements with member states related why has brazil s central bank included crypto assets in trade balance given the country s positive stance toward blockchain brazilian authorities seem to be open to discussions with stablecoin issuers one recent example is that of the mile unity foundation whose representatives met with members of brazil s ministry of industry foreign trade and services to discuss the use of the xdr stablecoin for international transfers of funds given that brazil had an export import balance of 219 billion to 140 billion in 2017 alone the potential for using a single cryptocurrency with brics member states for increasing such figures is immense although brazil does not suffer from sanctions its main trade partners in technology such as russia are subject to them using the u s dollar for mutual settlements between countries leaves little room to maneuver india is fighting with poverty and corruption the indian authorities are reportedly discussing the introduction of a national digital currency there may be significant reasons for such a move not the least of which being the alleviation of the poverty that many of the country s 1 3 billion are languishing in the reserve bank of india is pushing for such a digital currency backed and regulated by the central bank as legal tender the rbi hopes that blockchain can alleviate the issue with corruption which is rampant in india and significantly reduce the dependence of millions of indians working abroad on financial intermediaries in cross border transfers the indian authorities are also proponents of a national digital currency for reducing the population s reliance on other digital currencies given india s stance within brics as a major buyer of russian arms and as one of the most important energy trade partners having mutual settlements in a unified digital currency would open up entirely new prospects for trading south africa is making money transfers accessible for citizens the possibility of issuing a national digital currency has even been discussed by the south african reserve bank which could allow for its citizens to freely transact without the need for banks given the staggering number of unbanked individuals estimated to be around 11 million people and those without any form of official ids in the country the availability of a national digital currency would help millions of citizens gain access to financial services and boost economic development south africa is just as bound to the u s dollar as all the other brics members in its settlements with china and russia meaning that is also feels the impact of the sanctions regime experts say according to experts the idea of creating a digital currency for brics may turn out to be highly viable given the transition of the world from a monopolar political model to a multipolar one and the backdrop of a shift in the economy from traditional financial institutions to trading platforms and the main beneficiary so far could be china which is interested in expanding its sales markets amid a trade war with the u s smirnov told bfm that he believes that over time such systems will become more widespread for example for the past two or more years a consortium of several european banks has been testing its own mutual settlement solution that works outside the swift system and allows for interbank settlements the individual national currencies of the brics countries have been dropping against the u s dollar over the past 10 20 years but it is unclear whether a unified brics payment system would reverse this trend however it is possible that the u s dollar could be weakened if the share of settlements in dollars significantly decreases around the world among other possible risks that may be associated with the idea of issuing a gold pegged international digital currency head of research at investment company nord capital vladimir rojankovsky noted the deregulation of the market and the possibility of manipulation he told russian media outlet regnum such an implementation of this project does not imply the involvement of any distinguished party which is a living oversight body speaking about the further development of the brics initiative teemu alexander puutio an expert in compliance and an adjunct instructor at new york university school of professional services told cointelegraph

imf the funds could boost market confidence at a time when the country s economy is facing multiple risks the international monetary fund imf on monday said its executive board approved a smaller two year lending arrangement for mexico worth 61bn replacing the country s current flexible credit line of about 74bn the imf said the new arrangement would bolster market confidence at a time when trade uncertainty a sharp pullback in capital from emerging markets and increased risk premiums posed continued external risks to the mexican economy mexico s economy shrinks in first quarter imf world growth slowing to rate not seen since financial crisis synchronised slowdown new imf chief sees global growth threats the mexican government intended to continue to treat the arrangement as precautionary and planned to request further reductions in the credit line as external risks receded imf deputy managing director david lipton said in a statement mexico s economy has been buffeted by uncertainty over the past three years due to the threat of trade wars with united states president donald trump and the credit line is viewed as an important stabiliser for its financial markets mexico s finance ministry applauded the arrangement the decision of the imf s executive board underscores that mexico continues to meet all the qualification criteria needed to access if required and without any conditions the resources available through this instrument it said the imf s new managing director kristalina georgieva said last month the organisation would remain a strong partner of mexico following meetings with the heads of the mexican finance ministry and central bank the imf has recommended mexico reconsider its position of limiting private companies cooperation with state owned oil company pemex whose debt is weighing heavily on the government s finances mexico s previous arrangement was approved in 2017 for about 86bn but was scaled back to 74bn in 2018 at the request of the mexican authorities in his statement lipton lauded the mexican government s efforts to set strong fiscal policies that stemmed from the rise in the country s public debt ratio and a very tight monetary policy that helped reduce inflation he said financial supervision and regulation were strong and the flexible exchange rate of the mexican peso was playing a key role in the economy s adjustment to external shocks but he warned the economy still faced external risks including volatility in global financial markets increased risk premiums reduced capital inflows and continued uncertainty about mexico s trade relations with the us the us congress has not yet ratified a new trade agreement to replace the current 1 trillion north american trade agreement nafta among the us mexico and canada and it appears that ratification may slip to next year
two years ago the house rejected a budget blueprint drafted by the congressional progressive caucus that envisioned raising taxes by 9 trillion over a decade plowing 5 trillion of that into new spending and leaving the rest for deficit reduction considered radical at the time the plan was defeated 108 314 with 79 democrats opposing it democratic sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts is running for president on a platform that makes house progressives 2017 budget look milquetoast still by some metrics warren s got a plausible shot at the oval office she s polling well in iowa and new hampshire and handily beats president donald trump in head to head nationwide polls but warren s odds of winning the nomination have taken a dive in the realclearpolitics average over the last month coinciding with big question marks about her fiscal policies and their economic impact and even through impeachment proceedings trump s approval numbers are remarkably stable recession fears are fading and the stock market continues to soar critics are already painting a warren presidency as kryptonite for workplace retirement accounts held by some 80 million americans nonetheless warren is betting that a massive redistribution of wealth trillions of dollars in tax increases on rich people and businesses funneled to seniors students and families struggling with health and child care expenses will sell on the campaign trail below is cq roll call s analysis of warren s campaign proposals by the numbers really big government 30 trillion that s a rough estimate of how much more the federal government would collect and spend over the next decade based on figures supplied by warren s campaign and her outside advisers and previous proposals scored by the congressional budget office that figure is equal to more than 11 percent of estimated u s gross domestic product over 10 years according to the cbo it s also the approximate level of debt held by the public that would remain piled up at the end of the decade since total deficits would remain largely unchanged from current projections according to the national taxpayers union foundation warren a capitalist to my bones she says would impose more new taxes than the self styled democratic socialist also running for president independent sen bernie sanders of vermont federal revenue has averaged just over 17 percent of gdp since world war ii under warren it would average over 28 percent federal spending since wwii has averaged about 20 percent of gdp warren would boost that to over 33 percent based on data from the organization for economic cooperation and development warren s plans would vault the u s from 29th to 12th on a list of 34 mostly rich countries in terms of tax revenue as a share of gdp just behind norway and ahead of iceland and germany total u s government spending as a percentage of gdp currently near the bottom of the list would jump into the top tier of the oecd in line with italy sweden and austria not just millionaires 250 000 that s the income threshold where warren s new taxes would start warren would impose a new 14 8 percent payroll tax on income above 250 000 split between employee and employer to help finance a major expansion of social security benefits while keeping the program solvent another two decades some 5 million households could be affected at that income threshold according to irs data warren also says she d reverse the 2017 tax cuts for high earners which could herald a restored pease limit on itemized deductions named for its author the late rep donald pease d ohio pease limited deductions above certain adjusted gross income thresholds which in 2017 were 261 500 for single filers and 313 800 for joint filers a married couple filing jointly with an adjusted gross income of 320 000 today has an effective marginal tax rate the amount taken out of the next dollar earned of just over 27 percent under our hypothetical warren tax regime that rate could jump to 40 percent or roughly what a household earning twice that much under current law pays if warren also restored the pre 2018 tax brackets their effective marginal rate could top 48 percent 500 000 in 2019 it takes single filers at least 510 301 and joint filers 612 351 in taxable income after deductions to be in the 37 percent top bracket warren would return that rate to 39 6 percent and possibly restore the old lower income thresholds to capture all of the top 1 percent which in 2017 began at 515 371 in adjusted gross income according to irs data including increases in income and payroll tax rates under our hypothetical warren plan top bracket earners could pay a nearly 55 percent effective marginal rate the last time the comparable u s rate was higher was 1971 when the top bracket threshold was about 1 27 million in today s dollars including state and local taxes as well as payroll taxes the top tax rate on wages and salaries in the u s under warren would be higher than in france denmark norway italy and austria according to oecd data only belgium finland portugal slovenia and sweden s top rate would be higher soaking the rich 59 percent that s the potential top tax rate on capital gains where the real money is for the super rich under warren s plans the top 0 001 percent 1 433 households earning at least 63 4 million in 2017 according to the irs reported 63 percent of their income as capital gains and dividends that qualify for a lower 23 8 percent tax rate as a result the top 0 001 percent paid a lower average income tax rate than those earning as little as 233 000 to help correct what critics view as an unfair twist in the tax code warren s new 14 8 percent tax to bolster social security would also apply to investment gains starting at 250 000 for single filers and 400 000 for married couples that would result in the highest investment tax rates since the mid 1970s but warren wouldn t stop there for the top 1 percent capital gains and dividends would be taxed at the same higher rate as other income that would take the top rate on investment gains up to 59 percent leaving the current highest oecd rate denmark at 42 percent in the dust investors would also likely face the brunt of a new 800 billion tax on stock and bond purchases as financial institutions pass along the costs 160 percent the top 1 percent under warren would also face annual taxes on capital gains even if they haven t actually sold any assets that means well to do investors would pay taxes on gains that only exist on paper though they d be able to carry forward losses to offset future gains technically paper gains wouldn t be subject to the new 14 8 percent social security tax or the existing 3 8 percent investment income tax paid by those earning more than 200 000 250 000 for joint filers but many could be forced to sell assets in order to pay the tax on paper gains meaning they d bear the full brunt of all three investment taxes and for the richest households warren s wealth tax would lop 2 to 6 percent off total net worth each year for billionaires earning 10 percent on their investments or roughly the historical average return on the s p 500 the tax would claw back 60 percent of that gain if they earned a mere 6 percent the tax would be 100 percent including regular capital gains tax a billionaire s effective marginal rate on investment returns could hit nearly 160 percent in the lower gain scenario uber wealthy investors would need a roughly 15 percent return just to avoid the government taking every dime of their gains that s ok for a bill gates whose microsoft stock has rocketed by some 48 percent so far this year but as the proposal s authors proudly advertise billionaires would still see their total wealth decline over time as the tax policy center s howard gleckman pointed out in a recent blog post that s a feature not a bug in warren s plan loading the player the constitutionality of a wealth tax is the subject of much debate but if it could be done the u s would join only six other oecd countries belgium italy the netherlands norway spain and switzerland with some form of wealth tax according to research by the tax foundation s daniel bunn tougher than the swedes 76 800 that s roughly the income threshold in u s dollars at which swedes start paying the top income tax rate the top u s bracket starts at more than five times that income threshold as the tax foundation s kyle pomerleau noted in 2015 in the early days of sanders presidential aspirations the european social democracies warren and sanders would emulate generally raise more revenue from a greater share of the population than just the mega rich even the handful of wealth taxes applied among oecd countries kick in at substantially lower net asset values norway s is the equivalent of roughly 163 000 u s dollars at recent exchange rates or no threshold at all european countries get more revenue from regressive taxes generally than the u s does the u s generates revenue from consumption taxes totaling 4 3 percent of gdp for example while sweden raises three times as much denmark s consumption tax haul is almost 15 percent of gdp and their top marginal income tax rate starts at about 80 400 most goods and services are subject to a 25 percent value added tax in sweden and denmark for example something u s policymakers have studiously avoided for decades detractors say such a tax on goods and services would disproportionately hit the poor and decimate the retail sector but that tax has allowed many of these countries to reduce their corporate tax rates to the low 20s a trade off they ve viewed as beneficial to their economies corporate cash 78 percent warren would restore the old 35 percent corporate tax rate which republicans lowered to 21 percent in 2017 on top of that she d impose a 7 percent profits surcharge on corporations earning more than 100 million after new investment taxes facing high earners plus state and local taxes the all in tax rate on corporate earnings could hit 78 percent up from nearly 48 percent today the corporate tax rate would easily be the highest among oecd countries by contrast other oecd nations have consistently lowered their corporate rates in recent years with the non u s average dropping from 30 1 percent in 2000 to 21 7 percent this year 6 trillion the corporate tax rate increases would raise about 2 4 trillion warren would also raise multinationals tax rate on their foreign profits by close to 20 percentage points her advisers say by establishing a minimum 35 percent tax rate in every jurisdiction they book profits raising another 1 65 trillion and they d have to pay that tax annually rather than the tax deferral on earnings reinvested overseas that multinationals used to enjoy warren would also repeal depreciation and amortization rules that let companies take bigger write offs for equipment purchases research and development advertising costs and more raising 1 25 trillion another 150 billion would come from closing unspecified corporate loopholes then there are industry specific taxes such as a new fee on large financial institutions and repeal of fossil fuel industry tax breaks raising a combined 200 billion economists say around 25 percent of corporate taxes affect workers and stock ownership is much more widespread than just the very rich 52 percent of all u s households held stock in 2016 according to the federal reserve according to a 2013 joint committee on taxation study a little under half of the impact of a corporate tax increase would fall on households earning less than 200 000 arrayed against these new costs are a potential 200 billion savings to employers that would result from moving to a single payer health care system still warren s plans envision close to 6 trillion in new taxes over a decade on u s businesses while moving the u s corporate tax system in the opposite direction from much of the developed world middle class bonanza 9 7 trillion that s the net after tax household savings over the next decade from never having to pay health care premiums and out of pocket expenses under warren s medicare for all plan which would be phased in over three years gross savings over 10 years would total 11 1 trillion before 1 4 trillion in taxes taken out according to the kaiser family foundation an average family of four getting health insurance through the 2010 health care law s exchanges was likely to pay 12 550 in 2017 and an average family with employer sponsored insurance about 7 600 a separate kaiser study found medicare beneficiaries on average paid about 5 500 in 2013 workers with employer sponsored coverage now would pay taxes on wages that previously went to premiums so the average family would end up with a reduced net savings of about 6 300 warren would also eliminate deductions for large out of pocket expenses which some 10 million households claimed in 2017 as well as tax deductible health savings accounts that defray additional costs warren s projected costs for her health plan including covering some 32 million without insurance today and adding new benefits that aren t covered by medicare are about 7 trillion lower than urban institute experts anticipate if the savings don t materialize some or all of those cost savings could have to come from raising taxes or cutting benefits 5 4 trillion warren would spend trillions of dollars on expanding social security benefits child care subsidies and lowering college costs the average senior on top of paying thousands of dollars less for medicare would see an extra 2 400 in annual social security benefits annual bills for day care preschool and nurseries which according to moody s typically range from about 3 600 to 12 000 depending on income would be wiped out for households earning up to 200 percent of the poverty line or 51 500 in 2019 for a family of four no families would pay more than 7 percent of income for child care for an average savings of about 1 200 according to moody s that would be especially beneficial to households who earn too much to qualify for head start which typically cuts off at the poverty line but too little to benefit from child care tax credits which are nonrefundable in addition warren s plan would provide free tuition and fees at u s public colleges which averaged 8 800 in 2016 17 for a four year institution according to the national center for education statistics she d spend 100 billion more on pell grants for lower income students which today provide a maximum 6 195 per school year boosting overall spending on the program by nearly one third to help chip away at room and board costs that can average 11 000 to 12 000 and then there s student debt cancellation up to 50 000 wiped off the books for families with household income up to 100 000 reduced by 33 cents on the dollar up to 250 000 in income above which families wouldn t be eligible according to jpmorgan chase the average borrower in 2018 had about 33 000 in student debt with annual repayments running about 2 150 the bottom line including health care savings households with less than 250 000 in annual income are promised some 15 trillion in benefits over the next decade generally paid for with taxes on people making more than that in some cases a lot more that s the message the warren campaign needs to break through in the 2020 campaign without scaring away the suburban voters both parties covet

appreciation to the new york association for business economics nyabe and nyabe president julia coronado i will offer my preliminary views on the federal reserve s review of its monetary policy strategy tools and communications after first touching briefly on the economic outlook these remarks represent my own views the framework review is ongoing and will extend into 2020 and no conclusions have been reached at this time 1 outlook and policy there are good reasons to expect the economy to grow at a pace modestly above potential over the next year or so supported by strong consumers and a healthy job market despite persistent uncertainty about trade conflict and disappointing foreign growth recent data provide some reassurance that consumer spending continues to expand at a healthy pace despite some slowing in retail sales consumer sentiment remains solid and the employment picture is positive housing seems to have turned a corner and is poised for growth following several weak quarters business investment remains downbeat restrained by weak growth abroad and trade conflict but there is little sign so far that the softness in trade manufacturing and business investment is affecting consumer spending and the effect on services has been limited employment remains strong the employment to population ratio for prime age adults has moved up to its pre recession peak and the three month moving average of the unemployment rate is near a 50 year low 2 monthly job gains remain above the pace needed to absorb new entrants into the labor force despite some slowing since last year and initial claims for unemployment insurance a useful real time indicator historically remain very low despite some modest increases data on inflation have come in about as i expected on balance in recent months inflation remains below the federal reserve s 2 percent symmetric objective which has been true for most of the past seven years the price index for core personal consumption expenditures pce which excludes food and energy prices and is a better indicator of future inflation than overall pce prices increased 1 7 percent over the 12 months through september foreign growth remains subdued while there are signs that the decline in euro area manufacturing is stabilizing the latest indicators on economic activity in china remain sluggish and the news in japan and in many emerging markets has been disappointing overall it appears third quarter foreign growth was weak and the latest indicators point to little improvement in the fourth quarter more broadly the balance of risks remains to the downside although there has been some improvement in risk sentiment in recent weeks the risk of a disorderly brexit in the near future has declined significantly and there is some hope that a u s china trade truce could avert additional tariffs while risks remain financial market indicators suggest market participants see a diminution in such risks and probabilities of recessions from models using market data have declined the baseline is for continued moderate expansion a strong labor market and inflation moving gradually to our symmetric 2 percent objective the federal open market committee fomc has taken significant action to provide insurance against the risks associated with trade conflict and weak foreign growth against a backdrop of muted inflation since july the committee has lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 3 4 percentage point to the current range of 1 1 2 to 1 3 4 percent it will take some time for the full effect of this accommodation to work its way through economic activity the labor market and inflation i will be watching the data carefully for signs of a material change to the outlook that could prompt me to reassess the appropriate path of policy review the federal reserve is conducting a review of our monetary policy strategy tools and communications to make sure we are well positioned to advance our statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability 3 three key features of today s new normal call for a reassessment of our monetary policy strategy the neutral rate is very low here and abroad trend inflation is running below target and the sensitivity of price inflation to resource utilization is very low 4 first trend inflation is below target 5 underlying trend inflation appears to be running a few tenths below the committee s symmetric 2 percent objective according to various statistical filters this raises the risk that households and businesses could come to expect inflation to run persistently below our target and change their behavior in a way that reinforces that expectation indeed with inflation having fallen short of 2 percent for most of the past seven years inflation expectations may have declined as suggested by some survey based measures of long run inflation expectations and by market based measures of inflation compensation second the sensitivity of price inflation to resource utilization is very low this is what economists mean when they say that the phillips curve is flat a flat phillips curve has the important advantage of allowing employment to continue expanding for longer without generating inflationary pressures thereby providing greater opportunities to more people but it also makes it harder to achieve our 2 percent inflation objective on a sustained basis when inflation expectations have drifted below 2 percent third the long run neutral rate of interest is very low which means that we are likely to see more frequent and prolonged episodes when the federal funds rate is stuck at its effective lower bound elb 6 the neutral rate is the level of the federal funds rate that would keep the economy at full employment and 2 percent inflation if no tailwinds or headwinds were buffeting the economy a variety of forces have likely contributed to a decline in the neutral rate including demographic trends in many large economies some slowing in the rate of productivity growth and increases in the demand for safe assets when looking at the federal reserve s summary of economic projections sep it is striking that the committee s median projection of the longer run federal funds rate has moved down from 4 1 4 percent to 2 1 2 percent over the past seven years 7 a similar decline can be seen among private forecasts 8 this decline means the conventional policy buffer is likely to be only about half of the 4 1 2 to 5 percentage points by which the fomc has typically cut the federal funds rate to counter recessionary pressures over the past five decades this large loss of policy space will tend to increase the frequency or length of periods when the policy rate is pinned at the elb unemployment is elevated and inflation is below target 9 in turn the experience of frequent or extended periods of low inflation at the elb risks eroding inflation expectations and further compressing the conventional policy space the risk is a downward spiral where conventional policy space gets compressed even further the elb binds even more frequently and it becomes increasingly difficult to move inflation expectations and inflation back up to target while consumers and businesses might see very low inflation as having benefits at the individual level at the aggregate level inflation that is too low can make it very challenging for monetary policy to cut the short term nominal interest rate sufficiently to cushion the economy effectively 10 the experience of japan and of the euro area more recently suggests that this risk is real indeed the fact that japan and the euro area are struggling with this challenging triad further complicates our task because there are important potential spillovers from monetary policy in other major economies to our own economy through exchange rate and yield curve channels 11 in light of the likelihood of more frequent episodes at the elb our monetary policy review should advance two goals first monetary policy should achieve average inflation outcomes of 2 percent over time to re anchor inflation expectations at our target second we need to expand policy space to buffer the economy from adverse developments at the elb achieving the inflation target the apparent slippage in trend inflation below our target calls for some adjustments to our monetary policy strategy and communications in this context and as part of our review my colleagues and i have been discussing how to better anchor inflation expectations firmly at our objective in particular it may be helpful to specify that policy aims to achieve inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time or over the cycle given the persistent shortfall of inflation from its target over recent years this would imply supporting inflation a bit above 2 percent for some time to compensate for the period of underperformance one class of strategies that has been proposed to address this issue are formal makeup rules that seek to compensate for past inflation deviations from target for instance under price level targeting policy seeks to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path that is consistent with the inflation objective 12 under average inflation targeting policy seeks to return the average of inflation to the target over some specified period 13 to be successful formal makeup strategies require that financial market participants households and businesses understand in advance and believe to some degree that policy will compensate for past misses i suspect policymakers would find communications to be quite challenging with rigid forms of makeup strategies because of what have been called time inconsistency problems for example if inflation has been running well below or above target for a sustained period when the time arrives to maintain inflation commensurately above or below 2 percent for the same amount of time economic conditions will typically be inconsistent with implementing the promised action analysis also suggests it could take many years with a formal average inflation targeting framework to return inflation to target following an elb episode although this depends on difficult to assess modeling assumptions and the particulars of the strategy 14 thus while formal average inflation targeting rules have some attractive properties in theory they could be challenging to implement in practice i prefer a more flexible approach that would anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent by achieving inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time or over the cycle for instance following five years when the public has observed inflation outcomes in the range of 1 1 2 to 2 percent to avoid a decline in expectations the committee would target inflation outcomes in a range of say 2 to 2 1 2 percent for the subsequent five years to achieve inflation outcomes of 2 percent on average overall flexible inflation averaging could bring some of the benefits of a formal average inflation targeting rule but it would be simpler to communicate by committing to achieve inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time the committee would make clear in advance that it would accommodate rather than offset modest upward pressures to inflation in what could be described as a process of opportunistic reflation 15 policy at the elb second the committee is examining what monetary policy tools are likely to be effective in providing accommodation when the federal funds rate is at the elb 16 in my view the review should make clear that the committee will actively employ its full toolkit so that the elb is not an impediment to providing accommodation in the face of significant economic disruptions the importance and challenge of providing accommodation when the policy rate reaches the elb should not be understated in my own experience on the international response to the financial crisis i was struck that the elb proved to be a severe impediment to the provision of policy accommodation initially once conventional policy reached the elb the long delays necessitated for policymakers in nearly every jurisdiction to develop consensus and take action on unconventional policy sapped confidence tightened financial conditions and weakened recovery economic conditions in the euro area and elsewhere suffered for longer than necessary in part because of the lengthy process of building agreement to act decisively with a broader set of tools despite delays and uncertainties the balance of evidence suggests forward guidance and balance sheet policies were effective in easing financial conditions and providing accommodation following the global financial crisis 17 accordingly these tools should remain part of the committee s toolkit however the quantitative asset purchase policies that were used following the crisis proved to be lumpy both to initiate at the elb and to calibrate over the course of the recovery this lumpiness tends to create discontinuities in the provision of accommodation that can be costly to the extent that the public is uncertain about the conditions that might trigger asset purchases and how long the purchases would be sustained it undercuts the efficacy of the policy similarly significant frictions associated with the normalization process can arise as the end of the asset purchase program approaches for these reasons i have been interested in exploring approaches that expand the space for targeting interest rates in a more continuous fashion as an extension of our conventional policy space and in a way that reinforces forward guidance on the policy rate 18 in particular there may be advantages to an approach that caps interest rates on treasury securities at the short to medium range of the maturity spectrum yield curve caps in tandem with forward guidance that conditions liftoff from the elb on employment and inflation outcomes to be specific once the policy rate declines to the elb this approach would smoothly move to capping interest rates on the short to medium segment of the yield curve the yield curve ceilings would transmit additional accommodation through the longer rates that are relevant for households and businesses in a manner that is more continuous than quantitative asset purchases moreover if the horizon on the interest rate caps is set so as to reinforce forward guidance on the policy rate doing so would augment the credibility of the yield curve caps and thereby diminish concerns about an open ended balance sheet commitment in addition once the targeted outcome is achieved and the caps expire any securities that were acquired under the program would roll off organically unwinding the policy smoothly and predictably this is important as it could potentially avoid some of the tantrum dynamics that have led to premature steepening at the long end of the yield curve in several jurisdictions forward guidance on the policy rate will also be important in providing accommodation at the elb as we saw in the united states at the end of 2015 and again toward the second half of 2016 there tends to be strong pressure to normalize or lift off from the elb preemptively based on historical relationships between inflation and employment a better alternative would have been to delay liftoff until we had achieved our targets indeed recent research suggests that forward guidance that commits to delay the liftoff from the elb until full employment and 2 percent inflation have been achieved on a sustained basis say over the course of a year could improve performance on our dual mandate goals 19 to reinforce this commitment the forward guidance on the policy rate could be implemented in tandem with yield curve caps for example as the federal funds rate approaches the elb the committee could commit to refrain from lifting off the elb until full employment and 2 percent inflation are sustained for a year based on its assessment of how long this is likely take the committee would then commit to capping rates out the yield curve for a period consistent with the expected horizon of the outcome based forward guidance if the outlook shifts materially the committee could reassess how long it will take to get inflation back to 2 percent and adjust policy accordingly one benefit of this approach is that the forward guidance and the yield curve ceilings would reinforce each other the combination of a commitment to condition liftoff on the sustained achievement of our employment and inflation objectives with yield curve caps targeted at the same horizon has the potential to work well in many circumstances for very severe recessions such as the financial crisis such an approach could be augmented with purchases of 10 year treasury securities to provide further accommodation at the long end of the yield curve presumably the requisite scale of such purchases when combined with medium term yield curve ceilings and forward guidance on the policy rate would be relatively smaller than if the longer term asset purchases were used alone monetary policy and financial stability before closing it is important to recall another important lesson of the financial crisis the stability of the financial system is important to the achievement of the statutory goals of full employment and 2 percent inflation in that regard the changes in the macroeconomic environment that underlie our monetary policy review may have some implications for financial stability historically when the phillips curve was steeper inflation tended to rise as the economy heated up which prompted the federal reserve to raise interest rates in turn the interest rate increases would have the effect of tightening financial conditions more broadly with a flat phillips curve inflation does not rise as much as resource utilization tightens and interest rates are less likely to rise to restrictive levels the resulting lower for longer interest rates along with sustained high rates of resource utilization are conducive to increasing risk appetite which could prompt reach for yield behavior and incentives to take on additional debt leading to financial imbalances as an expansion extends to the extent that the combination of a low neutral rate a flat phillips curve and low underlying inflation may lead financial stability risks to become more tightly linked to the business cycle it would be preferable to use tools other than tightening monetary policy to temper the financial cycle in particular active use of macroprudential tools such as the countercyclical buffer is vital to enable monetary policy to stay focused on achieving maximum employment and average inflation of 2 percent on a sustained basis conclusion the federal reserve s commitment to adapt our monetary policy strategy to changing circumstances has enabled us to support the u s economy throughout the expansion which is now in its 11th year in light of the decline in the neutral rate low trend inflation and low sensitivity of inflation to slack as well as the consequent greater frequency of the policy rate being at the effective lower bound this is an important time to review our monetary policy strategy tools and communications in order to improve the achievement of our statutory goals i have offered some preliminary thoughts on how we could bolster inflation expectations by achieving inflation outcomes of 2 percent on average over time and when policy is constrained by the elb how we could combine forward guidance on the policy rate with caps on the short to medium segment of the yield curve to buffer the economy against adverse developments

reserve governor lael brainard said tuesday the central bank should consider capping interest rates the next time it faces an economic downturn in a speech at the new york association for business economics brainard also suggested using treasury purchases to limit the rise of short and medium term government bond yields brainard gave an upbeat near term view of the u s economy there are good reasons to expect the economy to grow at a pace modestly above potential over the next year or so supported by strong consumers and a healthy job market despite persistent uncertainty about trade conflict and disappointing foreign growth she said recent data provide some reassurance that consumer spending continues to expand at a healthy pace despite some slowing in retail sales consumer sentiment remains solid and the employment picture is positive housing seems to have turned a corner and is poised for growth following several weak quarters federal reserve board chair jerome powell took a somewhat upbeat view of the u s economy in comments made monday evening in rhode island to the greater providence chamber of commerce powell said with the jobless rate near a 50 year low of 3 6 there is plenty of room for wages to rise and for more people to join the workforce recent years data paint a hopeful picture of more people in their prime years in the workforce and wages rising for low and middle income workers powell said but this is just a start there is still plenty of room for building on these gains the fed can play a role in this effort powell said the three cuts in interest rates this year have prompted more homebuying which in turn has helped continue the economic expansion fortunately the outlook for further progress is good forecasters are generally predicting continued growth a strong job market and inflation near 2 he said for now powell added monetary policy is well positioned to support a strong labor market and return inflation decisively to our symmetric 2 objective if the outlook changes materially policy will change as well at this point in the long expansion i see the glass as much more than half full the s p corelogic case shiller u

rawan taha is having a horrible few weeks this month before her preschool students filed into the room at the daycare and education center in beirut where she works taha spotted a white piece of paper on her desk it was a letter from the school principal informing her and the entire teaching staff that their december pay might be slashed by half let s hope january will be better in order to prevent me from taking other measures the letter read taha was devastated but not surprised in recent weeks taha s friends have received similarly bad news a sudden pay cut or no pay at all in early november taha was told she would no longer be paid in u s dollars her paycheck is now paid out in lebanese pound a currency with a value that dropped by 40 percent in a one week span it s been over a month since massive protests broke out across lebanon set off by a tax on whatsapp calls and fueled by public discontent towards the lebanese government which they blame for the country s economic instability the unrest has shuttered schools banks and businesses with limited employment options available taha and her colleagues feel forced to endure these measures we don t have any alternative she said no one is hiring so we all have to just give in the protests are a result of long simmering economic anxieties from a citizenry that feels financially squeezed at every turn a huge swath of lebanese households are grappling with a crippling combination of high living costs low wages and a government so financially indebted it can t provide reliable public services in a country where the minimum wage is 400 per month baseline living costs have creeped up to levels that rival new york city which has a monthly minimum wage that is six times higher lights out again in beirut electricity is the great equalizer from the prada store on the corniche beirut s seaside promenade to the cinderblock homes of the shatila refugee camp the country s electrical grid fails them all lebanon has not had the capacity to supply 24 hour electricity since the 1975 civil war the bloody sectarian power struggle lasted 15 years and leveled much of the country s infrastructure to rubble today beirut residents get only 21 hours of electricity a day according to a 2019 world bank report most households and more than 84 percent of businesses say they pay for a private generator to supply almost half of their electrical needs the result is a doubling of the average household s electricity bill ajwad ayash lives in naameh a village just south of beirut in an october phone call ayash told the pbs newshour he pays three electric bills i pay the state electricity i pay for my private generator and i pay a bill for the community generator he said in total ayash pays about 300 a month for electricity ayash who is in his 70s moved back to lebanon with his family in 2008 after living in the u s for 25 years though he is an engineer by training he is known in naameh as an activist who led a community revolt against a massive landfill in town in 2015 after years of complaints that the landfill was making them sick ayash and other villagers physically blocked garbage trucks from entering the naameh landfill the main dumping site for beirut s garbage mounds of trash bags began to fill the streets of beirut the whole ordeal grew into a national spectacle ultimately it served as a glaring example of the government s inability to fulfill its basic function ayash said the protests playing out across lebanon today are an extension of the 2015 garbage protests as they ve come to be called what is happening right now is a reflection of the revolution on garbage as i called it back then this is a revolution against all kinds of garbage political garbage and actual waste he said rampant corruption keeps people like ayash from seeking change through official avenues he said a judge can be easily swayed for the right amount of money how can we go that far knowing that corruption is everywhere he said ayash makes a good living running his own engineering company where he maintains a core of longtime clients but even he is feeling the squeeze we get the minimum amount of electricity we have three cars at home but only use one he said we have a water reservoir to collect rainwater so we don t have to buy it and we try to stay home and not travel the relative costs of electricity also increases the farther from beirut a person lives for those living in south lebanon for example electricity costs alone eat up 12 percent of residents income even though they only get 15 hours of electricity a day the cost of connectivity it is perhaps fitting that the protests initially began around a tax on whatsapp the country s telecom industry is infamous for its expensive and what many residents consider nonsensical pricing practices lebanon s two main phone companies alfa and touch are both state run so there is little competition ali harb is a business professor at the american university of culture and education in bint jebail lebanon he said his cell phone bill alone comes out to 135 a month this gets him 2 000 minutes and 100 text messages per month since alfa and touch do not offer family plans harb s wife teenage daughter and mother in law all have their own individual cell phone bills harb s 17 year old daughter buys prepaid phone cards the preferred choice for many young people in lebanon for financial reasons but these prepaid cards have a 30 day expiration date meaning whatever is not used within 30 days from purchase disappears according to the lebanon based digital rights group smex in 2015 both alfa and touch added a ringtone charge to customers bills without their consent when customers inquired about the new charge the company required them to pay an opt out fee to get it taken off their bill the companies later eliminated the fee after smex waged a campaign against the practice in addition to the rising cost of mobile communication there is the cost and quality of lebanon s internet ookla a u s based internet analytics company ranks lebanon 164th in the world when it comes to their broadband download speed this ranks below syria ethiopia and somalia according to ookla s september global index lebanon s average broadband internet speed is 8 mpbs in the u s federal rules mandate internet speed be at least 25 mbps despite the expensive phone bills harb s biggest financial concern is another upcoming big ticket item soon his daughter will graduate from high school one college on her wish list is the american university of beirut which averages around 20 000 a year including living costs with no robust government subsidized student aid or loan program that cost will fall on harb s shoulders i try not to think about it he said with a chuckle i cannot support myself taha 31 knows she is lucky to have a job but says she simply does not make enough money to live on her own taha has worked as a preschool teacher at a private school for two years her salary is 900 a month from that taha says she spends 265 on her car payment and 130 on her cell phone bill she uses the rest to pay for food and gas but does not leave enough for her to move out of her parent s home i cannot support myself to eat to go out to do anything if i don t live with my parents we all help each other and that s the case for most lebanese people she said the unemployment rate for people taha s age under 35 is nearly 40 percent though an expensive college degree helps there are simply not enough good jobs to go around every year an average of around 20 000 individuals enter the lebanese workforce not taking into account the huge influx of syrian refugees to absorb them the economy would need to create more than six times the number of jobs it currently has to offer this is where the private sector could play a critical role but in lebanon market analysts with the world bank found that private sector job creation remains weak because investors are scared off by poor governance and the country s weak infrastructure it is estimated that up to 44 percent of lebanon s college educated population has migrated abroad many young people see leaving the country as the only way to forge their financial future one researcher looked at the job prospects of 18 to 35 year olds who emigrated from lebanon between 1992 and 2007 only 61 percent were employed in lebanon before they left once they had settled in a new country 91 percent were employed but it s now harder to emigrate than it once was the fall of oil prices has slowed hiring in the gulf and more restrictive immigration policies in the u s and europe has meant that some young people no longer have the possibility of leaving now young people realize there is no more emigration ayash said so they are saying why can t we do something about our own country to make living possible here remittances for many lebanese families the math does not add up household bills far outweigh income and this is not just in terms of individual households either the entire country is dangerously in debt lebanon s public debt is now more than 153 percent of gdp among the highest in the world this is where remittances money sent back from family members who have emigrated abroad play an integral role lebanon a small country about the size of wales has a larger inflow of remittances than any other country of similar size with one in four lebanese emigrants in the global diaspora remitting regularly the data suggests that the households receiving these remittances rely on it for more than just extra pocket money about 39 percent of these households rely on remittances to finance primary school education 24 percent rely on them to pay for medication the government itself is also increasingly reliant on the large bank deposits from wealthy investors abroad to bring in a new dollars into the country but the demonstrations have rattled some investors who fear a bank run could collapse the country s entire banking system no easy way out after a month of paralyzing protests the political crisis is still at an impasse and the economic crisis is only escalating atms all over lebanon are inaccessible bank employees who are now often tasked with telling people they cannot withdraw their money have demanded that they be provided with security to protect them from a wall of furious customers protestors have demanded a wholecloth changed in the country s political leadership but the problem is it is unclear who can or even wants to take the reigns from there lebanon s prime minister saad hariri resigned nearly a month ago in response to the large scale anti government protests but stayed on in a caretaker capacity until the selection of a new prime minister a post reserved for a sunni muslim under lebanon s sectarian power sharing system earlier this month the business tycoon and former finance minister mohammed safadi who emerged as a hariri s possible replacement was rejected by protestors who viewed him as a member of the ruling elite he withdrew his candidacy saying it would be too difficult to form a government taha believes the protests will continue until they get the changes they are demanding people have nothing to lose they re losing their jobs they don t have money their salaries are being cut we already don t have electricity we don t have water we don t have sanitation we don t have anything she said

groups are finding in june 2019 the imf endorsed investment in resilience building by disaster prone nations citing lower expected losses improved economic performance and better continuity of public services it acknowledged however that many vulnerable countries are likely to find such investments unaffordable according to the united nations environment programme the costs of adapting to climate change in developing economies may range from 56 billion to 300 billion by 2030 or two to three times the currently available funding and yet according to imf economists investing in resilience may cut the costs of postdisaster intervention by at least half it s a case that international organizations are making to donor groups and nations never let a good crisis go to waste writes former rockefeller foundation president judith rodin in her 2014 book the resilience dividend rodin continues to advocate adaptation to climate change disasters help get people s attention she says in an interview before this concept was fully developed people didn t tend to rebuild resiliently everywhere it s the poor and vulnerable who get hit the hardest whether they live on an island or in a city in march 2019 tropical cyclone idai blasted malawi mozambique and zimbabwe with days of high winds and heavy rains killing more than 1 300 people a month later tropical cyclone kenneth hit some of the same areas and compounded the devastation bringing total damages from the two storms to 4 billion it was the first instance on record of such sequential disasters in a single season and left almost 3 million people without housing electricity or running water more than 800 000 hectares of crops were wiped out malawi is one of the least developed countries in the world and also one of the countries hardest hit by climate change says pritha mitra the imf s mission chief for malawi we are looking at adapting to climate change and whether it s actually an opportunity to not only boost growth but also reduce inequality in sub saharan african countries the people who are most affected by climate change are the poorer households so climate change is exacerbating already large inequalities in the cyclones aftermath the african development bank approved a 100 million four year grant program that would directly benefit 1 million people across the three countries the project includes measures to improve agricultural productivity and resilience by upgrading irrigation systems and livestock practices in addition it envisions making infrastructure such as roads electrical grids water supplies and sanitation systems more resistant to big storms the program will also enhance early warning systems and institutional and community capacity to respond to disasters farmers and remote households in places like malawi depend on mobile phone services for early warning of weather events planning what crops to plant and gaining access to financing mitra says so strengthening telecommunications systems to withstand catastrophic storms is important for building resilience she observes these countries can t necessarily do it all on their own mitra says these are poor countries as the disasters become bigger and more frequent and thus more costly for all the various donor countries and international organizations perhaps it is going to be cheaper if we all help with building resilience up front that s a major takeaway from a 2019 working paper by imf economists alessandro cantelmo giovanni melina and chris papageorgiou these researchers rank countries by probability of sustaining a natural disaster based on 20 years of data through 2017 they identify the 34 most disaster prone nations and find that they are mostly small or low income countries in the pacific or the caribbean with the marshall islands st vincent and the grenadines tuvalu micronesia and st lucia at the top of the list the study shows that natural disasters such as droughts floods and storms can often cause damages totaling 50 percent of a country s gdp with indications that frequency and size of catastrophes have risen over the past 20 years the costs of hurricane ivan for grenada in 2004 amounted to 148 percent of gdp and those of hurricane maria for dominica in 2017 reached 260 percent reflecting the relatively small size of the countries economies small nations can t just bounce back from calamities on that scale on average the economies of disaster prone countries grow by 1 percent less each year than those of non disaster prone countries because major resources have to be diverted to recovery from such calamities the researchers find climate change may triple that growth gap the study shows as their economies stagnate and revenues decline disaster prone nations carry significantly higher public debt than non disaster prone countries the researchers have developed a complex economic model to compare the effects of investing in resilience with those of simply providing disaster relief it shows that disaster prone countries would benefit only modestly by self financing the higher costs of adaptation international aid is crucial they write if forthcoming such help in paying for resilient infrastructure can yield dramatic results the economists find to eliminate the welfare losses from natural disasters via grants that finance the extra cost of resilient infrastructure donors would have to disburse less than half the amount required to finance post disaster intervention the study shows other recent imf work in caribbean nations has shown that investing in structural resilience would increase potential economic output by 3 11 percent with a growth dividend of 0 1 0 4 percent a year the imf has outlined a three legged approach to disaster resilience that is consistent with maintaining fiscal sustainability countries need to get their fiscal houses in order with supportive funding from the international community because of the scale of the costs involved the first element of the approach is structural adaptation such as strengthened roads bridges telecommunications water supplies and sanitation systems the tiny caribbean island of dominica with a population of 74 000 was devastated by tropical systems in 2015 and 2017 damages the first time equaled the country s gdp and the second time amounted to twice its gdp under an imf pilot program dominica s government is developing a plan to improve the resilience of the nation s infrastructure by 2030 but doing so in a fiscally sustainable way will require donor aid totaling 200 million the imf estimates a second leg is postdisaster and social resilience such as contingency planning and related investments to ensure an efficient disaster response with minimal disruption to public services such as those for sheltering people and knowing where to direct relief for example following a 2016 cyclone mozambique created a social registry for use in distributing supplies after a disaster while investing in stronger schoolhouses that function as community shelters says imf african department adviser marshall mills the third pillar and really the central one is creating financial resilience in advance of disasters according to uma ramakrishnan an assistant director in the imf s western hemisphere department and a lead author of the imf s paper on building resilience in disaster prone developing nations her portfolio includes the bahamas barbados and jamaica she cites a recent six and a half year imf project in which jamaica put tremendous effort into strengthening its finances so that major external shocks including a major storm won t irreversibly damage the nation s fiscal capacity over nearly 300 years of recorded history jamaica has weathered dozens of hurricanes including 17 named storms since 1951 usually causing flooding fatalities and economic devastation as a first layer of financial resilience jamaica has been pouring money into a contingency fund to provide ready cash in the event of a disaster the fund has reached about j 2 billion 15 million according to ramakrishnan a second is arranging standby financing for catastrophes in the form of a 285 million credit line from the inter american development bank and a third is arranging disaster insurance through various risk transfer mechanisms including the caribbean catastrophe risk insurance facility and a possible market based instrument such as a catastrophe bond although details regarding the instrument aren t fully public there is more to be done in jamaica on structural and social resilience and that will come next ramakrishnan says in jamaica they always say they are just one hurricane away from all their economic gains being wiped out

brazil russia india china and south africa or the brics economic bloc are engaging in discussions to issue cross national digital money in order to reduce the dependence of their economies on the united states as reported by cointelegraph on nov 14 what will the new cryptocurrency look like how does the brics group plan to use it and are there any existing projects underway that seek to achieve a similar goal of independence on such a high level brics and its problems brics is the largest geopolitical block of countries spanning three continents and wielding substantial economic power in global affairs as of 2018 the five nations of the brics block had a combined nominal gross domestic product of 40 trillion or about 23 2 of the gross world product however such economic power does not come without competitive penchants from other nations that are vying for the markets that brics nations cater to the greatest competition comes from the european union and the u s the political experience of recent years has shown that brics countries diplomacy has arguably failed in alleviating international sanctions especially in politically sensitive markets such as the arms and the energy carriers markets however advances in technology are here to help out where politics cannot as blockchain and digital assets have the potential to open entirely new horizons for finance the idea of a single cryptocurrency as a means of payments and value transmission is not a new one but it is one that is being actively purported not only in countries like venezuela with its petro but also among brics countries the advantages of a single cryptocurrency as a universal means of settlements among brics nations would solve many of the problems they face on the global economic market a means of circumventing u s sanctions the brics business council discussed creating a common cryptocurrency as a potential solution to these problems during the 11th brics summit that was held in brazil on nov 13 14 according to reports that cite kirill dmitriev a member of the council dmitriev who is the director general of the russian direct investment fund went on to say that an efficient brics payment system could be used to stimulate settlements between the countries while reducing the use of the u s dollar for these purposes it was also reported that the new system may become an alternative to the international payment mechanism swift to facilitate trade with countries under u s sanctions dmitriev also noted that in recent years the share of u s dollars payments made between the brics countries has significantly decreased in russia for example over the past five years the share of usd in foreign trade transactions fell from 92 to 50 while those made in the russian ruble rose from 3 to 14 at the same time the potential for reducing the u s dollar s dominance is still great according to macroeconomic analyst oleg dushin who told russian media outlet bfm that such could be the case if russia and india changed the currency they use to make payments between each other dushin also said that russia and china have already stopped using u s dollars in half of their mutual settlements and that there is currently a general trend of driving the dollar out of the international payments system this according to the expert will help brics countries weaken the influence of the dollar in the global monetary system and reduce the risk of payments being frozen by washington denis smirnov a blockchain consultant from russia noted to bfm the convenience and reduction of transaction costs as some of the advantages of creating a single cryptocurrency system for the brics countries calling it an alternative to bonds commenting on the possibility of brics countries using a single cryptocurrency vladimir rozhankovsky an expert at the international financial center told bfm if it is possible to reduce currency risks then it is better to carry out trading payments directly and not through the purchase of dollars this is obvious the vast majority of more or less large global economies are now working on this issue peg to gold not the u s dollar while it is still unknown what the brics cryptocurrency will look like exactly experts are discussing what it could potentially be tied to commenting on the possible options that the international cryptocurrency may be tied elina sidorenko the head of the russian state duma s working group on cryptocurrency issues said that there are several options on the table for example it could be tied to the value of another cryptocurrency she told russian media outlet dp but in this case it s impossible to avoid either the continuation of the u s dollar s monopoly or it can be pegged to the price of a raw material or a good but then the risk of market manipulation becomes a threat she concluded the thirasd option is a link to gold and taking into account the latest basel accords such a decision seems very convincing and timely olinga taeed a council member and expert advisor at the china e commerce blockchain committee told cointelegraph that the chinese have been researching the possibility of issuing a gold backed token due to the country s access to natural mineral reserves in africa through china s belt and road initiative he went on to add more recently frictionless international trade has come to the fore with dlt looked upon as a possible solution for brexit for example replacing the usual 5 10 year gestation period so the thinking is well rehearsed but what is new here is the willingness to enact it and for evidence of this there is absolute clarity trump has made transparent the long established use of the financial instrument of the dollar to pressurise iran russia china etc for non financial gain russia seeks an alternative to swift russia has been the target of sanctions since 2014 as a result of multiple economic restrictions russian authorities have been considering the possibility of creating alternatives to swift one of them the system for transfer of financial messages or sfps is reportedly being used in 18 of money transfers in the country and foreign financial organizations began to join spfs in 2018 however in april russian finance minister anton siluanov noted that spfs is not a full fledged replacement for swift and that it is unlikely to become one in the near future now the russian government is considering another alternative a national cryptocurrency secured by gold elvira nabiullina head of the central bank of russia said that such a currency could be used to carry out settlements with other countries for trade transactions however nabiullina is also of the opinion that it is more important to develop international settlements facilitated by national currencies rather than crypto the sanctions had blocked at least 20 of russia s defense transactions in 2018 due their tether to the u s dollar though russian authorities are gradually moving toward settlements in national currencies with brics states the idea of a unified cryptocurrency is being openly discussed as an effective transparent untraceable and stable instrument for circumventing u s sanctions and decreasing dependence on the u s dollar brics states would be able to disregard any exchange rate differences in settlements in a single cryptocurrency and russia would gain solid support for its national currency the ruble which suffered a twofold drop in value china considering a national crypto to bypass u s sanctions china is the leading nation of the brics bloc in terms of gdp and the most open nation when it comes to discussions about blockchain implementation china is intent on accelerating the development of its own central bank backed digital currency and is working toward the integration of blockchain technologies into other important financial mainstays of the country such as alibaba tencent and various banking institutions such hasty development could in part be the result of a heated debates about facebook s libra coin chinese analysts fear that the development of a global digital currency by a company which is regarded to have strong affiliations with the u s would threaten the existence of national currencies and weaken their exchange rates such a stablecoin backed by the u s dollar may increase the power of its penetration into the global economy and thus solidify the political positions of washington chinese authorities are interested not only in the development of a unified cryptocurrency for settlements with brics countries but also in the launch of a national cryptocurrency that would serve as a shield against the economic adversary across the pacific brazil has a positive stance on using stablecoins brazil is demonstrating the highest rate of bitcoin btc trade in latin america such broad penetration of digital assets in brazil makes it both fertile ground for the development of a national cryptocurrency and firm ground to support for a unified brics cryptocurrency for settlements with member states given the country s positive stance toward blockchain brazilian authorities seem to be open to discussions with stablecoin issuers one recent example is that of the mile unity foundation whose representatives met with members of brazil s ministry of industry foreign trade and services to discuss the use of the xdr stablecoin for international transfers of funds given that brazil had an export import balance of 219 billion to 140 billion in 2017 alone the potential for using a single cryptocurrency with brics member states for increasing such figures is immense although brazil does not suffer from sanctions its main trade partners in technology such as russia are subject to them using the u s dollar for mutual settlements between countries leaves little room to maneuver india is fighting with poverty and corruption the indian authorities are reportedly discussing the introduction of a national digital currency there may be significant reasons for such a move not the least of which being the alleviation of the poverty that many of the country s 1 3 billion are languishing in the reserve bank of india is pushing for such a digital currency backed and regulated by the central bank as legal tender the rbi hopes that blockchain can alleviate the issue with corruption which is rampant in india and significantly reduce the dependence of millions of indians working abroad on financial intermediaries in cross border transfers the indian authorities are also proponents of a national digital currency for reducing the population s reliance on other digital currencies given india s stance within brics as a major buyer of russian arms and as one of the most important energy trade partners having mutual settlements in a unified digital currency would open up entirely new prospects for trading south africa is making money transfers accessible for citizens the possibility of issuing a national digital currency has even been discussed by the south african reserve bank which could allow for its citizens to freely transact without the need for banks given the staggering number of unbanked individuals estimated to be around 11 million people and those without any form of official ids in the country the availability of a national digital currency would help millions of citizens gain access to financial services and boost economic development south africa is just as bound to the u s dollar as all the other brics members in its settlements with china and russia meaning that is also feels the impact of the sanctions regime experts say according to experts the idea of creating a digital currency for brics may turn out to be highly viable given the transition of the world from a monopolar political model to a multipolar one and the backdrop of a shift in the economy from traditional financial institutions to trading platforms and the main beneficiary so far could be china which is interested in expanding its sales markets amid a trade war with the u s smirnov told bfm that he believes that over time such systems will become more widespread for example for the past two or more years a consortium of several european banks has been testing its own mutual settlement solution that works outside the swift system and allows for interbank settlements the individual national currencies of the brics countries have been dropping against the u s dollar over the past 10 20 years but it is unclear whether a unified brics payment system would reverse this trend however it is possible that the u s dollar could be weakened if the share of settlements in dollars significantly decreases around the world among other possible risks that may be associated with the idea of issuing a gold pegged international digital currency head of research at investment company nord capital vladimir rojankovsky noted the deregulation of the market and the possibility of manipulation he told russian media outlet regnum such an implementation of this project does not imply the involvement of any distinguished party which is a living oversight body speaking about the further development of the brics initiative teemo puutio an expert in compliance and an adjunct instructor at new york university school of professional services told cointelegraph

flying in the face of negative economic news u s factories picked up steam for the third straight month in november the preliminary manufacturing purchasing manager s index pmi a leading indicator we closely track here at u s global investors pulled further away from its august low with a reading of 52 2 this month that s up from 51 3 in october and marks a seven month high remember investors are better served when they follow the trend lines not the headlines a raft of economic reports on friday welcomed the turnaround chris williamson chief economist at ihs markit which releases the monthly pmi wrote that the november reading adds to evidence that the worst of the economy s recent soft patch may be behind us responding to the manufacturing uptrend renaissance macro s head of economics neil dutta urged investors to look for construction activity to rise today s improvement wrote cornerstone macro s nancy lazar shows u s manufacturing is recovering as trade uncertainty recedes finally stan shipley at evercore isi said that friday s improved pmi and consumer sentiment releases suggest solid employment and consumer spending will pull the manufacturing sector higher rather than the manufacturing sector dragging the overall economy lower taken together this is all very constructive not just for manufacturers but also exporters container shipping companies and cargo airlines not to mention the energy materials and financial sectors the boeing co for instance announced a bump in orders for its still grounded 737 max aircraft following this year s dubai airshow the world s largest aerospace event boeing reported that kazakhstan s air astana had committed itself to as many as 30 max jets while an undisclosed buyer ordered 20 this comes after sunexpress a turkish leisure carrier purchased 10 bringing the total value of max sales to 7 5 billion negative headlines may get the clicks but savvy investors who can look past those headlines and follow the money often get the rewards global debt expected to hit a new record amount although the pmi report is encouraging there s still reason to remain somewhat cautious long term the latest accounting of global debt levels was just released and the news might be so bad that it s good for gold prices at least after climbing above 250 trillion in the first half of 2019 the amount of debt that s owed by governments the financial sector and non financial sector is now forecast to touch a record 255 trillion by year s end according to the washington d c based institute of international finance iif says iif economists this mind boggling sum is the equivalent of 320 percent of total global economic activity the highest level ever to put it another way for every 1 that s produced today an additional 3 20 in debt is created and thrown atop the heap i shouldn t need to say it but i will anyway this is unsustainable as economist martin murenbeeld writes in his most recent gold monitor newsletter rising global debt levels is one of our most important medium long term factors in the gold outlook that s because debt inhibits growth murenbeeld says and high debt levels will when central banks are committed to targeting maximum employment and stable inflation limit central banks policy options to loose or very loose all this will be very positive for gold of course he adds 7 trillion in unfunded u s pension liabilities here in the u s national debt hit an unimaginable 23 trillion on october 31 halloween day of all days that s roughly 107 percent of u s gross domestic product gdp or nearly double its share of the economy from 2000 this data comes from u s national debt clock which i highly recommend you visit if you haven t already done so it s an invaluable tool what i find particularly eye opening is the amount of unfunded public pension liabilities they re currently closing in on 7 trillion the equivalent of 20 700 per u s citizen an unfunded pension is any retirement plan for which sufficient assets have not been set aside and as murenbeeld points out such obligations can inhibit economic growth the greater they become the more tax revenues must go not toward infrastructure education and other public benefits but to fixed costs it should come as no surprise to you that the u s city facing the biggest shortfall at the moment is chicago illinois about a third of the windy city s budget is earmarked for pension payments alone and when you combine other obligations such as debt service and other postemployment benefits opebs fixed costs amount to 45 percent of expenditures back in july 2017 i discussed the illinois budget crisis at length and since then not much has improved despite state and city leaders best efforts in fiscal year 2019 illinois taxpayers contributed a record 10 billion toward the state s unfunded pension liabilities and yet it still wasn t enough to prevent them from growing from 131 billion in 2018 to 137 billion this year unfunded chicago pensions have also deepened further into deficit in the four years since former mayor rahm emanuel s series of painful tax hikes on everything from property to water services to 911 emergency lines according to a chicago tribune investigation city pension debt has ballooned to 7 billion since the new taxes went into effect in 2015 time to replace bonds wgc says maybe my reason

basis non gaap total operating expense non gaap operating margin non gaap tax rate non gaap net earnings non gaap diluted net eps free cash flow gross cash and net cash debt hp also provides forecasts of non gaap diluted net eps and free cash flow these non gaap financial measures are not computed in accordance with or as an alternative to gaap in the united states reconciliations of these non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures are included in the tables above or elsewhere in the materials accompanying this news release use and economic substance of non gaap financial measures net revenue on a constant currency basis excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations calculated by translating current period revenues using monthly average exchange rates from the comparative period and excluding any hedging impact recognized in the current period non gaap operating margin is defined to exclude the effects of any amounts relating to restructuring and other charges acquisition related charges and amortization of intangible assets non gaap net earnings and non gaap diluted net eps consist of net earnings or diluted net eps excluding those same charges defined benefit plan settlement charges non operating retirement related credits charges debt extinguishment cost tax adjustments and the amount of additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each non gaap item hp s management uses these non gaap financial measures for purposes of evaluating hp s historical and prospective financial performance as well as hp s performance relative to its competitors hp s management also uses these non gaap measures to further its own understanding of hp s segment operating performance hp believes that excluding the items mentioned above for these non gaap financial measures allows hp s management to better understand hp s consolidated financial performance in relation to the operating results of hp s segments as hp s management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results more specifically hp s management excludes each of those items mentioned above for the following reasons restructuring and other charges are i costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to employee termination and early retirement costs and related benefits costs of real estate consolidation and other non labor charges and ii other charges which include non recurring costs that are distinct from ongoing operational costs hp excludes these restructuring and other charges and any reversals of charges recorded in prior periods for purposes of calculating these non gaap measures because hp believes that these costs do not reflect expected future operating expenses and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of hp s current operating performance or comparisons to hp s operating performance in other periods hp incurs cost related to its acquisitions which it would not have otherwise incurred as part of its operations the charges are direct expenses such as third party professional and legal fees and integration related costs as well as non cash adjustments to the fair value of certain acquired assets such as inventory these charges related to acquisitions are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of hp s acquisitions hp believes that eliminating such expenses for purposes of calculating these non gaap measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of hp s current operating performance and comparisons to hp s past operating performance in other periods hp incurs charges relating to the amortization of intangible assets those charges are included in hp s gaap earnings operating margin net earnings and diluted net eps such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of hp s acquisitions and any related impairment charges consequently hp excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non gaap measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of hp s current operating performance and comparisons to hp s operating performance in other periods non operating retirement related credits charges includes certain market related factors such as interest cost expected return on plan assets amortized actuarial gains or losses and impacts from other market related factors associated with hp s defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans the market driven retirement related adjustments are primarily due to the changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and hp considers these adjustments to be outside the operational performance of the business non operating retirement related credits charges also include certain plan curtailments settlements and special termination benefits related to hp s defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans hp believes that eliminating such adjustments for purposes of calculating non gaap measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of hp s current operating performance and comparisons to hp s operating performance in other periods hp incurred defined benefit plan settlement charges relating to the u s hp pension plan the charges are associated with the net settlement and remeasurement resulting from voluntary lump sum payments offered to certain terminated vested participants hp excludes these charges for the purposes of calculating these non gaap measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of hp s current operating performance and comparisons to hp s operating performance in other periods hp incurred debt extinguishment costs related to the march 2018 repurchase of certain of its outstanding u s dollar global notes these costs primarily included bond repurchase premiums and losses from fair value hedges hp excludes these costs for the purposes of calculating these non gaap measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of hp s current operating performance and comparisons to hp s operating performance in other periods tax adjustments include u s tax reform adjustment and net tax indemnification amounts hp recorded u s tax reform adjustment as one time charges relating to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 these charges encompass several elements including the reversal of previously accrued taxes on unrepatriated overseas profits a one time transition tax on accumulated overseas profits and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new u s tax rate hp has completed the accounting for the tax effects of the tax cuts and jobs act within the one year measurement period however additional guidance issued by regulators and new positions taken or elections made by hp may materially impact the income tax expense and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made as a part of the separation of hewlett packard enterprise company from hp inc the separation hp evaluates all tax uncertain positions to determine the indemnification amounts under the tax matters agreement with hewlett packard enterprise and records the adjustments as net tax indemnifications amounts in the current quarter hp entered into a settlement agreement with hewlett packard enterprise to terminate the tax matters agreement as part of this settlement hp and hewlett packard enterprise agreed to release each other from certain future claims and liabilities arising out of or related to the tax matters agreement hp recorded a one time net indemnification and tax adjustments for the quarter related to this settlement hp also recorded other tax adjustment including tax benefits and expenses related to the realizability of certain deferred tax assets various tax rate and regulatory changes and tax settlements across various jurisdictions hp excludes these adjustments for the purposes of calculating these non gaap measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of hp s current operating performance and comparisons to hp s operating performance in other periods free cash flow is a non gaap measure that is defined as cash flow from operations less the net of investments in and proceeds from sales of property plant and equipment gross cash is a non gaap measure that is defined as cash and cash equivalents plus short term investments and certain long term investments that may be liquidated within 90 days pursuant to the terms of existing put options or similar rights hp s management uses free cash flow and gross cash for the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for investment in hp s businesses repurchasing stock and other purposes hp s management also uses free cash flow and gross cash to evaluate hp s historical and prospective liquidity because gross cash includes liquid assets that are not included in cash and cash equivalents hp believes that gross cash provides a helpful assessment of hp s liquidity because free cash flow includes the effect of investment in and proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment that are not reflected in net cash provided by operating activities hp believes that free cash flow provides a more accurate and complete assessment of hp s liquidity and capital resources net cash debt is defined as gross cash less gross debt after adjusting the effect of unamortized premium discount on debt issuance debt issuance costs and unrealized gains losses on fair value hedges and interest rate swaps material limitations associated with use of non gaap financial measures these non gaap financial measures may have limitations as analytical tools and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of hp s results as reported under gaap some of the limitations in relying on these non gaap financial measures are items such as amortization of intangible assets though not directly affecting hp s cash position represent the loss in value of intangible assets over time the expense associated with this change in value is not included in non gaap operating margin non gaap net earnings and non gaap diluted net eps and therefore does not reflect the full economic effect of the change in value of those intangible assets items such as restructuring and other charges acquisition related charges non operating retirement related credits charges defined benefit plan settlement charges debt extinguishment costs and tax adjustments that are excluded from non gaap operating margin non gaap net earnings and non gaap diluted net eps can have a material impact on the equivalent gaap earnings measure and cash flows hp may not be able to immediately liquidate the short term and certain long term investments included in gross cash which may limit the usefulness of gross cash as a liquidity measure other companies may calculate the non gaap financial measures differently than hp limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes compensation for limitations associated with use of non gaap financial measures hp compensates for the limitations on its use of non gaap financial measures by relying primarily on its gaap results and using non gaap financial measures only supplementally hp also provides robust and detailed reconciliations of each non gaap financial measure to its most directly comparable gaap measure within this news release and in other written materials that include these non gaap financial measures and hp encourages investors to review those reconciliations carefully usefulness of non gaap financial measures to investors hp believes that providing net revenue on a constant currency basis non gaap total operating expense non gaap operating profit non gaap operating margin non gaap tax rate non gaap net earnings non gaap diluted net eps free cash flow gross cash and net cash debt to investors in addition to the related gaap financial measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by hp s management in its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see hp s results through the eyes of management hp further believes that providing this information better enables hp s investors to understand hp s operating performance and financial condition and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by hp s management to evaluate and measure such performance and financial condition disclosure of these non gaap financial measures also facilitates comparisons of hp s operating performance with the performance of other companies in hp s industry that supplement their gaap results with non gaap financial measures that may be calculated in a similar manner editorial contacts hp inc media relations mediarelations hp com

owing to a recent easing of both sino american tensions and monetary policies many investors seem to be betting on another era of expansion for the global economy but they would do well to remember that the fundamental risks to growth remain and are actually getting worse new york this past may and august escalations in the trade and technology conflict between the united states and china rattled stock markets and pushed bond yields to historic lows but that was then since then financial markets have once again become giddy u s and other equities are trending toward new highs and there is even talk of a potential melt up in equity values the financial market buzz has seized on the possibility of a reflation trade in the hope that the recent global slowdown will be followed in 2020 by accelerating growth and firmer inflation which helps profits and risky assets the sudden shift from risk off to risk on reflects four positive developments first the u s and china are likely to reach a phase one deal that would at least temporarily halt any further escalation of their trade and technology war second despite the uncertainty surrounding the united kingdom s election on december 12 prime minister boris johnson has at least managed to secure a tentative soft brexit deal with the eu and the chances of the uk crashing out of the bloc have been substantially reduced third the u s has demonstrated restraint in the face of iranian provocations in the middle east with president donald trump realizing that surgical strikes against that country could result in a full scale war and severe oil price spike and lastly the u s federal reserve the european central bank and other major central banks have gotten ahead of geopolitical headwinds by easing monetary policies with central banks once again coming to the rescue even minor green shoots such as the stabilization of the u s manufacturing sector and the resilience of services and consumption growth have been taken as a harbinger of renewed global expansion yet there is much to suggest that not all is well with the global economy for starters recent data from china germany and japan suggest that the slowdown is still ongoing even if its pace has become less severe second while the u s and china may agree to a truce the ongoing decoupling of the world s two largest economies will almost certainly accelerate again after the u s election next november in the medium to long term the best one can hope for is that the looming cold war will not turn hot third while china has shown restraint in confronting the popular uprising in hong kong the situation in the city is worsening making a forceful crackdown likely in 2020 among other things a militarized chinese response could derail any trade deal with the u s and shock financial markets as well as push taiwan in the direction of forces supporting independence a red line for beijing fourth although a hard brexit may be off the table the eurozone is experiencing a deepening malaise that is not related to the uk s impending departure germany and other countries with fiscal space continue to resist demands for stimulus worse the ecb s new president christine lagarde will most likely be unable to provide much more in the way of monetary policy stimulus given that one third of the ecb governing council already opposes the current round of easing beyond challenges stemming from an aging population weakening chinese demand and the costs of meeting new emissions standards europe also remains vulnerable to trump s oft repeated threat to impose import tariffs on german and other european cars and key european economies not least germany spain france and italy are experiencing political ructions that could translate into economic trouble fifth with crippling u s led sanctions now fueling street riots the iranian regime will see no other choice but to continue fomenting instability in the wider region in order to raise the costs of america s current approach the middle east is already in turmoil massive protests have erupted in iraq and lebanon a country that is effectively bankrupt and at risk of a currency sovereign debt and banking crisis in the current political vacuum there the iranian backed hezbollah could decide to attack israel turkey s incursion into syria has introduced many new risks including to the supply of oil from iraqi kurdistan yemen s civil war has no end in sight and israel is currently without a government the region is a powder keg an explosion could trigger an oil shock and a renewed risk off episode sixth central banks are reaching the limits of what they can do to backstop the economy and fiscal policy remains constrained by politics and high debts to be sure policymakers could turn to even more unconventional policies namely monetized fiscal deficits whenever another downturn occurs but they will not do so until the next crisis is already severe seventh the populist backlash against globalization trade migration and technology is worsening in many places in a race to the bottom more countries may pursue policies to restrict the movement of goods capital labor technology and data while recent mass protests in bolivia chile ecuador egypt france spain hong kong indonesia iraq iran and lebanon reflect a variety of causes all are experiencing economic malaise and rising political resentment over inequality and other issues eighth the u s under trump may become the biggest source of uncertainty trump s america first trade foreign policies risk destroying the international order that the u s and its allies created after wwii some in europe like french president emmanuel macron worry that nato is now comatose while the u s is provoking rather than supporting its asian allies such as japan and south korea at home the impeachment process will lead to even more bipartisan gridlock and warfare and some democrats running for the party nomination have policy platforms that are making financial markets nervous finally medium term trends may cause still more economic damage and disruption demographic aging in advanced economies and emerging markets will inevitably reduce potential growth and restrictions on migration will make the problem worse climate change is already causing costly economic damage as extreme weather events become more frequent virulent and destructive and while technological innovation may expand the size of the economic pie in the long run artificial intelligence and automation will first disrupt jobs firms and entire industries exacerbating already high levels of inequality whenever the next severe downturn occurs high and rising private and public debts will prove unsustainable triggering a wave of disorderly defaults and bankruptcies the disconnect between financial markets and the real economy is becoming more pronounced investors are happily focusing on the attenuation of some short term tail risks and on central banks return to monetary policy easing but the fundamental risks to the global economy remain in fact from a medium term perspective they are actually getting worse nouriel roubini professor of economics at new york university s stern school of business and chairman of roubini macro associates was senior economist for international affairs in the white house s council of

source imgflip due to reader requests i ve decided to break up my weekly best dividend stocks to buy this week series into two parts one will be the weekly watch list article with the best ideas for new money at any given time the other will be a portfolio update to also make those more digestible i m breaking out the intro for the weekly series into a revised introduction and reference article on the 3 rules for using margin safely and profitably which will no longer be included in those future articles to minimize reader confusion i will be providing portfolio updates on a rotating tri weekly schedule this means an update every three weeks on the trade deal soap opera continues source ycharts since the august trade deal swoon stocks are up 10 with trade sensitive names like apple aapl up three times that amount following the handshake phase one trade deal agreement in october that avoided new tariffs china and the us have been talking frequently and trying to hammer out a written agreement to avoid the 15 tariffs on 160 billion in technology and apparel that s scheduled for december 15th larry kudlow says we re getting close to a deal but we were 90 of the way to a deal back in may when things fell apart china says talks are constructive but according to reuters a so called phase one agreement between the u s and china may not be completed until next year as beijing presses for greater reductions in tariffs and washington pushes back with its own increased demands china wants september 1st tariffs 15 on 110 billion worth of mostly apparel eliminated in exchange for buying up to 50 billion per year in more us agricultural goods talks seem to be progressing but there is always the risk they could fall apart again if we don t make a deal with china i ll just raise the tariffs even higher they d like to have a rollback i haven t agreed to anything president trump moody s analytics considers an escalation of the trade conflict to be the biggest risk factor that could tip the us into a mild recession as things stand now we can t be sure whether or not those december 15th tariffs will go up or be postponed in yet another tariff truce of which we ve seen several since the tariff conflict began in early 2018 ceos and cfos are increasingly pessimistic which isn t good since they are ones helping keep the economy afloat via a strong job market according to the conference board a leading supplier of leading economic indicator data only 4 of ceos surveyed believe the economy would improve in the next several months while two thirds saw it getting worse john graham a finance professor at duke university s fuqua school of business and director of the duke cfo optimism survey found that business optimism has not been this low since september 2016 a time when the unemployment rate was 5 percent optimism is low in all regions of the world which exacerbates any slowdown occurring in the u s duke university the new york fed s real time gdp model appears to be stabilizing though still shows very slow growth for q4 source new york federal reserve so that tears it then it s best to sell all your stocks or at least not buy new ones right not at all source james picerno jeff miller the median consensus on gdp is that we ll grow 1 5 in q4 q1 2020 is expected to see growth slow to 1 3 but then rebound for the rest of the year which is expected to bring us 1 5 growth in 2020 source marketwatch is that slow growth you bet the slowest since 2009 in fact but morgan stanley thinks growth next year will be stronger 1 8 and goldman sachs is even more bullish expecting a phase one deal in early 2020 to result in 2 3 gdp growth according to jan hatzius goldman s chief economist this easing in financial conditions suggests not only that global growth is likely to pick up somewhat in absolute terms but also that growth may come in stronger than currently predicted by the forecaster community goldman s proprietary economic model forecasts 2 3 growth in 2020 for the us and 3 4 global growth the second worst thing you can do is not steadily investing new money into quality companies at reasonable to attractive valuations the worst thing you can do is sell your stocks based on the doomsday predictions of famous permabears source jeff miller note that even shifting money out of stocks and into safe bonds on the predictions of imminent market crashes could have resulted in a 60 decline in your portfolio those who shorted the market like john hussman well he s down 7 cagr over the past decade underperforming the broader

total returns over the last 20 years when the s p 500 has delivered 5 6 annualized returns and even market timing retail investors who avoided shorting beat this famous hedge fund manager by 2 cagr over half an investing lifetime i get that periods of high uncertainty bother most people pullbacks and corrections of which we historically have one every six months are not fun while they last but guess what the average pullback of 5 to 9 9 since wwii has lasted just one month with a peak decline of 7 the typical correction is a 14 slide for stocks that lasts for five months but within four months of the bottom we re back to all time highs source jill mislinski the longest bull market in us history has seen 20 pullbacks and corrections each time investors worried that it was the start of the big one another 2007 2009 style crash buffett calls investing steadily over time betting on america and he s right about that 84 of the time the us economy is growing and since 1950 the stock market goes up in 82 of years 75 since 1926 including the great depression 90 crash i personally invest 750 per week each and every week no matter what the broader market is doing or what worries have financial media pundits all hot and bothered i don t invest in the broader market mind you because the s p 500 s paltry 1 8 yield and 10 overvaluation is far inferior to the alternatives that the

portfolio 1 spg outside of the financial crisis simon has tended to be a very defensive stock especially when it started out historically undervalued at the start of the tech crash of 2000 spg was about 45 undervalued and its peak decline including dividends during that multi year bear market was 13 if you want further evidence of simon s defensiveness consider the 19 8 correction we saw in late 2018 simon started that severe correction at a p ffo of 12 9 and its forward p ffo is now 11 6 spg epd frt cl and dividend aristocrats during the worst correction in a decade source ycharts from a 10 higher valuation than it sits at now spg fell 9 less than the broader market and 5 less than the dividend aristocrats in fact all four of these super swans acted defensively meaning they

ones under consideration could result in about 1 2 billion per year in annual growth spending 7 to 8 cash yields is what spg is generating on its investments meaning that organic growth potential from backlogs alone is 2 2 to 2 5 to that you can add about 2 long term noi growth analysts expect over the next decade the power of the best lease spreads in the industry 22 last quarter that leaves spg with total organic growth potential of 4 2 to 4 5 to which it can add strategic m a including overseas investments and 1 to 2 worth of buyback fueled growth this means that spg s realistic growth range is from 4 to 8 which should justify its historical valuations what does that mean for simon s return potential at the best valuation in 10 years the conservative end of our total return range assumes spg grows slower than expected potentially due to ongoing store closings that persist for many years source f a s t graphs factset research the ben graham fair value formula built into f a s t

that even with very conservative growth and valuation assumptions simon is capable of 11 cagr total returns compared to what asset managers expect from the broader market over the next seven to 15

potentially triggering a mild recession in late 2020 or 2021 what if none of these four super swans are your cup of tea that s where the rest of this article comes in a step by step walk through of how to screen quality companies for good to great valuations morningstar is a good but not perfect place to start looking for good ideas morningstar is typically though not always a good starting location for blue chip income investing ideas that s because they are 100 focused on long term fundamentals rather than 12 month price targets like most sell side analysts the ones that issue buy sell hold recommendations most of their fair value estimates are reasonable though not always more on this in a moment so here are all my blue chip watch list stocks that morningstar estimates are at least 20 undervalued source morningstar data as of november 22nd even with the market near all time highs you can see that at least according to morningstar there are plenty of quality names available at bargain prices dividend kings disagrees with some of these valuations imperial brands otcqx imbby is just 36 undervalued for example but for the most part these are quality companies trading at attractive valuations but you can t just look at any one analyst s fair value estimate and know if it s a good buy that s because every company has its own risk profile and differing business models mean that a 20 discount to fair value of a highly cyclical company like commodity producers isn t the same for one with very stable and recession resistant cash flow like a consumer staples company this is where looking at morningstar s star ratings is a good next step these ratings which correspond to a reasonable buy good buy and very strong buy recommendations factor in a company s risk profile industry trends management quality and morningstar s definition of moatiness which i sometimes disagree with but are for the most part on the money when it comes to corporations morningstar s moat definition is based on their belief that a company can maintain returns on invested capital above its weighted cost of capital using their assumptions plugged into the capm model for 20 years or longer wide moat and 10 years or more narrow moat i look for competitive advantages that allow returns on invested capital above the industry norm and above the cash cost of capital which matters more to the ability to grow dividends over time here are my watch list companies that morningstar considers 4 or 5 star buys and strong buys source morningstar data as of november 22nd q quantitative non analyst model estimate you ll note that there are a lot more 4 and 5 star stocks than ones trading 20 or below morningstar s estimated fair value that s because morningstar is adjusting for quality safety and overall cash flow stability via their uncertainty ratings this is why altria mo a 9 11 quality dividend king with very stable and recession resistant cash flow gets a four star rating from morningstar despite the analyst estimating it s just 13 undervalued and having poor management an assessment i disagree with dividend kings considers altria is a strong buy because it s 23 undervalued right now and likely to achieve 5 to 8 long term growth quality score out of 11 example good buy discount to fair value strong buy discount very strong buy discount 7 average quality at t t ibm 20 30 40 8 above average quality walgreens wba cvs cvs 15 25 35 9 blue chip quality altria abbvie abbv 10 20 30 10 swan sleep well at night quality pepsi pep dominion energy d 5 15 25 11 super swan as close to a perfect dividend stock as exists on wall street 3m johnson johnson jnj caterpillar cat msft lowe s low 0 10 20 click to enlarge to me a super swan dividend king like 3m nyse mmm is more attractive 20 undervalued than a lower quality company like ibm nyse ibm that s 35 undervalued but at the right price even an average quality company that has a safe dividend that s likely to grow at all is a potentially attractive investment at least for some people s needs however while a 4 or 5 star morningstar stock is usually a good long term investment it s important to remember that some of its recommendations can be far off the mark dividend kings uses a 100 pure f a s t graphs powered historical valuation method that only looks at historical and objective data and sometimes disagrees with morningstar typically these disagreements are minor sometimes they are not for example sources morningstar dividend kings valuation total return potential lists morningstar usually has similar estimates as us for most sectors but for popular momentum stocks like many tech names they often appear to try to justify rich valuations for example here are the p e multiples they use to determine fair value for super swans nike microsoft and unitedhealth nike 36 pe morningstar fair value historical pe range 22 to 26 microsoft 29 p e morningstar fair value historical pe range 16 to 20 unitedhealth 21 p e morningstar fair value historical pe range 14 to 18 how can you tell whether morningstar s fair value estimates are reasonable or just plain crazy by looking at objective metrics like p e ratios price to earnings vs historical norm while no single valuation method is perfect which is why dk uses 10 of them a good rule of thumb from chuck carnevale the sa king of value investing and founder of f a s t graphs is to try not to pay more than 15 times forward earnings for a company that s the same rule of thumb that ben graham the father of value investing considered a reasonable multiple to pay for a quality company this is because p e ratios are the most commonly used valuation metric on wall street and 15 0 p e being a reasonable price for quality companies is based on mr carnevale s 50 years of experience in asset management valuing companies he bases that on an earnings yield of 6 7 inverse of a 15 p e being roughly equal to the 200 year return of the stock market chuck also considers 15 times cash flow to be prudent for most companies as do all the founding dividend kings here are dozens of blue chip companies with very low forward p es and their five year average p es note that some industries are naturally prone to lower multiples such as financials due to more cyclical earnings which is why you want to compare their current p es to their historical norms morningstar offers 5 year average p es but 10 years is better for factoring in industry sector downturns source morningstar data as of november 22nd don t forget that p e ratios for mlps reits and yieldcos are not a good indication of value since high depreciation results in lower eps price cash flow is a better approach with such pass through stocks historical p e and a 15 0 rule of thumb are not perfect 5 year average p es can give a false reading if something extreme happened like a bubble or industry crash causing the energy p e ratio averages to become absurd this brings me to another important metric to check price to cash flow which replaces the p e ratio for reits yieldcos mlps midstreams and many lps price to cash flow vs historical norm while earnings are usually what wall street obsesses over it s actually cash flow that companies run on and use to pay a dividend repurchase shares and pay down debt thus the price to cash flow ratio can be considered a similar metric to the p e ratio but a more accurate representation of a company s value chuck carnevale also considers a 15 0 or smaller price to cash flow ratio to be a good rule of thumb for buying quality companies at a fair price buying a quality company at a modest to great cash flow multiple is a very high probability long term strategy again comparing a company s price to cash flow against its historical norm can tell you whether it s actually undervalued dividend kings uses 10 year average cash flows and morningstar only offers 5 year averages for cyclical companies sometimes that can cause skewed results which is why we use longer time periods and as many of our 10 valuation metrics are industry appropriate here are the companies on my watch list with the lowest price to cash flows source morningstar data as of november 22nd again historical price to cash flow estimates are not perfect terraform power terp a level 8 11 quality yieldco was run into the ground and nearly bankrupted by its former sponsor sunedison which did go bankrupt brookfield asset management bam rescued it and turned it into a great high yield dividend growth stock which justifies a much higher valuation similarly delta air lines dal trades at 4 4 times operating cash flow right now that s low but due to the cyclical nature of its industry the market has historically valued it at just 5 4 times cash flow source f a s t graphs factset research is delta undervalued yes it s worth 70 in 2019 so about 21 undervalued right now but the point is that you can t assume that the rule of thumb 15 times cash flow will be appropriate for all companies if you simply use the 15 rule of thumb on dal s 2019 expected operating cash flow per share you might think the company is worth 191 and that it might be 71 undervalued source f a s t graphs factset research worse still you might decide to back up the truck on delta assuming that a return to a 15 price to cash flow that the company has never actually traded at might mean 37 return potential delta actually has 8 to 13 long term growth potential and applying its 9 to 10 historical p e can deliver 9 to 18 cagr total returns over time that s still a great return and delta is a good buy on the dividend kings master list but when making decisions about where to invest your limited capital you need to have to know what a company is both truly worth or at least a reasonable estimate and what kind of total returns are realistically possible p e growth ratio growth at a reasonable price and putting it all together according to chuck carnevale and ben graham buffett s mentor and the father of value investing a 15 p e is prudent for most companies even slow growing ones but if a company is able to grow especially fast over 15 over time it deserves a higher multiple that s because the compounding power of time means a company that grows at a faster rate can generate many times greater wealth and income for you how much your money will grow based on company growth rate and time period long term growth rate 10 years 20 years 30 years 40 years 50 years 5 1 6 2 7 4 3 7 0 11 5 10 2 6 6 7 17 5 45 3 117 4 15 4 0 16 4 66 2 267 9

annually for 50 years which would mean earnings and cash flow growing nearly 1 billion fold it would have to literally take over the world most investors depending on their needs and ideal asset allocation can likely achieve 5 10 returns over time warren buffett is one of the greatest investors in history with about 21 cagr returns over 54 years since 2000 the s p 500 s earnings growth has been about 6 5 cagr which is why a company that can realistically grow much faster may be worth a higher than normal p e or price to cash flow this is where the p e growth or peg ratio comes in while this method is limited by what growth assumptions you use it s a quick and dirty way to screen for potentially attractive dividend growth investments when used in conjunction with other methods the s p 500 s peg ratio is currently 2 7 to 3 0 depending on the growth estimates you use a peg of 1 0 or less is generally excellent here are my watch list stocks with pegs of close to one as estimated by morningstar s forward growth forecast some of those growth estimates are likely to be proven wrong source morningstar data as of november 22nd peg is a good way to strive for growth at a reasonable price or garp however the obvious flaw is that it s based on forward projections that can be wrong all valuation metrics have their limitations which is why you shouldn t rely on just one for example fedex fdx is a great company trading at a nice discount which is why dividend kings deep value portfolio bought it but its peg is not 0 4 which implies about 30 long term growth 6 to 14 is realistic depending on if we get a recession here are the peg ratios of some of these companies using factset data and consensus growth estimates fedex 9 2 forward pe 13 long term growth 0 71 dal 9 0 forward pe 9 9 long term growth 0 91 pioneer natural resources pxd 4 9 forward p ebitda divided by 21 long term growth 0 23 cat 11 5 forward pe 12 0 long term growth 0 96 marathon petroleum mpc 3 9 forward p ebitda over 12 0 long term growth 0 33 broadcom avgo 13 2 forward pe 13 9 long term growth 0 95 a peg of close to one is excellent especially compared to the 3 peg of the broader market but the point is that screening a company via all of these approaches can minimize the chances of overpaying for a quality name make sure to check that earnings and cash flow are growing so you don t buy a value trap by mistake for example simon property passes all these value screens except peg dividend kings historical discount to fair value 29 very strong buy morningstar s estimated discount to fair value 22 4 stars 2019 p ffo 11 6 vs 15 to 18 historical peg 2 7 based on p ffo and factset 4 3 long term consensus growth notice how for simon you shouldn t get hung up on peg that s because it s an inappropriate metric for the sector source hoya capital real estate reits are owned for their very stable cash flow and thus trade at a very high peg the sector s peg is currently 20 4 p ffo over 4 7 growth so 4 3 is that high actually the reit sector p e has historically been about 4 3 because reits are experiencing a growth boom courtesy of high share prices and low cost of capital their 20 4 p ffo multiple is appropriate at least for as long as reits can maintain such above average growth simon s 2 7 peg is 37 below the sector average its expected growth rate is equal or slightly above the reit historical norm this disconnect between fundamentals and sector peers is how you need to consider peg when looking at reits basically first you need to know what companies are worth owning dividend king s motto is quality first valuation second and proper risk management always that s where a good watchlist is useful next you need to know what a company s worth today that involves looking at several fundamental valuation metrics such as dividends earnings and cash flow when you find a company that is both above average quality and trading at a below average valuation then you have truly found a powerful tool for achieving your long term financial goals quality stocks at 52 week lows are great screening candidates source google sheets data as of november 22nd bolded companies are within 5 of 52 week lows note that like any valuation screening tool 52 week lows are not sufficient but a place to begin your research i maintain a master list that takes every company i track for dividend kings and applies an 11 point quality score based on dividend safety the business model and management quality 7 average quality seek 20 discount to fair value and limit to 2 5 of invested capital or less 8 above average quality company seek 15 discount to fair value or better limit to 5 10 of invested capital 9 blue chip company limit to 5 10 of invested capital and seek 10 discount to fair value 10 swan stock buy with confidence at 5 or greater discount to fair value or better limit to 5 10 of invested capital 11 super swan as close to an ideal dividend stock as you can find on wall street fair value or better limit to 5 10 of your invested capital a score of 7 is average quality which means a 2 or smaller probability of a dividend cut during a recession based on how much s p 500 dividends have been cut in past economic downturns 2 was the highest average cut during the 1990 recession all other recessions were less source moon capital management nber multipl com i ve programmed that watch list to track prices and use the 52 week low as a means of knowing when a blue chip or swan stock is within 5 of its 52 week low and potentially a buffett style fat pitch investment this means a quality company is trading near its 52 week or often multi year low undervalued per other valuation methods offers a high probability of achieving significant multiple expansion within 5 10 years and thus delivering double digit long term total returns over this time period another method you can use is to target blue chips trading in protracted bear markets such as sharp discounts to their 5 year highs buying a company at multi year lows is another way to reduce the risk of overpaying and boost long term total return potential source morningstar data as of october november 22nd in the above table i ve set it up to show all the methods we ve discussed today you can thus see that most of the above companies are potentially fantastic long term buys based on many important valuation metrics including morningstar s qualitative ratings of management quality moat and margin of safety this is what i mean by fat pitch investing buying them when they are at their least popular be greedy when others are fearful it doesn t mean buying some speculative small company with an untested business model in hopes it becomes the next amazon nasdaq amzn the goal is to buy quality blue chips whose fundamentals are firmly intact and whose valuations are so ridiculously low that modest long term growth can deliver 15 25 cagr total returns as the market realizes its mistake mind you it can take a long time for coiled springs like these deep value blue chips to pop sometimes 5 10 years but as long as their business models remain intact and they keep growing cash flow and dividends they eventually will which is why seven of the nine best investors in history have been value investors bottom line no matter what happens next with trade talks the world isn t ending and there are great companies smart investors can safely buy i can t predict with certainty what will happen with trade talks or the stock market over the long term but here s my educated guess phase one talks drag on into 2020 but december 15th tariffs don t go up based on reuters report that a deal is more likely than not the market starved of earnings news and with the fed sitting pat on rate policy trades flat in a relatively tight range could i be wrong absolutely but the way to exponentially compound income and wealth over time and thus achieve your long term financial goals isn t to obsess over the short term but focus on the long term the us china trade conflict will not last forever right now 12 month recession risk is about 29 backed up by 19 leading indicators that are still 22 8 above their historical baseline slower growth in 2020 is not negative growth and any pullback or correction is not likely the start of the next great mega crash putting new money to work over time in quality companies at reasonable to attractive valuations is how you convert active income you have to work for into passive income that can support a prosperous retirement simon property

imbert imf would have ended free education healthcare in this file photo finance minister colm imbert right speaks with works and transport minister rohan sinanan during the caf development bank of latin america seminar at the trinidad hilton photo by sureash cholai finance minister colm imbert said if tt had gone to the international monetary fund imf it would have meant the end of free education and free healthcare he was speaking at the caf development bank of latin america seminar on monday at the hilton trinidad port of spain he said if tt had sought assistance from the lender of last resort government would have been forced to cut expenditure to the point that there would have been mass retrenchment in the public sector the cost of electricity and water would have increased significantly free education and free healthcare would have disappeared the social safety net would have been damaged and the currency would have been devalued he recalled in the previous energy price collapse of the 1980s the tt government chose to engage with the imf and standby arrangements which totalled us 184 million at the time they must have felt that they had no choice however the drastic decline in the price of oil coupled with an international environment crippled by stagflation slow economic growth and relatively high unemployment took its toll on our small island state the one size fits all austerity plan proposed by the imf at the time and implemented by the then government led to the collapse and the downsizing of numerous companies with industries like automotive construction retail and manufacturing industries suffering tremendously he said the economic contraction was swift and severe and saw tt s gdp decline by 40 per cent in just four years significant job losses a high rate of defaults on loans and mortgages and double digit unemployment imbert said in september 2015 when the present government assumed office oil prices were again dropping like a stone gas production was on the decline and gas prices were depressed sending our economy into turmoil he recalled several missions from the imf did their own in depth review of the economy and an imf technical team came at the government s request just after the 2015 election imbert said many of the proposals had a common theme and included implementing a property tax system extending the tax base increasing tax collection sin taxes on alcohol and tobacco personal income tax and corporation tax eliminating fuel subsidies eliminating or reducing other subsidies or transfers introducing wage and hiring restraint mechanisms reducing the size of the public sector and reducing government expenditure to match income to achieve a budget surplus does any of this sound familiar indeed 25 years after we got ourselves out of an imf programme we were advised to embrace the same old sterile provisions of 1990 focused on contraction without due consideration of the short and long term adverse effects on our citizens he said returning to the imf was not a road the government wished to travel we had had enough of that he said however returning to the imf was not a road government wished to travel we had had enough of that he said the lesson for other energy dependent countries faced with similar challenges included stay away form the imf at all costs imbert said through government s efforts tt was on the threshold of sustainable growth for the future and the prospect of a balanced budget he reported that moving forward government will focus on include expanding exports increasing forex earnings suppressing crime reversing non progressive attitudes values and behaviours such as low productivity and poor work ethos constitutional and institutional reform addressing the impact of shale gas on the tt market transforming the economic growth model into one that is environmentally friendly and addressing climate change through reducing greenhouses gasses he said it was a great pleasure to be a full member of caf and he appreciated the approach of caf to financing infrastructure and fiscal consolidation in tt it has been a breath of fresh air when compared to other development banks

this isn t a general election it s a general strike building up news line editor jonty leff told sunday s powerful over 100 strong news line anniversary rally at the indian ymca centre in fitzroy square central london on sunday afternoon people are saying shut parliament down well let s build the wrp up across the country let s overthrow the capitalist system he urged the audience a revolution in britain will be a decisive step in the world socialist revolution chairing the rally and opening it workers revolutionary party wrp central committee member frank sweeney said today we celebrate 50 years of production of the daily news line which is a great achievement the news line is the daily paper of the workers revolutionary party british section of the international committee of the fourth international world party of socialist revolution throughout its history it has come under strong attack from the bourgeoisie but we have always fought and beaten them on the basis of our fight for socialist policies in britain and a strong internationalist position today 11 years after the financial crisis of 2008 the whole of capitalist system is teetering on the brink of collapse around the world millions can t live and can t eat and it s the same in britain even amongst those in work also today we are marking the 79th anniversary of the assassination of comrade leon trotsky trotskyism is at the heart of our paper and the fight for the unity of marxist theory and practice as the essence of building the revolutionary leadership for the working class to overthrow the capitalist system and bring in a socialist society never before has there been a crisis like today now like never before is the time to build our party to lead the successful socialist revolution the first speaker was wrp central committee member dave wiltshire who said revolution is breaking out all over the world in france the yellow vests have been rising up for over one year now while there are also mass revolutionary movements across latin america in britain where there was a huge vote amongst postal workers for strike action there is a national debt of 1 8 trillion and a huge crisis in the nhs due to austerity cuts the working class delivered an almighty kick in the teeth to the ruling class in the referendum with every union except the rail unions and the bakers union which are to be congratulated instructing their members to vote remain the labour party wrote to all its members saying you must vote remain but the working class defied them the labour manifesto which was launched last thursday presented some attractive policies including nationalisation but it doesn t even mention socialism and how are they going to finance it mcdonnell was clear borrow 400 billion he came out and said we can borrow this because of low interest rates this is reformist lunacy there is a lot of pressure for interest rates to go up and are the bankers going to invest this money in a corbyn government allende in chile was crushed by the bankers and corbyn had better watch it or he might be facing his own allende moment even minimal socialist measures like are contained in labour s manifesto can only be brought in by socialist revolution we say that workers must expropriate the bankers and take over the banks bringing in a workers revolutionary government which will actually take the necessary action the real urgent task here is to build the party dr bob gill gp of great nhs heist said i have seen the rise in preventable harm and deaths in my patients because of the cuts while the passivity of the ccgs clinical commissioning groups etc is complicity it s taken 30 years to get where we are today in the onslaught on the nhs tony blair and gordon brown carried on the thatcher plan which was to rip out the core of hospital leaders and replace them with a huge bloated bureaucracy which removed power from the people responsible for delivering care once you have a bloated bureaucracy you can introduce market reforms and normalise the completely bogus buying and selling of healthcare the cost of the running of the market in the health service is estimated at 10 of the nhs budget in this country while in america it s an estimated 35 of their health budget the imf international monetary fund and world bank have been going around the world seizing assets in this country we had pfi private finance initiative which every new government blames the last one for pfi has saddled the nhs with un repayable debt under pfi the nhs has borrowed 11 billion and will have to pay back over 80 billion at the end of it you don t even own the asset it s all about grabbing various assets to you and me the nhs is doctors and nurses looking after patients but to them it s about acquiring assets land patient data budgets which are 120 billion a year the final trick they are pulling off is doctors being hoodwinked into signing a deal to accept all of this what we will have is a dumbed down service and in the future when you seek an appointment with your gp you will be met by a receptionist who will decide who you see it has been estimated that 120 000 people have died in excess of expectation in this country for three years in a row now infant mortality has gone up the first time this has been observed outside of wartime we have to stop this nightmarish trajectory joe brack from the julian assange defence committee said first i want to say thank you to the news line which has been incredibly supportive of julian s case many years ago wikileaks revealed what our government was doing in iraq and around the world unfortunately the uk justice system has said julian is not a journalist but a thief and he is facing a living death sentence of 175 years in belmarsh prison where he is in isolation 23 hours a day with no access to documents or a computer his father who visits him regularly says his physical and mental health is deteriorating each visit the status now is that we are very worried that julian will not make the february hearing next year on 13th and 19th december there are court hearings in westminster and anyone who can make it will be welcome we are demanding that uk laws apply and not us laws what they are doing is illegal and we are demanding that these ridiculous american extradition charges can be thrown back julian assange represents freedom of speech in this country and the world news line is one of the few newspapers that speaks out for this i will only vote for jeremy corbyn and diane abbott if they come out and tell us that they will give julian assange real support i hope we can free julian assange before christmas and not have to wait until february hassan zulkifal wrp general election candidate for ealing southall constituency said last monday we confronted tory health secretary matt hancock who came down to the front of ealing hospital to be filmed saying what a great success he s had by the fact that the a e is still there but it s not his success the tories closed our vital maternity and paediatrics departments and we ve been fighting for seven years against their nhs cuts plans under which these vital units were closed i asked him to sign our petition to reopen maternity and paediatrics but he said he doesn t sign petitions and he actually ran away from us while his minders tried to stop us from filming him as he ran i spoke to him and according to matt hancock all the tory nhs decisions are clinically led but these are just buzzwords they pay consultants millions of pounds to justify their cuts closures and privatisation programme on our friday morning pickets of ealing hospital we get great support from the public and health workers especially nurses and they all sign our petition but not hancock zulkifal continued we re fighting to build a youth movement the younger generation know the politicians are liars we re on zero hours contracts and the youth have been let down again and again the only way forward is to take over the means of production we re all going to get old but the care workers are paid absolute peanuts there s no difference between the war against the working class in this country and the wars around the world mayra crean ecuadorian citizens assembly said on 3rd october people came onto the streets to protest against the government s austerity policies our previous government of rafael corea nationalised oil and gas carried out a number of socialist policies and kicked the imf out but the new government returned julian assange to the british government out of london s ecuadorian embassy earlier this year cut health and education and brought in massive unemployment people have got very angry the new president blamed corea and venezuelan president maduro for the crisis in ecuador and the propaganda was massive the government called for the police to come out which has left 29 people dead thousands injured and many illegally incarcerated the minister of defence said the police are too weak and didn t use enough force there is massive repression of people who used to work with the corea government all of this is happening in ecuador and it s also happening in bolivia and chile too all over latin america all this comes from the imf whose only aim is to steal our resources news line editor and wrp general election candidate for hackney south jonty leff said news line has played a pivotal role in the election to organise mobilise and recruit new members it s three years since the referendum and the vote to leave the eu but parliament has been doing everything it can to prevent brexit we ve got to break with the eu now this is a revolutionary struggle a world movement of people rising up against this capitalist system to abolish the mountains of debt we are proud of the role that our paper plays and firstly from news line we send special revolutionary greetings to the palestinian people we demand the trade unions act after trump gave full support to the illegal israeli settlements last week the trade unions must organise a boycott of israel the eu has imposed austerity everywhere 110 yellow vests came over to support the julian assange campaign earlier in the autumn in france workers are demanding frexit they want out of the eu while in greece which has sold off hospitals schools everything to pay for the loans from the troika they want grexit in italy there is 30 youth unemployment in spain it s 37 we are for the unity of the european working class through the creation of a united socialist states of europe that s the only way forward the italian banks are about to crash when that happens it will spread like wildfire the brexit vote was revolutionary and our wrp candidates are getting huge support for their policies of a general strike to bring down the government quit the eu now with no compensation and nationalise the banks and all major industries build a revolutionary leadership people are furious with labour s position we demand that labour deselects those right wing mps who are working might and main against brexit step up our campaign contained within this election is the huge divide in parliament and within that is the widening class divide lots of elderly people are being admitted to hospital with malnutrition the gig economy is zero hours zero pay and zero future the high court judgement last week ruling the royal mail strike illegal shows the huge fear of the working class by the capitalist state and the ruling class this isn t a general election this is a general strike building up people are saying shut parliament down let s build the wrp up across the country let s overthrow the capitalist system a revolution in britain will be a decisive step in the world socialist revolution the rally concluded with an enthusiastic rendition of the international

east hartford connecticut federal reserve chairman jerome powell normally spends his days in the marble halls of washington meeting with senators and fed economists on monday he learned about the job market from an 18 year old named jasmine get fox business on the go by clicking here a recent high school graduate jasmine ayala explained to powell how she has just landed a good job as a laser operator at aircraft engine manufacturer pratt whitney after graduation she received seven weeks of training backed by a grant from a local nonprofit called east hartford connects it was an amazing opportunity ayala said her exchange with the chairman of the world s most powerful central bank came during a visit powell paid monday to a hardscrabble neighborhood of east hartford the trip included a neighborhood tour and a meeting with residents to get an up front look at their challenges monday s events are part of an ongoing outreach by the powell fed to representatives of labor unions educators and community development groups many participants have told fed officials that despite entrenched poverty in some areas of the country more disadvantaged americans are finally finding jobs and making economic progress fed chair powell hints at future of interest rates says action possible one major reason for that is the existence of training programs like the one that helped ayala since becoming chairman nearly two years ago powell has sent a message seldom heard from his predecessors that the fed should consider the struggles of the lowest income americans in setting its interest rate policies low interest rates generally help sustain a solid job market which in turn can encourage job training efforts as unemployment has reached a nearly a 50 year low of 3 6 more employers are taking more chances on young people without college degrees and are training them we try to create a strong labor market but for some it s not enough powell said after residents told of vital help they have received from east hartford connects including child support assistance that allowed them to re enter the job market they need to be given a chance trump s fed pick judy shelton questions need for independent central bank the notion that the fed should try to sustain the expansion to help the most disadvantaged people might seem self evident but throughout its history the fed whose mandate is to stabilize prices and maximize employment has rarely expressed the need to suit its policies to benefit the least fortunate with unemployment low most of powell s predecessors would have focused on the threat of high inflation and the possibility of raising rates to forestall it the prevailing belief has been that addressing economic inequality or poverty is the purview of congress not the fed what i sense is different is that he sees those benefits to workers as so important that he is less willing to lose those benefits to quell phantom inflation said tim duy an economist at the university of oregon fed minutes reveal officials unlikely to cut rates again powell still says the fed s main focus is the health of the job market and the stability of prices but as he nears the end of his second year as chairman he has increasingly opened the door to the idea that the fed can also lift up those who still struggle years after an economic expansion has boosted the fortunes of most americans one driver of that change has been the outreach effort the fed launched a year ago as part of a review of its financial tools and strategy in august at an annual gathering of central bankers in jackson hole wyoming powell began his speech by observing how the u s economic expansion the longest on record was finally benefiting working people through higher pay and more plentiful job opportunities his speech took some economists by surprise it is almost inconceivable that powell s predecessors would have begun an important talk on monetary policy this way dean baker an economist at the progressive center for economic and policy research later wrote in a column that called powell a labor day hero powell has explicitly made the plight of the poor and working class part of the fed s agenda baker wrote janet yellen powell s immediate predecessor had begun to raise these issues during her tenure at the 2016 jackson hole conference some of yellen s deputies met with members of fed up an organization that advocates for low rates to support economic growth and hiring but stephanie aaronson director of economic studies at the brookings institution and a former fed economist said powell has linked fed policy more explicitly to issues like inequality ben bernanke who preceded yellen as fed chair spoke about economic inequality but his stated remedies were in areas outside the fed s reach like education and job training and in the past when fed officials would meet with community groups they tended to discuss issues that only indirectly help the economically disadvantaged fairness in bank lending for example the fed s current outreach is actually about monetary policy and that does make it really different from the usual types of interactions that the fed has with community groups aaronson said aaronson co authored research this spring that found that a persistently low unemployment rate can significantly narrow employment gaps between whites and african americans and latinos her research also found that the narrowing of that gap accelerated as unemployment fell further in east hartford s school system nearly half the students are latino chela gage director of talent acquisition at pratt whitney which is based in east hartford said the persistence of low unemployment has led the company to think more creatively about hiring we are stretching our arms to see where the talent lies she said ayala was working part time while still in high school applying make up at weddings and other events for 10 10 an hour that income helped her family and she wasn t sure she could have given it up for training without the stipend she received her new job at pratt whitney pays 29 an hour click here to read more on fox business she s also attending school at night to earn her bachelor s degree things don t happen unless you work hard she said j w mason an assistant professor at john jay college said that fed officials haven t often acknowledged that their policies have varying consequences for different socioeconomic groups many economists have long argued for example that when the fed raises rates to try to stop prices from accelerating it risks hindering the kind of robust job market that disproportionately helps disadvantaged workers it s not just about the whole economy mason said it s about who s benefiting it s always been true but people didn t want to acknowledge it

situation in china and how the trade war is affecting u s farmers back in august when de last reported the company s earnings missed street expectations and its ceo said a high degree of uncertainty continues to overshadow the agricultural sector basically the takeaway was that farmers were delaying equipment purchases due to that uncertainty since then we haven t had any solid movement on the trade situation so one question is whether farmers are still saving their money for better times if you look at the price charts for corn and soybean futures recently it doesn t look like there s much

year is it possible the 10 year yield could make another run at 2 before the end of the year that s a mark it couldn t quite reach earlier this month and hasn t touched in nearly four months now it s treading water below 1 8 another push for 2 might not be out of the question if a trade deal looks more likely or if there s solid manufacturing and jobs data early next month still as one analyst said on the td ameritrade network recently it s hard to see the 10 year yield climbing back above 2 25 anytime soon there s just too much quantitative easing pressing down yields in europe and japan and that makes the u s bond market seem pretty attractive to many investors facing negative yields elsewhere when those investors jump into the u s bond market for yield that sends bond prices here higher and yields get pushed downward targeting two here s another 2 question to contemplate can inflation hit the fed s 2 year over year target this wednesday when personal consumption expenditure pce prices come out the headline number has been trending just shy of 2 the fed s target inflation level for months coming in at 1 7 year over year in september down from 1 8 in august month over month however was flat in september going into october s report analysts look for just 0 1 month over month growth which means we d have another month of annual inflation under the fed s target the wild card if there is one is that the producer price index ppi rose a solid 0 4 in october some of that was driven by what might be short term issues like energy costs but if producer prices do keep rising the concern is it could eventually translate into higher product costs for consumers tepid gdp seen likely here and across pacific the other big data report tomorrow morning is quarterly gross domestic product gdp this is the government s second crack at estimating q3 growth with the last one coming in at a tepid 1 9 the consensus estimate going into tomorrow is for no change from that according to briefing com if so the economy would remain stuck at the lowest quarterly gdp growth since q3 2016 it s possible the trade war is playing a part along with slow overseas economic growth it probably doesn t help the u s economy that china one of its biggest trading partners is experiencing its slowest growth since 1992 at 6 in the most recent quarter a think tank in beijing said earlier this month that gdp growth in china could fall below 6 in 2020 and that s in line with what the international monetary fund imf is thinking meanwhile economists here in the u s look for q4 u s

close to the low end of the recent range the dollar index on the other hand quietly creeps higher it finished above 98 3 on monday the recent high is slightly above 99 so that could be a level to watch deere season starts wednesday before turkey there s deere de the huge agricultural company is due out with earnings tomorrow morning and investors might want to listen closely to the call for any new observations from its executives about the situation in china and how the trade war is affecting u s farmers back in august when de last reported the company s earnings missed street expectations and its ceo said a high degree of uncertainty continues to overshadow the agricultural sector basically the takeaway was that farmers were delaying equipment purchases due to that uncertainty since then we haven t had any solid movement on the trade situation so one question is whether farmers are still saving their money for better times if you look at the price charts for corn and soybean futures recently it doesn t look like there s much reason for them to be cheering and that might mean more tough sledding for de on the other hand if there s progress on a new north american trade agreement that could potentially help industrial companies like de some analysts say that s not something that would have factored into de s recent quarter naturally data sources ftse russell s p dow jones indices chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade two still a tangle for 10 year is it possible the 10 year yield could make another run at 2 before the end of the year that s a mark it couldn t quite reach earlier this month and hasn t touched in nearly four months now it s treading water below 1 8 another push for 2 might not be out of the question if a trade deal looks more likely or if there s solid manufacturing and jobs data early next month still as one analyst said on the td ameritrade network recently it s hard to see the 10 year yield climbing back above 2 25 anytime soon there s just too much quantitative easing pressing down yields in europe and japan and that makes the u s bond market seem pretty attractive to many investors facing negative yields elsewhere when those investors jump into the u s bond market for yield that sends bond prices here higher and yields get pushed downward targeting two here s another 2 question to contemplate can inflation hit the fed s 2 year over year target this wednesday when personal consumption expenditure pce prices come out the headline number has been trending just shy of 2 the fed s target inflation level for months coming in at 1 7 year over year in september down from 1 8 in august month over month however was flat in september going into october s report analysts look for just 0 1 month over month growth which means we d have another month of annual inflation under the fed s target the wild card if there is one is that the producer price index ppi rose a solid 0 4 in october some of that was driven by what might be short term issues like energy costs but if producer prices do keep rising the concern is it could eventually translate into higher product costs for consumers tepid gdp seen likely here and across pacific the other big data report tomorrow morning is quarterly gross domestic product gdp this is the government s second crack at estimating q3 growth with the last one coming in at a tepid 1 9 the consensus estimate going into tomorrow is for no change from that according to briefing com if so the economy would remain stuck at the lowest quarterly gdp growth since q3 2016 it s possible the trade war is playing a part along with slow overseas economic growth it probably doesn t help the u s economy that china one of its biggest trading partners is experiencing its slowest growth since 1992 at 6 in the most recent quarter a think tank in beijing said earlier this month that gdp growth in china could fall below 6 in 2020 and that s in line with what the international monetary fund imf is thinking meanwhile economists here in the u s look for q4 u s gdp to be just above flat with the atlanta fed s gdp now indicator at 0 4 td ameritrade

u s equity indexes were moderately higher on tuesday as traders await progress of a phase one trade deal between china and the u s and mull some generally optimistic remarks on the economy by federal reserve chairman jerome powell the dow jones industrial average gained 41 14 points to 28 107 61 while the s p 500 was up 5 32 points to 3 138 96 and the nasdaq composite index gained 17 11 points to 8 649 60 trade talks between china and the u s were conducted by phone on tuesday and officials reached consensus on properly resolving relevant issues and promised to discuss other points of the phase one deal china s ministry of commerce said in a statement the u s trade representative s office confirmed a meeting took place global times reported officials likely discussed such matters as tariff removal and agricultural purchases we take any positive pronouncements on a trade deal with healthy skepticism given how long this has dragged out rabobank strategists wrote tuesday it would seem that any major progress on the trade deal front will be hindered by the ongoing unrest in hong kong federal reserve board chair jerome powell took a somewhat upbeat view of the u s economy in comments made monday evening in rhode island to the greater providence chamber of commerce powell said with the jobless rate near a 50 year low of 3 6 there is plenty of room for wages to rise and for more people to join the workforce recent years data paint a hopeful picture of more people in their prime years in the workforce and wages rising for low and middle income workers powell said but this is just a start there is still plenty of room for building on these gains the fed can play a role in this effort powell said the three cuts in interest rates this year have prompted more homebuying which in turn has helped continue the economic expansion fortunately the outlook for further progress is good forecasters are generally predicting continued growth a strong job market and inflation near 2 he said but powell pointed out the negative effects of persistently low inflation around the world however we have seen that inflation running persistently below target can lead to an unhealthy dynamic in which inflation expectations drift down pulling actual inflation further down he said lower inflation can in turn pull interest rates to ever lower levels the experience of japan and now the euro area suggests that this dynamic is very difficult to reverse and once under way it can make it harder for a central bank to support its economy by further lowering interest rates that is why it is essential that we at the fed use our tools to make sure that we do not permit an unhealthy downward drift in inflation expectations and inflation for now powell added monetary policy is well positioned to support a strong labor market and return inflation decisively to our symmetric 2 objective if the outlook changes materially policy will change as well at this point in the long

that stocks remain at a record high seems counter intuitive after all with a seemingly endless trade war raging on portents of economic gloom flaring up worldwide and an impeachment inquiry ongoing one would think that confidence in the market particularly the s p 500 spy voo ivv and the dividend aristocrats nobl would be ebbing one would be wrong contrariwise many bulls are under the impression that the market will roar forever they too are wrong market confidence is not going to last forever image taken from the observer there is one course of action in this set of circumstances that i believe is not wrong but first let s look at the issues that should be adversely impacting market confidence and yet apparently are having next to no effect factors in play the trade war between the u s and china fxi which has been raging for over a year now is rooted in mutual suspicion on the u s side the suspicion that china is engaging in unfair trading and theft of intellectual property is not only idly rumored but openly stated by the president of the united states of america for china s part the suspicion is that the west in general and the u s in particular is actively trying to put the brakes on its surge as a world power the uncertainty introduced to the world economy by the trade war between the u s and china shows no signs of abating image taken from global meat news the resultant tariffs that each country has imposed on the other which affect billions of dollars worth of their respective goods are having an adverse impact on business and has mired the world economy in uncertainty it is further intensified by the populist politics which has also been contributing problems to other parts of the world that also exhibit signs of economic instability hong kong ewh the autonomous region which has seen widespread political unrest over the legitimacy of its autonomy is one such area as these two factors have led officials to declare that the city s economy is expected to shrink by 1 3 this would be the first annual decline that hong kong suffers since 2009 in the midst of the global great recession hong kong is not the only advanced economy facing issues in europe italy s debt burden remains the major concern of leaders and investors alike with â 1 5 trillion 1 7 trillion worth of debt on italy s ewi books and â 425 billion worth of italian debt private and sovereign on the books of europe s main banks a sell off due to populist politics could leave these banks and the european economy in general facing severe headaches european bank italian

figures generated from bloomberg italy is far from the only european country that faces economic challenges going forward the united kingdom fxe as a consequence of the self imposed stupidity that is brexit is also suffering from the toxic combination of populist politics and adverse financial circumstances the divisive political landscape the looming general election the prospect of being shut out of the eu market the possible secession of northern ireland and scotland the firms which have exited britain due to the uncertainty of the brexit process it is small wonder that investors look at the uk with a skeptical eye brexit is but one of a myriad of economic and political upheavals worldwide image taken from the washington post one could go on in this vein the spiraling crisis in venezuela the weak prospects for south africa the continuation of short term monetary fixes to the problem worldwide the all pervasive climate crisis all of these issues are either going to have an impact or are already impacting large economies which are based in manufacturing including the u s economy yet the u s economy udn usdu seems resistant nonetheless why the u s economy seems resistant the primary reason why the u s economy has held up better is because it is a consumer economy and according to the university of michigan consumer sentiment is up from 95 5 in october to 95 7 this suggests consumers are optimistic about both their own financial position and the economic future more substantially although there are signs of slower consumer spending the commerce department recently reported that such spending did increase albeit marginally by 0 2 for september in line with expectations furthermore the u s job market remains a strong one while hiring has slowed overall over the past year an estimated 140 000 jobs were added in september an increase from the 130 000 added in august consequently americans continue to buy consumer goods and this more modest growth path is expected to continue consumer growth is continuing though the pace is slowing image taken from the new york times furthermore the federal reserve has done its bit to encourage such growth to continue cutting interest rates these low interest rates of course serve to encourage borrowing and spending and further cuts are anticipated as per gregory daco oxford economics chief u s economist who opined with wage growth no longer accelerating and employment growth cooling growth in consumer spending is expected to moderate as we enter 2020 we believe the fed will be prompted to reassess and provide one additional rate cut in march 2020 of course for investors low interest rates serve to make stocks more attractive than bonds indeed what we have is what has been called the tina market there is no alternative if the other big economies outside of the u s are in worse shape and the other asset classes are less attractive then there is no alternative to u s stocks for investors seeking a decent return on their investments appearances are deceptive markets may be hitting records but stocks are not necessarily surging higher wall street s bullishness can turn bearish quite rapidly one should not be so arrogant as to assume american exceptionalism in the current environment the factors outlined above will eventually have an impact on the u s economy too in june the institute for supply management released a report showing that production is at its lowest level since october 2016 and pinpointed the tariffs imposed due to the u s china trade war as the reason for this decline midwestern farmers are also being adversely affected by the trade war with the number of farmers filing for bankruptcy double that of those who filed in 2008 during the great recession a broader view of the job market provides a more disquieting picture the bureau of labor statistics reported that between february 2017 shortly after donald trump took office and june 2019 the economy created an average of 194 000 jobs per month lower than the 221 000 jobs per month average that were created between september 2014 and january 2017 under president donald trump u s national debt has now rose to 22 trillion image taken from business insider worst of all is the national debt which has now ballooned to 22 trillion an amount that the junior senator for georgia david perdue has said should have sounded alarm bells as perdue told the washington post the single greatest threat to our national security is our national debt and it s time washington comes to grips with that reality ultimately the debt impacts our ability to fund priorities like providing our men and women in uniform with the resources they need to protect americans this debt crisis will only get worse and if we don t act now our country will lose the ability to do the right thing questions over america s ability to do the right thing in the midst of an impeachment inquiry and a thoroughly poisonous political climate are flying thick and fast but fewer voices among the public are raised regarding the economy despite the facts outlined above many are complacent in the face of such facts because the current bull market is the longest in history but the reason for its atypical length is its starting point the second worst recession in history the over confidence in the current market seems oblivious to this starting point but we may already be seeing the turn the major red flag in august the yields on 10 year treasury bonds ief dipped below the 2 year treasury bond yield dtus dtul this is the first time this has happened since 2007 what i wrote about this last month expresses my present view on the situation the longer your money is lent to a government the greater the return you expect owing to the higher risk of government default the yield curve inversion however results in the 10 year bond yielding less than 2 year bonds the consequence of this is that investors are offered lower returns for lending over a longer time frame than a shorter time frame would yield it suggests that lower economic growth is expected long term suggesting that a recession is coming now the yield curve inversion is not a cast iron guarantee that a recession will occur it may simply be an expression of investor nervousness bond prices have been affected by central banks over the past decade and this may be having an impact on market behavior too but i d lean more towards the likelihood that recession is coming when it comes is of course a question i cannot answer while i cannot say for certain when a recession is coming there is a general consensus that it will come to pass indeed the cfo global business outlook survey carried out by duke university reported that 70 of cfos anticipate a recession will hit by the end of 2020 what is to be done so what is to be done i address myself to one specific type of investor here the long term value investor that is someone who is interested in buying quality stocks at bargain prices day traders and similar types can feel free to drift off now to the long term value investors i have this to say at present you should do one thing store up as much cash as you possibly can liquidity is vital to take advantage of the coming economic downturn image taken from usa today at first glance it seems counter intuitive to devote yourself to storing up the one asset class that will deteriorate in value over time but having a large amount of liquidity will enable you to forfeit the option of having to sell your current assets for less than they are worth when the recession comes having a large cash surplus will position you to do the following once the market does hit the skids and it will it is not a case of if but when take advantage of the blue chip stocks that will be on offer at bargain basement prices companies such as microsoft msft and johnson johnson jnj are aaa rated behemoths that will weather the coming storm successfully but that will not stop their share prices going down along with the rest of the market the opportunity to make a huge investment at a bargain price in both of these companies and many others like them such as the constituents of the dividend aristocrats index or the overvalued choice constituents of the s p 500 such as alphabet goog googl amazon amzn or apple aapl will leave many such investors in a far better position over the long term the case of microsoft is particularly telling the only issue i have with the company is its valuation as i explained in detail in my article last month however peruse the comments section and you will find plenty of bulls who went out of their way to miss my point buy now or you will miss out is the essence of the reaction of most of the commenters there price is what you pay value is what you get in the event of a recession a very likely event and not just in my opinion buying a stock that i believe to be overvalued now and that i anticipate will fall in price in the near future simply makes no sense what is true of microsoft is true of many other excellent companies with sky high valuations such as automatic data processing adp mcdonald s mcd and walmart wmt if you think such stocks are expensive now as i do and believed that they would be cheaper to buy one year hence what would you do would you buy now for fear of missing out or would you wait accumulating as much dry powder as possible until the recession hits and take advantage of the cheaper entry point you will be offered at that time i doubt i have to spell out what i would do at this point but just in case i ll make it plain i ll take the second option and i believe i have made my case in this article for why i will do so conclusion in the present climate it would be naive indeed to believe that all will continue to be rosy going forward the u s china trade war the economic problems flaring up worldwide the underlying problems with the u s economy the bond yield curve inversion all signs point to a recession a conclusion that many experts have drawn despite this the bulls continue to roar to the disciplined value investor i advise prudence be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy right now greed still trumps fear wait until the financial panic that is on the horizon cuts loose review the s p 500 and the dividend aristocrats for those stocks that you would find beneficial as long term holdings at the right price build up your cash reserves in the meantime and position yourself to take advantage of the fear that is coming that is what i plan to do in any event
5 min 1403 words read download pdf central banks and financial regulators are starting to factor in climate change climate change is already a reality ever more ferocious cyclones and extended droughts lead to the destruction of infrastructure and the disruption of livelihoods and contribute to mass migration actions to combat rising temperatures inadequate though they may have been so far have the potential to drive dislocation in the business world as fossil fuel giants awaken to the need for renewable sources of energy and automakers accelerate investments in cleaner vehicles but measuring economic costs of climate change remains a work in progress we can assess the immediate costs of changing weather patterns and more frequent and intense natural disasters but most of the potential costs lie beyond the horizon of the typical economic analysis the economic impact of climate change will likely accelerate though not smoothly crucially for the coming generations the extent of the damage will depend on policy choices that we make today policymakers and investors increasingly recognize climate change s important implications for the financial sector climate change affects the financial system through two main channels see chart 1 the first involves physical risks arising from damage to property infrastructure and land the second transition risk results from changes in climate policy technology and consumer and market sentiment during the adjustment to a lower carbon economy exposures can vary significantly from country to country lower and middle income economies are typically more vulnerable to physical risks for financial institutions physical risks can materialize directly through their exposures to corporations households and countries that experience climate shocks or indirectly through the effects of climate change on the wider economy and feedback effects within the financial system exposures manifest themselves through increased default risk of loan portfolios or lower values of assets for example rising sea levels and a higher incidence of extreme weather events can cause losses for homeowners and diminish property values leading to greater risks in mortgage portfolios corporate credit portfolios are also at risk as highlighted by the bankruptcy of california s largest utility pacific gas and electric in what the wall street journal called the first climate change bankruptcy gold 2019 rapid climatic changes caused prolonged droughts in california that dramatically increased the risk of fires from pacific gas and electric s operations tighter financial conditions might follow if banks reduce lending in particular when climate shocks affect many institutions simultaneously for insurers and reinsurers physical risks are important on the asset side but risks also arise from the liability side as insurance policies generate claims with a higher frequency and severity than originally expected there is evidence that losses from natural disasters are already increasing as a result insurance is likely to become more expensive or even unavailable in at risk areas of the world climate change can make banks insurers and reinsurers less diversified because it can increase the likelihood or impact of events previously considered uncorrelated such as droughts and floods transition risks materialize on the asset side of financial institutions which could incur losses on exposure to firms with business models not built around the economics of low carbon emissions fossil fuel companies could find themselves saddled with reserves that are in the words of bank of england governor mark carney 2015 literally unburnable in a world moving toward a low carbon global economy these firms could see their earnings decline businesses disrupted and funding costs increase because of policy action technological change and consumer and investor demands for alignment with policies to tackle climate change coal producers for example already grapple with new or expected policies curbing carbon emissions and a number of large banks have pledged not to provide financing for new coal facilities the share prices of us coal mining companies reflect this carbon discount as well as higher financing costs and have been underperforming relative to those of companies holding clean energy assets risks can also materialize through the economy at large especially if the shift to a low carbon economy proves abrupt as a consequence of prior inaction poorly designed or difficult to coordinate globally with consequent disruptions to international trade financial stability concerns arise when asset prices adjust rapidly to reflect unexpected realizations of transition or physical risks there is some evidence that markets are partly pricing in climate change risks but asset prices may not fully reflect the extent of potential damage and policy action required to limit global warming to 2 c or less central banks and financial regulators increasingly acknowledge the financial stability implications of climate change for example the network of central banks and supervisors for greening the financial system ngfs an expanding group that currently comprises 42 members has embarked on the task of integrating climate related risks into supervision and financial stability monitoring given the large shifts in asset prices and catastrophic weather related losses that climate change may cause prudential policies should adapt to recognize systemic climate risk for example by requiring financial institutions to incorporate climate risk scenarios into their stress tests in the united kingdom prudential regulators have incorporated climate change scenarios into stress tests of insurance firms that cover both physical and transition risks efforts to incorporate climate related risks into regulatory frameworks face important challenges however capturing climate risk properly requires assessing it over long horizons and using new methodological approaches so that prudential frameworks adequately reflect actual risks it is crucial to ensure that the efforts to bring in climate risk strengthen rather than weaken prudential regulation policies such as allowing financial institutions to hold less capital against debt simply because the debt is labeled as green could easily backfire through increased leverage and financial instability if the underlying risks in that debt have not been adequately understood and measured climate change will affect monetary policy too by slowing productivity growth for example through damage to health and infrastructure and heightening uncertainty and inflation volatility this can justify the adaptation of monetary policy to the new challenges within the limits of central bank mandates central banks should revise the frameworks for their refinancing operations to incorporate climate risk analytics possibly applying larger haircuts to assets materially exposed to physical or transition risks central banks can also lead by example by integrating sustainability considerations into the investment decisions for the portfolios under their management i e their own funds pension funds and to the extent possible international reserves as recommended by the ngfs 2019 in its first comprehensive report financial sector contribution carbon pricing and other fiscal policies have a primary role in reducing emissions and mobilizing revenues see putting a price on pollution in this issue of f d but the financial sector has an important complementary role financial institutions and markets already provide financial protection through insurance and other risk sharing mechanisms such as catastrophe bonds to partly absorb the cost of disasters but the financial system can play an even more fundamental role by mobilizing the resources needed for investments in climate mitigation reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation building resilience to climate change in response to price signals such as carbon prices in other words if policymakers implement policies to price in externalities and provide incentives for the transition to a low carbon economy the financial system can help achieve these goals efficiently global investment requirements for addressing climate change are estimated in the trillions of us dollars with investments in infrastructure alone requiring about 6 trillion per year up to 2030 oecd 2017 most of these investments are likely to be intermediated through the financial system from this point of view climate change represents for the financial sector as much a source of opportunity as a source of risk the growth of sustainable finance the integration of environmental social and governance criteria into investment decisions across all asset classes shows the increasing importance that investors attribute to climate change among other nonfinancial considerations estimates of the global asset size of sustainable finance range from 3 trillion to 31 trillion while sustainable investing started in equities strong investor demand and policy support spurred issuance of green bonds growing the stock to an estimated 590 billion in august 2019 from 78 billion in 2015 banks are also beginning to adjust their lending policies by for example giving discounts on loans for sustainable projects sustainable finance can contribute to climate change mitigation by providing incentives for firms to adopt less carbon intensive technologies and specifically financing the development of new technologies channels through which investors can achieve this goal include engaging with company management advocating for low carbon strategies as investor activists and lending to firms that are leading in regard to sustainability all these actions send price signals directly and indirectly in the allocation of capital however measuring the impact that sustainable investments have on their environmental targets remains challenging there are concerns over unsubstantiated claims of assets green compliant nature known as greenwashing there is a risk that investors may become reluctant to invest at the scale necessary to counter or mitigate climate change especially if policy action to address climate change is lagging or insufficient the imf s role the analysis of risks and vulnerabilities and advising its members on macro financial policies are at the core of the imf s mandate the integration of climate change risks into these activities is critical given the magnitude and global nature of the risks climate change is posing to the world an area where the imf can especially contribute is understanding the macro financial transmission of climate risks one aspect of this is further improving stress tests such as those within the financial sector assessment program the imf s comprehensive and in depth analysis of member countries financial sectors stress testing is a key component of the program with these stress tests often capturing the physical risks related to disasters such as insurance losses and nonperforming loans associated with natural disasters assessments for the bahamas and jamaica are recently published examples with a scenario based stress test analyzing the macroeconomic impact of a severe hurricane in the former and a massive natural disaster in the latter more assessments of this kind are in progress or planned for other countries the imf is also conducting an analysis of financial system exposure to transition risk in an oil producing country the imf has recently joined the ngfs and is collaborating with its members to develop an analytical framework for assessing climate related risks closing data gaps is also crucial only with accurate and adequately standardized reporting of climate risks in financial statements can investors discern companies actual exposures to climate related financial risks there are promising efforts to support private sector disclosures of such risks but these disclosures are often voluntary and uneven across countries and asset classes comprehensive climate stress testing by central banks and supervisors would require much better data the imf supports public and private sector efforts to further spread the adoption of climate disclosures across markets and jurisdictions particularly by following the recommendations of the task force on climate related financial disclosures 2017 greater standardization would also improve the comparability of information in financial statements on climate risks the potential impact of climate change compels us to think through in an empirical fashion the economic costs of climate change each destructive hurricane and every unnaturally parched landscape will chip away at global output just as the road to a low carbon economy will escalate the cost of energy sources as externalities are no longer ignored and old assets are rendered worthless on the other hand carbon taxes and energy saving measures that reduce the emission of greenhouse gases will drive the creation of new technologies finance will have to play an important role in managing this transition for the benefit of future generations pierpaolo grippa is a senior economist in the imf s monetary and capital markets department jochen schmittmann is the imf s resident

by joseph otting 31st u s comptroller of the currency few would have predicted the strength of banks in the united states 11 years after treasury secretary hank paulson called together the chief executive officers of the nine largest to inject into them 125 billion in liquidity by purchasing preferred stock from that meeting on october 13 2008 us banks have returned from the brink to take over the world the strength of banks in the united states today reflects more than a decade of great work by banks boards and management as well as regulators and suggests a cultural shift toward comprehensive risk management how did that change occur and what can global regulators and bankers learn from the return of us banks responding to a crisis volumes have been written about the crisis its contagion and the role of the troubled asset relief program tarp in recovery some forget that the united states house of representatives voted against authorizing the tarp on september 29 2008 the markets greeted that decision with the largest single day point drop to date confidence was shaken congress responded by voting to authorize the tarp on october 3 ten days later the treasury launched the capital purchase program cpp and injected 125 billion into the nine largest domestic banks and allowed them to participate in the federal deposit insurance corporation s fdic s debt and transaction account guarantee program markets liked the news jumping 11 percent the next day confidence was on the mend the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 authorized 700 billion for the tarp but that full amount was never spent it was reduced to 475 billion by the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act in 2010 of that 475 billion the department of the treasury disbursed 442 billion 245 billion to 707 banks of all sizes 68 billion to bail out american international group aig 80 billion to the big three us automakers 20 billion to credit markets and 30 billion to refinance and modify troubled home mortgages since that time the treasury has been reimbursed 443 billion including 276 billion from banks 73 billion from aig 71 billion from auto companies and 24 billion from credit markets see figure 1 that is nearly a 13 percent return on the tarp funds invested in us banks as of september 10 2019 just 17 million of the original tarp investment remained in two small banks while it was one of many options the tarp and more specifically the cpp helped restore confidence in us banks and pave the way for a large scale economic recovery but there is a more dynamic story of how the american banking system survived to rise to where it is today central banks around the globe stepped in dropping interest rates and buying bonds and debt in large measure that came to be known as quantitative easing qe in the united states the federal reserve moved to qe more quickly than its european counterparts beginning qe1 on november 25 2008 with 800 billion in purchases of bank debt u s treasury notes and mortgage backed securities this helped provide additional liquidity and restore a floor to asset prices to address lingering doubts regarding the resiliency of the largest banks a year and a half after the cpp began us bank regulators would make stress testing a household term by announcing the results of the supervisory capital assessment program scap then comptroller of the currency john dugan declared that the results of the stress test demonstrate the strength of the banking system and its ability to withstand losses and sustain lending even if economic conditions are more severe than currently anticipated the scap brought transparency to the condition of the largest banks by naming names and showing in graphic details how each would perform under various scenarios this transparency was an important contributor to rebuilding investor and consumer confidence which was still on the mend policies changed too regulators put new standards for capital and liquidity in place prohibitions against the riskiest practices were established expectations for risk management and governance were raised requirements for stress testing were codified domestic and international policy responses to the crisis were swift and expansive in fighting the flames amidst the crisis each reaction was calibrated to address a particular risk as early as 2011 there were calls to consider the combined effect of regulatory reactions to the crisis particularly on small community banks while the response helped restore the financial system to orderly function the many changes on small community banks resulted in increased regulatory burden even though most community banks in the united states did not engage in the risky practices contributing to the scale of the crisis it would be another seven years before congress and policymakers rebalanced the regulatory framework through the bipartisan leadership of senator mike crapo and the passing of senate bill 2155 the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act commercial banks in the united states also helped themselves and played a meaningful role in recovering from the great recession during the crisis large commercial banks were sources of strength for the banking system and the overall economy they helped triage troubled assets and institutions by buying troubled banks betting on the long term return in open bank solutions that minimized impact on taxpayers and reduced the need for additional government intervention banks and investors also bought the assets of the 414 us banks that failed from 2008 through the end of 2011 from these assets some banks expanded and others built new stronger commercially viable institutions that could continue serving the credit needs of their community s consumers and businesses despite the failures insured deposits did not lose one penny investment banks such as goldman sachs and morgan stanley which operated outside the commercial banking system before the crisis became commercial banks to access federal reserve services banks in the united states also responded responsibly by largely reducing risky activity from their operations us policies and practices require banks to aggressively work through troubled assets as a result american banks acted upon the requirements to deal with 90 day past due or impaired and troubled assets much more quickly than did banks in europe and asia and that helped banks in the united states to rebound more quickly than their global rivals putting us banks in a position of strength as recovery accelerated into growth and opportunity the diversity scale and resiliency of its workforce and consumer base were other inherent advantages that contributed to a quicker recovery in the united states unemployment hit almost 10 percent in 2010 but was cut in half by 2015 unemployment at the end of 2018 was 3 9 percent by comparison unemployment in the eurozone was also roughly 10 percent in 2010 but swelled to more than 12 percent by 2013 and remains near 7 5 percent today nearly double the us rate more people working means more consumer spending and greater ability to service personal debt us household debt compared with gross domestic product gdp reached a high in excess of 90 percent of gdp during the great recession but has receded from that high falling steadily to just more than 75 percent of gdp during the first quarter of 2019 in this case the strength of the nation truly resided in its people those quick actions to respond to weaknesses seen in 2008 and to shore up an economy and put people back to work gave banks in the united states a firm base from which to grow and claw back the advantage that european and asian banks had gained in the 1990s three other forces helped ensure us banks remained an engine for economic opportunity and growth corporate tax rate reductions gave banks a boost in 2018 key interest rates have risen from historic lows and regulators and policymakers have worked to recalibrate the us regulatory framework to retain critical reforms imposed in response to the financial crisis and eliminate unnecessary regulatory burden how far from the brink have us banks come today banks in the united states are as healthy as they have been at any point in my 35 year career the capital to total assets ratio globally hovers around 10 3 percent and in the united states that ratio approaches almost 12 percent return on equity roe exceeded 12 percent at the end of the second quarter of 2019 the highest level since 2006 meanwhile return on equity of eurozone banks hovered around 6 percent at the end of the first quarter of 2019 asset quality among us banks is also approaching pre crisis levels with the overall charge off rate for all loans of commercial banks falling to 47 percent from 3 14 percent at the end of 2009 from that base banks in the united states have flexed their competitive muscle according to the wall street journal banks in the country earned 62 percent of global investment fees in 2018 70 percent of merger fees and 60 percent of stock commissions the efficiency at us banks is greater than at their international counterparts with us banks cost to income cti ratio at about 58 6 in 2018 while the cti for eurozone banks at the end of 2018 was 65 8 percent with german banks at 79 9 france at 68 1 and the united kingdom at 64 7 that all means more money in the bank with profits of the banking sector in the united states increasing by 6 4 percent from a year ago to reach 123 3 billion through the second quarter of 2019 while us banks have come a long way a regulator s primary role is to scan the horizon for storm clouds and identify risk where least expected risk awareness at the office of the comptroller of the currency we have not forgotten the tremendous toll that the financial crisis took on consumers investors and communities today identifying assessing and communicating risks to the federal banking system is a significant part of our job twice a year we publish a semiannual risk perspective that provides a systemic view of risks facing banks and helps set priorities for our bank examiners for the next six to twelve months our most recent publication highlighted four risks credit quality is strong when measured by traditional performance metrics but successive years of growth incremental easing in underwriting risk layering and building credit concentrations have resulted in accumulated risk in loan portfolios operational risk is elevated as banks adapt to a changing and increasingly complex operating environment key drivers for operational risk include cybersecurity threats as well as innovation in financial products and services and increasing use of third parties to support operations that are not effectively understood implemented and controlled compliance risk related to the bank secrecy act anti money laundering bsa aml is high as banks remain challenged to effectively manage money laundering risks interest rate risk and the related liquidity risk implications pose potential challenges to earnings given the uncertain rate environment competitive pressures changes in technology and untested depositor behavior to remain globally competitive and profitable and to continue serving as engines of growth and opportunity banks and regulators must watch these risks closely regulators banks and policy leaders must understand the impact of the comprehensive steps taken in response to the last crisis to restore confidence rebuild capital and provide liquidity acting quickly and decisively not only to stop the deterioration but also to work through troubled assets quickly helped put banks back on firm ground by reestablishing a sound foundation banks were then positioned to do what they do best help create economic opportunity and return financial vibrancy to

concerned investors are returning to an old school investment photo getty images financial times comment gold bugs have always struck me as paranoid you have to really believe the sky is falling in order to hoard physical bars in a digital age so it s rather worrying that some investors and central bankers are talking up gold the dutch central bank recently argued in an article that if there were to be a major monetary reset gold stock can serve as a basis to rebuild the global monetary system gold bolsters confidence in the stability of the central bank s balance sheet and creates a sense of security read more asb slowdown not over yet government needs to do more bank capital changes will cost economy asb warns hawke s bay hits first place on asb economic scoreboard auckland out of the doldrums asb economic survey talk of gold however does not investor ray dalio recently spooked attendees at the institute for international finance conference when he mentioned the possibility of a flight to gold because of his concerns about america s fiscal position that is not a new point since at least 2016 financial titans including jpmorgan chief jamie dimon and hedge fund manager stanley druckenmiller have pointed out that unfunded pension and healthcare entitlements are a looming iceberg for the us economy indeed one theory about the recent crisis in the repo overnight lending market is that it was caused by the federal deficit and the increasing unwillingness of investors outside the us to fund it but mr dalio went further concluding that the american entitlement crisis meant the us federal reserve would have to continue to inflate its own balance sheet indefinitely and keep rates low or even negative well into the future so the us could keep paying its bills that would depreciate the us dollar taken to its extreme that never ends well prior experiments with rapidly falling currencies include late third century rome germany s interwar weimar republic and zimbabwe at some point mr dalio argued nobody would want to own us debt or the dollar and investors would look to other assets for safety the question is what else he asked that s the environment i think that we ll be in and there s a saying that gold is the only asset you can have that s not somebody else s liability i haven t bought any gold yet myself though i did sell out of equities entirely in august that decision has been somewhat painful given the recent upsurge in the s p 500 and yet it is one that i do not regret there is logic in believing as i do that us blue chips and bonds are no longer a safe haven while also believing that prices could stay high for some time to come after all holding two seemingly contradictory thoughts in your head at once is the sign of a mature mind i believe us stock prices are staying up for precisely the same reason that investors might need to be in gold someday analyst luke gromen laid out the mathematical logic of this very well in a recent newsletter he calculates that us annual entitlement payments which he defines as medicare medicaid and social security plus defence spending plus interest on the federal debt adds up to 112 per cent of us federal tax receipts gold creates a sense of security when the economy turns sour photo getty images that total has risen from 103 per cent only 15 months ago and 95 per cent two years ago as government revenue fell due to president donald trump s tax cuts the proceeds of those cuts helped to further inflate equity prices the us has become utterly dependent on asset price inflation for tax receipts mr gromen writes adding that the only way the us will be able pay its yearly bills is for asset prices to climb on their own or for the fed to print enough money to make asset prices rise i expect the fed will like every central bank before it do what is politically required neither the us nor the world can afford for america to nominally default on its treasury bills so stock prices will rise for now the essence of economic policy is as joseph schumpeter reportedly put it politics politics politics share price inflation has been underway since the fed switched gears and began lowering rates in july it will probably be helped along by the easing of financial regulations enacted after the 2008 crisis and possibly even a new round of tax cuts before the 2020 elections mr trump measures his own success by that of the market but in the longer run this financially engineered growth must erode confidence in the dollar particularly at a time when the us and china are going in different directions china is now the world s largest natural gas buyer and is looking to start setting prices for this and other commodities in its own currency china is also doing more business in euros as it tries to woo europe into its own economic orbit china recently issued its first euro denominated bonds in 15 years it is also moving away from buying oil in dollars and strengthening ties with eu companies such as airbus the de dollarisation of eurasia would support mr dalio s worldview so would a shift to a non dollar reserve asset such as gold such a change would force the us to sell dollars in order to settle its balance of payments in the new neutral reserve asset one could argue that even if the us dollar were to weaken and creditors to lose faith in america s ability to repay its debt markets might still remain high for a period of time but we are undergoing a period of deglobalisation and history shows that when that happens it eventually tends to trigger asset price collapses in whatever country is associated with the old order no wonder gold bugs abound written by rana foroohar financial times

share for a total of 5 0 million noteworthy items occurring subsequent to the end of the third quarter third quarter results net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were 100 5 million down 4 1 percent versus the third quarter of fiscal 2019 each division experienced a modest year over year decline in net sales applied technology was unfavorably impacted by the continued challenges in the north american ag market while the decline in engineered films net sales was primarily driven by lower sales into the industrial market aerostar achieved growth in its radar platform but prior year net sales of approximately 2 million in aerostats along with unfavorable timing of stratospheric balloon contracts resulted in a year over year decrease in net sales operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was 11 3 million versus operating income of 13 6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 decreasing 16 7 percent year over year the year over year decline was primarily driven by increased investments in research and development and selling activities and negative operating leverage as a result of lower sales volume operating income included a pre tax gain of 1 9 million on the sale of applied technology s facility in austin texas during the third quarter the company also recognized 0 4 million of transaction expenses related to the acquisition of smart ag and controlling ownership in dot net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was 9 9 million or 0 28 per diluted share versus net income of 13 0 million or 0 36 per diluted share in last year s third quarter the company s effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was 13 0 percent increasing 4 4 percentage points year over year the year over year volatility in the effective tax rate was primarily due to timing of discrete tax items related to the settlement and vesting of equity compensation awards the company s effective tax rate excluding discrete items was 15 3 percent and 3 4 percentage points lower than the third quarter of last year strategic platforms for growth the company recently announced details of its five year strategic plan which includes significant investments in two targeted areas in order to drive a step change in long term earnings growth these two strategic growth platforms raven autonomy and raven composites are directly aligned with the company s business model which is to serve market segments with strong growth prospects in both the near and long term raven autonomy is expected to enable applied technology to capitalize on the rapidly developing market for autonomous agriculture solutions while raven composites is expected to position engineered films to execute on near term opportunities in the ever expanding composites market raven autonomy is expected to propel the company s applied technology division to become the industry leader in autonomous agricultural solutions the company recently announced two transactions acquisition of smart ag and investment in the controlling ownership interest of dot as part of the execution of the raven autonomy strategy these acquisitions will allow the division to build upon its existing machine control technology while innovating smart machine platforms and implements to achieve fully autonomous solutions across the farming enterprise integration efforts are underway for both transactions the company s engineered films division is an industry leader in both high performance plastic films and sheeting raven composites will build on the division s core strengths and expand engineered films to become an industry leader in the adjacent reinforced composites market by leveraging the division s reinforced materials expertise engineered films will innovate solutions that deliver thinner lighter and stronger composites within the transportation construction automotive and packaging markets execution of the strategy will include increased investment in research and development acquisitions partnerships capital expenditures and business development activities in order to execute the company s specific initiatives and strategies for the advancement of raven autonomy and raven composites given the significance of the planned investments it is expected that operating income for the company will be lower during the next two fiscal years fy 2021 and fy 2022 while raven autonomy and raven composites become established and sales ramp the investment in raven autonomy excluding acquisition related expense is expected to add 4 to 5 million in incremental expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 balance sheet and cash flow at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020 cash and cash equivalents totaled 77 1 million increasing 8 0 million from the prior quarter the sequential increase in cash was driven primarily by improved net working capital and facilities optimization during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the company repurchased 169 thousand shares at an average price of 29 50 per share for a total of 5 0 million year to date the company has repurchased 10 8 million of shares the company s remaining repurchase authorization is approximately 17 million applied technology division net sales for applied technology in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were 28 5 million down 4 2 percent year over year unfavorable weather and poor yield conditions during this year s growing season in north america negatively impacted end market demand more than the company had anticipated this weakness in end market demand resulted in additional oem plant shutdowns during the third quarter which drove a 13 5 percent decrease in sales to the oem channel despite these end market challenges the aftermarket channel showed signs of strength and grew 4 8 percent year over year aided by the first shipments of vsn the company s best in class visual guidance technology division operating income in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was 7 0 million down 0 7 million or 9 1 percent versus the third quarter of fiscal 2019 the year over year decrease was driven by negative operating leverage as a result of lower sales volume temporarily higher warranty expenses and increased investments in research and development to support the division s continued commitment to innovation operating income also included a pre tax gain of 1 9 million from the sale of applied technology s facility in austin texas engineered films division net sales for engineered films in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were 56 4 million down 1 8 million or 3 1 percent year over year the division achieved impressive gains in the agriculture construction and installation end markets however these gains were offset by lower sales into the industrial market and challenges in the geomembrane market specifically in the energy sub market division operating income in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was 8 5 million down 0 8 million or 8 3 percent versus the third quarter of fiscal 2019 negative operating leverage on lower sales volume reduced operating income compared to the prior year aerostar division net sales for aerostar in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were 15 7 million down 1 4 million or 8 0 percent versus the third quarter of fiscal 2019 the division achieved growth in its radar platform however the year over year decrease of approximately 2 million in aerostat sales and the unfavorable timing of stratospheric balloon contracts resulted in a year over year decrease in net sales aerostar s sales to government agencies often involve large contracts subject to frequent delays and protracted negotiation processes the timing and size of aerostat contract wins can create volatility in aerostar s results division operating income in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was 2 5 million down 1 4 million versus the third quarter of fiscal 2019 higher selling expenses and increased investment in research and development drove a reduction in operating income as the division continued its investment in advancing its radar and stratospheric balloon technologies additionally operating income was unfavorably impacted by negative operating leverage on lower sales volume year over year market outlook the north american ag market continues to be negatively impacted by unfavorable weather and low commodity prices while u s china trade developments continue to drive uncertainty in the marketplace and negatively impact farmer sentiment these factors have reduced farm income and oems have responded with lower production of new machines in the short term the company does not anticipate improvement in ag market conditions nor an increase in demand for precision agriculture equipment the energy market in the third quarter experienced slower demand compared to prior year s third quarter as west texas intermediate wti oil prices and permian basin rig counts were down 21 percent and 14 percent year over year respectively the company expects energy market related demand for engineered films to follow permian basin rig count trends for the remainder of the year fiscal 2020 outlook applied technology and engineered films performed well in the midst of lower demand while aerostar continues to win new contracts and position itself for strong growth said dan rykhus president and ceo despite the short term challenges we are experiencing this fiscal year the fundamentals within each of our divisions remain very strong and we are well positioned to leverage our market leading technology to capitalize on business development opportunities additionally we recently announced two new strategic platforms for growth raven autonomy and raven composites which are logical extensions of our current technology portfolio and are expected to provide significant incremental growth over the long term applied technology began executing on its strategic platform for growth raven autonomy by acquiring smart ag and a controlling ownership in dot we are very excited about our unique position to execute and deliver value added autonomous agriculture solutions to the marketplace and we look forward to providing updates as we advance raven autonomy additionally the division s existing core business remains strong and is performing well considering the lower end market demand engineered films achieved mixed results across its end markets but continues to position itself for significant growth opportunities within its existing markets raven composites will be incremental to that growth and there are near term opportunities to execute on for raven composites the division is aggressively pursuing strategic acquisitions and expansions in both equipment and facilities and we will provide details as these investments are completed in the near term aerostar has been executing on its strategic plan for growth and is delivering expected results the two newly awarded aerostat contracts provide further evidence of the momentum and strength of aerostar s contract pipeline and the division continues to position itself for significant success in the aerospace and defense market in the near future raven s business model has remained consistent over time however we have made strategic pivots in the company s history that have proven to be very beneficial raven autonomy and raven composites are our next strategic pivot and i can tell you that through my 29 years of experience with raven i ve never seen an opportunity like this for raven concluded

this is the first story in a three part series assets of the ayatollah the 82 year old iranian woman keeps the documents that upended her life in an old suitcase near her bed she removes them carefully and peers at the tiny persian script there s the court order authorizing the takeover of her children s three tehran apartments in a multi story building the family had owned for years there s the letter announcing the sale of one of the units and there s the notice demanding she pay rent on her own apartment on the top floor pari vahdat e hagh ultimately lost her property it was taken by an organization that is controlled by the most powerful man in iran supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei she now lives alone in a cramped three room apartment in europe thousands of miles from tehran the persian name of the organization that hounded her for years is setad ejraiye farmane hazrate emam headquarters for executing the order of the imam the name refers to an edict signed by the islamic republic s first leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini shortly before his death in 1989 his order spawned a new entity to manage and sell properties abandoned in the chaotic years after the 1979 islamic revolution setad has become one of the most powerful organizations in iran though many iranians and the wider world know very little about it in the past six years it has morphed into a business juggernaut that now holds stakes in nearly every sector of iranian industry including finance oil telecommunications the production of birth control pills and even ostrich farming the organization s total worth is difficult to pinpoint because of the secrecy of its accounts but setad s holdings of real estate corporate stakes and other assets total about 95 billion reuters has calculated that estimate is based on an analysis of statements by setad officials data from the tehran stock exchange and company websites and information from the u s treasury department just one person controls that economic empire khamenei as iran s top cleric he has the final say on all governmental matters his purview includes his nation s controversial nuclear program which was the subject of intense negotiations between iranian and international diplomats in geneva that ended sunday without an agreement it is khamenei who will set iran s course in the nuclear talks and other recent efforts by the new president hassan rouhani to improve relations with washington the supreme leader s acolytes praise his spartan lifestyle and point to his modest wardrobe and a threadbare carpet in his tehran home reuters found no evidence that khamenei is tapping setad to enrich himself but setad has empowered him through setad khamenei has at his disposal financial resources whose value rivals the holdings of the shah the western backed monarch who was overthrown in 1979 how setad came into those assets also mirrors how the deposed monarchy obtained much of its fortune by confiscating real estate a six month reuters investigation has found that setad built its empire on the systematic seizure of thousands of properties belonging to ordinary iranians members of religious minorities like vahdat e hagh who is baha i as well as shi ite muslims business people and iranians living abroad setad has amassed a giant portfolio of real estate by claiming in iranian courts sometimes falsely that the properties are abandoned the organization now holds a court ordered monopoly on taking property in the name of the supreme leader and regularly sells the seized properties at auction or seeks to extract payments from the original owners the supreme leader also oversaw the creation of a body of legal rulings and executive orders that enabled and safeguarded setad s asset acquisitions no supervisory organization can question its property said naghi mahmoudi an iranian lawyer who left iran in 2010 and now lives in germany khamenei s grip on iran s politics and its military forces has been apparent for years the investigation into setad shows that there is a third dimension to his power economic might the revenue stream generated by setad helps explain why khamenei has not only held on for 24 years but also in some ways has more control than even his revered predecessor setad gives him the financial means to operate independently of parliament and the national budget insulating him from iran s messy factional infighting washington has acknowledged setad s importance in june the treasury department imposed sanctions on setad and some of its corporate holdings calling the organization a massive network of front companies hiding assets on behalf of iran s leadership the companies generate billions of dollars in revenue a year the department stated but it did not offer a detailed accounting the iranian president s office and the foreign ministry didn t respond to requests for comment iran s embassy in the united arab emirates issued a statement calling reuters findings scattered and disparate and said that none has any basis it didn t elaborate setad s director general of public relations hamid vaezi said by email in response to a detailed description of this series that the information presented is far from realities and is not correct he didn t go into specifics in a subsequent message he said setad disputes the treasury s allegations and is in the process of retaining u s counsel to address this matter he added this communication puts you on notice that any action by your organization could prejudice our dispute in the united states and harm our position for which we hold you responsible when khomeini the first supreme leader set in motion the creation of setad it was only supposed to manage and sell properties without owners and direct much of the proceeds to charity setad was to use the funds to assist war veterans war widows and the downtrodden according to one of its co founders setad was to operate for no more than two years setad has built schools roads and health clinics and provided electricity and water in rural and impoverished areas it has assisted entrepreneurs in development projects but philanthropy is just a small part of setad s overall operations under khamenei s control setad began acquiring property for itself and kept much of the funds rather than simply redistributing them with those revenues the organization also helps to fund the ultimate seat of power in iran the beite rahbar or leader s house according to a former setad employee and other people familiar with the matter the first supreme leader khomeini had a small staff to run the country today khamenei employs about 500 people in his administrative offices many recruited from the military and security services a complete picture of setad s spending and income isn t possible its books are off limits even to iran s legislative branch in 2008 the iranian parliament voted to prohibit itself from monitoring organizations that the supreme leader controls except with his permission but reuters has put together the fullest account yet of the organization s holdings they include a giant property portfolio the head of setad s real estate division said at a ceremony in 2008 that the unit was worth about 52 billion the value of iran s currency has plunged since then while property values have soared the property portfolio has also changed so its current value is hard to establish setad regularly conducts large auctions of its real estate at least 59 to date according to a review of iranian newspaper advertisements and auction websites one recent auction took place in may when nearly 300 properties went on the block including houses stores tracts of farmland and even a spa and pool complex in tehran the required opening bids totaled about 88 million based on the official exchange rate that month an investment unit worth tens of billions of dollars in june the u s treasury department sanctioned setad and 37 companies it controls over the organization s alleged role in assisting the iranian government s circumvention of u s and international sanctions the treasury also said setad played a role in generating revenue for the iranian leadership and that one of its investment companies alone was worth about 40 billion in late 2010 but the june action covered just part of setad s corporate holdings according to a treasury spokesman sanctions only apply to subsidiaries if the targeted entity owns 50 percent or more of a company in practice setad controls many businesses in which it holds very small stakes reuters identified at least 24 public companies in which setad or a company it invested in held less than 50 percent those holdings that are publicly traded are worth more than 3 4 billion reuters calculated that figure includes about 3 billion setad paid in 2009 for a stake in iran s largest telecommunications firm reuters also identified 14 companies setad has invested in directly or through other companies that couldn t be valued because they are not publicly traded all told reuters was able to identify about 95 billion in property and corporate assets controlled by setad that amount is roughly 40 percent bigger than the country s total oil exports last year it also surpasses independent historians estimates of the late shah s wealth after toppling the monarchy the islamic republic filed suit in the united states against the shah and his wife farah pahlavi claiming they had stolen 35 billion in iranian funds according to court records in today s dollars that sum would be worth about 79 billion the suit was dismissed abbas milani director of the iranian studies program at stanford university who wrote a biography of the shah published in 2011 told reuters he believes the estimate of the shah s fortune was extremely exaggerated he said the monarch led a truly opulent lifestyle including owning an automobile collection that may have included 120 fancy vehicles but he wrote in the biography those most likely to know estimate the shah s fortune to be close to a billion dollars with inflation that would equal about 3 billion in today s money a fraction of the worth of setad s holdings protection fees setad officials have offered two justifications for their property activities that the assets were acquired legitimately and part of the profits go to charity in an interview in april with the iranian reformist newspaper shargh ali ashraf afkhami who was identified as the head of tadbir economic development group the main unit that handles setad s financial investments called the organization a custodian of property without owners and suggested that none had been confiscated he also described the way setad had accumulated its real estate as nothing unusual imagine that a property or piece of land has been left behind by someone after their death without any heirs or for example property that has been freed by customs but remains without an owner he said these properties must be managed somehow if the lack of ownership is confirmed through the order of the court then the property is given to setad like i said he added everywhere in the world systems have been created to take control of property or pieces of land that have no owners and the profits are put toward activities for the public good charities have played an important role in the islamic republic setad controls a charity other charitable trusts known as bonyads served as a vital safety net during and after the 1980 1988 iran iraq war assisting disabled veterans widows and orphans and the poor according to the son of one slain soldier bonyad shahid martyrs foundation provided his and other families accommodation wages and household items a list of current veteran services on its website includes discount airplane tickets technical training and the installation of wheelchair lifts on vehicles setad however is a much broader operation than these foundations it s unclear how much of its revenue goes to philanthropy iranians whose properties have been seized by setad as well as lawyers who have handled such cases dispute the argument that the organization is acting in the public interest they described to reuters what amounts to a methodical moneymaking scheme in which setad obtains court orders under false pretenses to seize properties and later pressures owners to buy them back or pay huge fees to recover them the people who request the confiscation introduce themselves as on the side of the islamic republic and try to portray the person whose property they want confiscated as a bad person someone who is against the revolution someone who was tied to the old regime said hossein raeesi a human rights attorney who practiced in iran for 20 years and handled some property confiscation cases the atmosphere there is not fair ross k reghabi an iranian lawyer in beverly hills california said the only hope to recover anything is to pay off well connected agents in iran by the time you pay off everybody it comes to 50 percent of the property s value said reghabi who says he has handled 11 property confiscation cases involving setad an iranian shi ite muslim businessman now living abroad who asked to remain anonymous because he still travels to iran said he attempted two years ago to sell a piece of land near tehran that his family had long owned local authorities informed him that he needed a no objection letter from setad the businessman said he visited setad s local office and was required to pay a bribe of several hundred dollars to the clerks to locate his file and expedite the process he said he then was told he had to pay a fee because setad had protected his family s land from squatters for decades he would be assessed between 2 percent and 2 5 percent of the property s value for every year setad sent an appraiser to determine the property s current worth the appraisal came in at 90 000 the protection fee he said totaled 50 000 the businessman said he balked arguing there was no evidence setad had done anything to protect the land he said the setad representatives wouldn t budge on the amount but offered to facilitate the transaction by selling the land itself to recover its fee he said he hired a lawyer who advised him to pay the fee which he reluctantly did last year this was not the only encounter the businessman s family has had with setad he said his sister who lives in tehran recently told him that setad representatives had gone door to door at her apartment complex demanding occupants show the deeds for their units several other iranians whose family properties were taken over by setad described in interviews how men showed up and threatened to use violence if the owners didn t leave the premises at once one man said he had been told how an elderly family member had stood by distraught as workmen carried out all of the furniture from her home according to this account she sat down on a carpet refused to move and pleaded what can i do where can i go then they reached down lifted her up on the carpet and took her out behind the doors several iranian foundations such as bonyad mostazafan the foundation of the oppressed also have been granted legal authority to confiscate certain properties those organizations generally are open about the practice listing their names and logos in real estate advertisements setad s role in confiscations is more hidden neither setad s logo nor its full name appear in newspaper advertisements listing upcoming auctions instead the organization uses a vague title that doesn t make clear the seller is connected to setad a call by a reporter to one of the phone numbers listed in an advertisement in may for property in the northeastern city of mashhad was greeted by a recording that said you have reached setad ejraiye farmane hazrate emam many of the newspaper ads found by reuters also referred readers to a website for further information that site doesn t contain setad s proper name either internet website ownership records show that the site which lists auctions for many types of confiscated goods including boats motorcycles flat screen televisions automobiles and even fertilizer is registered to an office in tehran when a reporter called it the person who answered confirmed it was setad s office some of the properties under setad s control were confiscated from religious minorities including members of the baha i faith a religion founded in iran that is seen as heretical by the islamic republic baha is are a persecuted religious group in iran with some followers blocked from jobs and universities baha i shops and cemeteries also have been vandalized figures compiled by the united nations office of the baha i international community a non governmental organization show that setad was occupying 73 properties seized from its members as of 2003 the most recent data available the real estate was then worth about 11 million that figure captured only a fraction of the value of baha i properties taken by setad not on the list were several that belonged to a baha i named aminullah katirai according to his daughter heideh katirai who now lives in toronto setad has been pursuing her family s property for more than two decades her father owned a house and land around the city of hamedan in northwest iran she said in the early 1990s setad confiscated about 750 hectares 1 853 acres the family s entire land holdings in the area court records documenting the property seizures that were reviewed by reuters claim katirai had collaborated with the prior government of the shah katirai s daughter says her father never had any ties to the shah s government he tried to appeal to government authorities he wrote a letter to a parliamentary commission in 1993 stating he was being targeted solely because of his religion in a response seen by reuters a commission representative cited article 13 of iran s constitution which says that only zoroastrians jews and christians are recognized as religious minorities and have the right to practice their religion within the limits of the law the baha i faith is not among religion minorities a translation of the letter stated the commission refused to consider his case setad did not stop there according to his daughter setad representatives showed up several years later at a three story building her family had owned in central tehran for 44 years at the time katirai lived on the ground floor and the upper floors were rented out according to his daughter the setad representatives claimed the building s owner had left the country and had abandoned it katirai told the setad representatives repeatedly that he owned the building they left but setad soon began court proceedings to take it over in 2008 katirai died for the past five years setad has been trying to evict the tenants including katirai s son producing court notices and threatening fines each corner of that house is a memory for us said katirai s daughter i took my kids there every friday to see the family what has my family done to deserve this kind of treatment she asked we know that islam is a religion of peace but how can a government that claims to be an islamic government allow this to happen mohammad nayyeri a lawyer who worked in iran until 2010 and now lives in britain said he handled a case involving setad in which a muslim man s house had been confiscated in part based on rumors that he had converted to the baha i faith and had ties with the monarchy the man nayyeri declined to name him because he still has family in iran relocated to the united states soon after the 1979 revolution the new government seized the man s home in a wealthy tehran neighborhood the baha i rumor was one of the triggers of this nayyeri said they found that this house is empty and the owner had left the country so they came and seized the place around 1990 the property was given to setad which sold it at auction nayyeri said that in 2008 the owner s son contacted him by then the man had died the son who told the lawyer his father had never converted to the baha i faith and had no ties to the monarchy wanted to clear his name and try to recover the house nayyeri said he lodged a complaint against setad and the current owner and successfully challenged the original confiscation he ultimately obtained a judicial order that the property be returned to the son but setad refused to give it back unless the son offered a khoms a religious payment mandated under islamic law nayyeri said it totaled 50 000 20 percent of the property s assessed value according to the lawyer the son had no choice and paid it reghabi the iranian lawyer based in california said he too won a number of property seizure cases involving setad but he said no case was simple the hurdles involved not only untangling a property s ownership and challenging decades old court decrees but also identifying and paying off people with connections to the key decision maker the real stuff is what goes on behind the doors he said you have to find the right person reghabi said his clients were responsible for paying the various fees which were all subject to negotiation and could reach millions of dollars he added that he always advised clients whose properties had been sold by setad to try to recover some of the sale proceeds in cash that is my advice to them don t try and be stupid and get your property back come and kill me the case of vahdat e hagh who is baha i involved several iranian organizations over the years but none was more relentless than setad she said she said her troubles began in 1981 when her husband hussein began working for a company called asan gas that had been set up in part to assist unemployed members of the faith in september 1981 he was arrested and imprisoned in tehran according to vahdat e hagh after five months a cleric from a court sentenced him to death with no chance to appeal he was executed in february 1982 he was shot with nine bullets she said her voice cracking to protest her husband s execution she began writing letters to senior government officials including khamenei then iran s president in 1985 she said she was jailed for three months her protests continued including a call to khamenei s office i kept begging them to tape my voice to take my message to khamenei she said instead she said the clerk recorded the conversation and turned the tape over to the intelligence ministry the widow s account of what happened next is supported by legal notices and official correspondence seen by reuters a court later ordered the confiscation of her family s apartments in an affluent area of north tehran her children were out of the country at the time and the court order accused them of proselytizing the baha i faith abroad she said two iranian foundations pressed vahdat e hagh to turn over her properties to them she refused and both eventually dropped the matter she said then in november 1991 setad entered the picture another court authorized it to confiscate the family s properties in tehran and the southern city of shiraz according to vahdat e hagh setad representatives came to her apartment and threatened to beat her if she did not leave one even had his fist balled up one time to punch me she said i told them you can come and kill me in january 1992 setad wrote to the property registry office requesting that the names of vahdat e hagh s children be removed from the deeds to their apartments a year later setad sent a letter to vahdat e hagh offering to sell her one of the units setad ultimately sold the apartment to an official from tehran s revolutionary court she said who flipped it within a month for a quick profit setad later sold three more apartments that belonged to her two other children and late husband in the fall of 1993 vahdat e hagh quietly left iran telling only a few friends and relatives it took six years before setad authorities realized she was no longer living in her apartment which she had been renting out in a letter in november 1999 setad offered to sell her own apartment to her at a discount she refused it then demanded she pay rent on the unit she refused again the organization eventually sold it vahdat e hagh said she later telephoned the new buyer this was my property and my family s property that was built with the blood of myself and my husband she said she told the man she said he offered her some money which out of principle she refused today the building appears to be vacant except for a business on a lower level merchants in the neighborhood said the property s present ownership isn t clear and the building may be under the control of an islamic organization on the top floor where vahdat e hagh once lived most of the windows are broken reuters next part 2

east hartford connecticut federal reserve chairman jerome powell normally spends his days in the marble halls of washington meeting with senators and fed economists on monday he learned about the job market from an 18 year old named jasmine a recent high school graduate jasmine ayala explained to powell how she has just landed a good job as a laser operator at aircraft engine manufacturer pratt whitney after graduation she received seven weeks of training backed by a grant from a local nonprofit called east hartford connects it was an amazing opportunity ayala said her exchange with the chairman of the world s most powerful central bank came during a visit powell paid monday to a hardscrabble neighborhood of east hartford the trip included a neighborhood tour and a meeting with residents to get an up front look at their challenges monday s events are part of an ongoing outreach by the powell fed to representatives of labor unions educators and community development groups many participants have told fed officials that despite entrenched poverty in some areas of the country more disadvantaged americans are finally finding jobs and making economic progress one major reason for that is the existence of training programs like the one that helped ayala since becoming chairman nearly two years ago powell has sent a message seldom heard from his predecessors that the fed should consider the struggles of the lowest income americans in setting its interest rate policies low interest rates generally help sustain a solid job market which in turn can encourage job training efforts as unemployment has reached a nearly a 50 year low of 3 6 more employers are taking more chances on young people without college degrees and are training them we try to create a strong labor market but for some it s not enough powell said after residents told of vital help they have received from east hartford connects including child support assistance that allowed them to re enter the job market they need to be given a chance the notion that the fed should try to sustain the expansion to help the most disadvantaged people might seem self evident but throughout its history the fed whose mandate is to stabilize prices and maximize employment has rarely expressed the need to suit its policies to benefit the least fortunate with unemployment low most of powell s predecessors would have focused on the threat of high inflation and the possibility of raising rates to forestall it the prevailing belief has been that addressing economic inequality or poverty is the purview of congress not the fed what i sense is different is that he sees those benefits to workers as so important that he is less willing to lose those benefits to quell phantom inflation said tim duy an economist at the university of oregon powell still says the fed s main focus is the health of the job market and the stability of prices but as he nears the end of his second year as chairman he has increasingly opened the door to the idea that the fed can also lift up those who still struggle years after an economic expansion has boosted the fortunes of most americans one driver of that change has been the outreach effort the fed launched a year ago as part of a review of its financial tools and strategy in august at an annual gathering of central bankers in jackson hole wyoming powell began his speech by observing how the u s economic expansion the longest on record was finally benefiting working people through higher pay and more plentiful job opportunities his speech took some economists by surprise it is almost inconceivable that powell s predecessors would have begun an important talk on monetary policy this way dean baker an economist at the progressive center for economic and policy research later wrote in a column that called powell a labor day hero powell has explicitly made the plight of the poor and working class part of the fed s agenda baker wrote janet yellen powell s immediate predecessor had begun to raise these issues during her tenure at the 2016 jackson hole conference some of yellen s deputies met with members of fed up an organization that advocates for low rates to support economic growth and hiring but stephanie aaronson director of economic studies at the brookings institution and a former fed economist said powell has linked fed policy more explicitly to issues like inequality ben bernanke who preceded yellen as fed chair spoke about economic inequality but his stated remedies were in areas outside the fed s reach like education and job training and in the past when fed officials would meet with community groups they tended to discuss issues that only indirectly help the economically disadvantaged fairness in bank lending for example the fed s current outreach is actually about monetary policy and that does make it really different from the usual types of interactions that the fed has with community groups aaronson said aaronson co authored research this spring that found that a persistently low unemployment rate can significantly narrow employment gaps between whites and african americans and latinos her research also found that the narrowing of that gap accelerated as unemployment fell further in east hartford s school system nearly half the students are latino chela gage director of talent acquisition at pratt whitney which is based in east hartford said the persistence of low unemployment has led the company to think more creatively about hiring we are stretching our arms to see where the talent lies she said ayala was working part time while still in high school applying make up at weddings and other events for 10 10 an hour that income helped her family and she wasn t sure she could have given it up for training without the stipend she received her new job at pratt whitney pays 29 an hour she s also attending school at night to earn her bachelor s degree things don t happen unless you work hard she said j w mason an assistant professor at john jay college said that fed officials haven t often acknowledged that their policies have varying consequences for different socioeconomic groups many economists have long argued for example that when the fed raises rates to try to stop prices from accelerating it risks hindering the kind of robust job market that disproportionately helps disadvantaged workers it s not just about the whole economy mason said it s about who s benefiting it s always been true but people didn t want to acknowledge it

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by hari kishan bengaluru reuters the era of rock bottom interest rates is not yet over but the powerful boost given to global property prices by easy policy since the financial crisis appears to be ending according to reuters polls of over 100 housing market experts more than a decade of easy money has pushed most asset prices to record highs including house prices which have climbed each year at many multiples of consumer price inflation and wage gains making many markets unaffordable for first time buyers related stories the change in sensitivity to interest rates is not universal but it is particularly notable in the united states where the federal reserve has cut rates three times this year with no major boost to the housing market outlook the combined findings of the latest reuters polls taken this month have implications for the effectiveness of future monetary policy in one of the most typically rate sensitive sectors of most developed and developing economies that may be all the more relevant given many central banks had made scant progress in raising rates back to what would have been considered normal levels before the global financial crisis erupted more than a decade ago monetary policy s ability to stimulate housing demand is far less effective than earlier in the cycle said scott anderson chief economist at the bank of the west of the seven closely watched housing markets polled by reuters the u s britain china india canada australia and dubai none were rated by analysts as fairly priced and particularly in big cities broadly speaking where house prices are rising analysts expect them to be tame next year and to be more reliant on incomes rather than the cheap cost of borrowing i think the issue really in most markets is we ve had a big upward price adjustment over the past 10 years because of ultra low rates and that process is sort of hitting its natural limits what needs to happen is you need to have prices driven by wage inflation said liam bailey global head of research at knight frank analysts expect house prices in the u s and the uk to rise over the next two years but at a slower pace than what was predicted three months ago and dubai property prices are expected to tumble further until 2021 trade friction while each property market is naturally facing its own set of domestic challenges a common concern is a renewed global slowdown and trade friction stemming from the u s china trade war part of the extra froth in property markets since the crisis has been founded in easy cross border investment over the last few months we ve started hearing a lot more from firms about that uncertainty having a negative impact even if firms aren t dealing directly with china said scott brown chief economist at raymond james referring to how trade friction has hit the u s economy u s house price inflation has slowed over the past year and a half roughly coinciding with the opening salvos of the ongoing u s china trade conflict property prices and turnover in the uk have taken a knock particularly in london since the shock vote in 2016 to leave the european union and any price rises in the coming year are expected to lag inflation in china and india which together make up about 40 of the world s population and have some of its fastest growth rates house prices are expected to rise by about 3 next year barely above consumer price inflation in one and below it in the other but the trade war and an ongoing liquidity crisis in india s banking sector will likely drag on those respective property markets until recent years they were booming and made significant contributions to economic growth both through construction and transactions as well as household wealth median 2020 house price forecasts for canada and india were upgraded modestly australia was a notable exception where expectations for next year doubled to 5 over the last three months following a burst of activity thanks in part to reserve bank of australia interest rate cuts but even analysts there were skeptical about how long the rebound would carry on despite the current global economic slowdown affecting most economies oversupply seems to be an issue largely confined to emerging markets in advanced economies like the u s and britain the opposite is true most notably in the u s where a dearth of new homes has been an issue for years and despite strong demand supply is not expected to improve significantly anytime soon the u s is pretty advanced in its cycle construction levels are peaking now but demand is pretty robust said jeremy kelly director of global research at jll reporting by hari kishan additional reporting by vivek mishra indradip ghosh sujith pai nagamani lingappa mumal rathore sarmista sen khushboo mittal in bengalaru and jonathan cable in london editing by ross finley and ed osmond

bloomberg in early 2018 the founders of chinese artificial intelligence startup sensetime group ltd flew to tokyo to see billionaire investor masayoshi son as they entered the offices chief executive officer xu li was hoping to persuade the head of softbank group to invest 200 million in his three year old startup a third of the way into the presentation son interrupted to say he wanted to put in 1 billion a few minutes later son suggested 2 billion turning to the roomful of softbank managers son said this was the kind of ai company he d been looking for why are you only telling me about them now he asked according to one person in the room in the end softbank invested 1 2 billion helping to transform sensetime into the world s most valuable ai startup the young company s valuation hit 7 5 billion this year advertisement advertisement that investment model is now under fire after son 62 boosted the equity in office sharing startup wework only to see it plummet as investors balked at enormous losses and troublesome governance indeed softbank has participated along with other investors in scores of fundraisings that have added a total of more than 150 billion to the value of private companies according to bloomberg calculations among its deals are the world s top two startups bytedance inc valued at 75 billion and didi chuxing inc at about 56 billion in some cases softbank s involvement in multiple funding rounds helped drive up valuations that resulted in paper profits for son s company the wework fiasco raises questions about such numbers the co working startup s valuation crested at 47 billion this year with softbank s investment then plummeted to 7 8 billion in a bailout engineered by son wework is slashing jobs and scaling back operations wework is not just a mistake it is a signal of weakness in the whole model said aswath damodaran a professor of finance at new york university s stern school of business who has written four books on valuing businesses if you screwed up that valuation so badly what about all of the other companies in your portfolio softbank said wework is an exception rather than a symptom of broader problems and it has learned from the experience advertisement advertisement since unveiling his 100 billion vision fund in 2016 son has become the most active tech investor on the planet pouring money into more than 80 companies that helped create a bumper crop of unicorns more than 300 startups priced at 1 billion or greater according to the research firm cb insights story continues what s not as well understood is the incentive son has to keep valuations rising when softbank buys shares in a startup and then invests again at a higher valuation son says he has made a profit that is legal under accounting standards but softbank receives no money the only change is that softbank has boosted the value of its original stake from say 1 billion to 2 billion by raising the value of the startup in softbank s income statements and return calculations at least some of the additional 1 billion can be counted as profit my brain and my heart almost everything about myself is focusing on vision fund they pump up valuations to get higher returns to look good to investors says eric schiffer chief executive officer of patriarch organization a los angeles based private equity fund that kind of fundraising apparatus is essentially unicorn porn softbank said its accounting complies with all standards and is consistent with widely accepted practices as for startup valuations it said it is not determining them on its own and invests with experienced firms such as sequoia capital and temasek holdings pte our valuations have been validated by more than 120 sophisticated investors who ve invested alongside and after us navneet govil chief financial officer of sb investment advisers the entity that manages the vision fund said in a statement advertisement advertisement softbank said it has a rigorous internal process for setting valuations and it books profit on any increase in valuation only after taking into account future cash flows and public market proxies as well as private market funding prices softbank s auditors at deloitte touche check those calculations and the vision fund s limited partners have their own auditors including staff from duff phelps and ernst young who vet the final figures our valuation process is robust and reviewed quarterly by independent auditors govil said we believe our performance is strong in just two and a half years vision fund 1 has already had seven ipos 4 7 billion of realized gains 11 4 billion in cumulative investment gains and returned 9 9 billion to our limited partners today s accounting rules may be ill suited to an era of unprecedented speculation on unicorns under the international financial reporting standards ifrs that softbank uses companies have wide latitude to determine how much they think portfolio companies are worth and therefore how much profit they report to investors it s unclear whether any company has tried to determine paper profits for tech startups on the scale softbank is now using i don t believe we ve ever seen an attempt to record this magnitude of income with respect to unquoted equity investments said robert willens a tax expert in new york son s bookkeeping has allowed him to claim his average internal rate of return far outpaces those of other investors this month as softbank took a hit from wework son defended his investment approach there are 5 000 venture capitals globally and average irr is 13 he said our return is about twice as big as this son s confidence in his own acumen led to the creation of the vision fund in 2017 which at the time was more than 10 times the size of any venture capital fund he was seeking to repeat the success of his most celebrated investment a 20 million bet on china s alibaba group holding ltd that turned into stock now worth more than 120 billion advertisement advertisement with abu dhabi s mubadala and saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman backing the vision fund son began a blitzkrieg of deals in 2017 he invested more than 35 billion across about 100 companies according to research firm preqin among the biggest were multi billion dollar fundings of wework and didi chuxing the chinese ride hailing giant modeled after uber technologies inc in december a softbank led group invested 9 billion in uber including buying stock from existing shareholders softbank began including financial results for the vision fund during the fiscal year that ended in march 2018 total operating profit including a related delta fund was 303 billion yen or less than 3 billion that surged to 1 26 trillion yen the following year making it the most profitable unit at son s company and accounting for more than half the parent company s operating income with son s energy directed at startups softbank spun off the domestic telecom business that had made it famous and generated cash for his early investments my brain and my heart almost everything about myself is focusing on vision fund son told investors in may but the profits softbank booked were mostly on paper in the first fiscal year unrealized gains on investment valuations accounted for essentially all the stated income for the vision and delta funds in the most recent fiscal year unrealized gains on valuations amounted to 1 trillion yen while realized gains like the sale of india e commerce giant flipkart to walmart inc totaled less than 300 billion yen advertisement advertisement wework underscores the risks of that approach softbank first took a stake in august 2017 at a valuation of 21 billion it then invested another 3 billion in november 2018 at a 45 billion valuation and later agreed to a 1 5 billion warrant at 47 billion as son reported results this may he highlighted wework as an example of portfolio companies heading for ipos when the deal fell apart softbank took a 498 billion yen hit softbank vision fund said it never took profits from wework by marking it all the way up to 47 billion it kept the shares on its books at about half that price it still had to take that down by about 75 which led to the loss venture capital and private equity firms are mostly private so they don t need to report quarterly profits to public shareholders and their limited partners are typically focused on returns when portfolio companies cash out through ipos or acquisitions softbank doesn t reveal specific valuation changes for each of its portfolio companies in a quarter typically only naming a few winners or losers investors putting money in alongside softbank are at times affiliates like grab didi and alibaba if i m an investor i want to know how they are coming up with these numbers otherwise you can t believe any of the valuations said nyu s damodaran the more they talk about accountants the less i would trust the numbers advertisement advertisement softbank concluded that under ifrs rules the vision fund must count valuation changes as income because its primary business is investing and softbank group must incorporate that income in its books because the vision fund is a consolidated subsidiary one person close to the company said the resulting profit figures are almost meaningless but there is no better accounting method given the current rules i m not an accountant or a lawyer but presenting this as income doesn t make any sense said ilya strebulaev a professor of finance at stanford university s graduate school of business whose research suggests the latest post money valuations typically overvalue startups by about 50 adding to the complexity is that startup stakes are sometimes transferred between softbank group and the vision fund which have different shareholders the price at which those assets are shifted has implications for profits on either side after wework other deals are coming under scrutiny softbank invested in didi chuxing in 2015 with the chinese company s valuation at about 6 billion it then put more money in about once a year as didi s valuation climbed to 56 billion advertisement advertisement but didi has run into trouble since the fundraising two years ago chinese regulators have cracked down on ride hailing services for drawing migrant workers into big cities and hurting taxi drivers incomes two passengers were killed after using its car pooling service prompting a government suspension in addition investors have grown skeptical about ride hailing after the roughly 35 slump in uber s shares since its may ipo uber s drop means softbank should probably mark down didi by at least the same margin said one person who has worked on deals with softbank the japanese company would also have to look at its investments in other ride sharing companies such as grab holdings inc in southeast asia the person said didi declined to comment a grab spokeswoman said there has been no change in its valuation and it has diversified beyond ride hailing softbank took a loss in its most recent earnings report on its uber stake but made no mention of the other ride hailing firms in its portfolio it did cut the estimated value of its stakes in didi and other ride hailing services in the most recent quarter according to one person close to the company softbank said it can t disclose the loss or gain on every portfolio company each quarter softbank said didi is an example of how it is not responsible for propelling startup valuations because silicon valley s silver lake management invested alongside softbank at the same price toyota motor corp and booking holdings inc then bought shares at a higher valuation advertisement advertisement in the u s food delivery firm doordash inc struggled to distinguish itself from rivals and hadn t hit the 1 billion unicorn mark until softbank invested in the company last year then in just over a year doordash s valuation went from 1 4 billion to 12 6 billion this may when softbank reported earnings the next quarter it highlighted doordash as one of the main contributors to its operating income perhaps softbank s most controversial deal after wework is an indian startup called oyo that was founded six years ago by teenager ritesh agarwal it aimed to bring reliable quality to the country s chaotic lodging industry oyo staff help hoteliers upgrade everything from furniture to bedding and toiletries and the hotel or guest house gets a bright red oyo sign as a seal of approval encouraging travelers to book oyo takes a cut of roughly 25 while softbank backed oyo from its early days some people close to the company worry that son s relationship with agarwal is similar to his ties to wework co founder adam neumann and that he may be making similar mistakes the vision fund put 250 million into oyo in 2017 and led a 1 billion funding round last year which pushed the indian company s valuation to 5 billion son encouraged agarwal to expand into markets such as china and the u s and to buy properties including the hooters casino in las vegas for 135 million stephen givens an m a lawyer in tokyo argues that oyo s business model resembles wework s a tech inflected real estate business that has expanded far beyond its initial concept oyo made sense in a place like india he said but moving into the u s and buying real estate is a big risk advertisement advertisement even as softbank ran into trouble with wework it helped push up the valuation of oyo with an unusual funding round in october the japanese company and agarwal together chipped in raising the valuation to 10 billion softbank touted the startup as a bright spot when it took the writedown for wework booking a valuation gain of 590 billion yen on 25 investments of which oyo was the only one named my brain and my heart almost everything about myself is focusing on vision fund yet it turned out that agarwal now 26 had borrowed 2 billion to finance his share of the purchase from financial institutions including japan s mizuho financial group inc people familiar with the matter have said son himself personally guaranteed the loans to agarwal according to another person familiar with the matter mizuho declined to comment in addition two earlier investors in oyo were didi and grab the ride hailing companies backed by softbank that raises the question of whether money used to boost their valuations was then reused to hike the value of another softbank investment softbank did not disclose son s personal role in the deal or the bank loans to agarwal ultimately the vision fund decided it wouldn t mark up its oyo stock to the 10 billion valuation because the latest funding did not include independent investors in a statement oyo said it is grateful for the support of investors including the vision fund we are a well run company with a healthy balance sheet and a strong focus on business economics and the same can be seen in the continued momentum we ve seen in reducing our net losses it said we have great business relationships with both didi and grab since late 2017 and early 2018 when the fundraising had not happened analysts trying to make sense of softbank s valuations have been frustrated by what they view as a lack of transparency in such cases softbank doesn t discuss in detail the standards by which it values a particular startup or accounts for such gains as profit on its income statement softbank has offered little visibility into how they value their investments says jefferies group senior analyst atul goyal masafumi takeno represented japan on the ifrs foundation committee that developed materials explaining how to use valuation guidelines he said companies have broad discretion to determine asset values and disclosures the rules are pretty loose and permissive he said for years son has expressed frustration that investors don t see the value of his business in presentations he will often focus in on how softbank s market capitalization is below the value of its assets including publicly traded stocks like alibaba in february he opened an event with a slide that showed 25 4 9 the point he was making is that softbank held assets worth 25 trillion yen including a 12 5 billion yen stake in alibaba and had only 4 trillion yen in debt yet investors bestowed a value of 9 trillion yen on softbank a discount of more than 60 it s just beginner math son said this is too cheap the softbank discount narrowed after that presentation with the help of a stock buyback and the impending ipos for companies like uber on its website son s company ran daily calculations of assets minus debt to show what the share price should be but with the wework implosion softbank s market cap has dropped back below 9 trillion yen and the discount has widened again to more than 60 the stock has dropped 30 since its april peak though it s still up 15 for the year shares reversed morning gains on tuesday and dropped almost 1 markets are telegraphing that the trust is gone said nyu s damodaran masa needs to rebuild that

presidential hopefuls elizabeth warren and bernie sanders want to tear up your student loans and set you financially free that s popular among voters especially those struggling to pay off this debt other democratic candidates have more modest plans but economists say the dramatic proposals from sanders and warren to free millions of americans from the burden of student debt could boost the economy in significant ways and help combat income inequality warren would forgive up to 50 000 for most people sanders would go further with total loan forgiveness but with these plans having a price tag north of 1 trillion such legislation would come with plenty of risks the reason debt forgiveness could have a big impact on the overall economy is that a generation of americans is making major life decisions differently because of student loans children it s not about if you want them says laura greenwood in montpelier vt it s about can you afford them greenwood works for the state education agency she s 30 years old and makes 63 000 a year i make probably a better salary than a lot of my peers but after paying for college and grad school greenwood owes 96 000 in student loans and she says that s got her and her partner feeling frozen yeah it s always we re interested in having kids but just cost of living and all our other bills and then the student loans it s just like the final straw she says it makes starting a family feel impossible so if people like greenwood suddenly had this millstone of debt lifted from their necks it stands to reason that would unleash pent up desires and spending that would be good for the economy a lot more people would have kids or start businesses or buy houses in the short term it would be very positive for the housing market says lawrence yun the national association of realtors chief economist he says his group s surveys show that student debt has people delaying homeownership by five to seven years he s not endorsing any particular plan but he estimates that broad loan forgiveness would push up the number of home sales quite a bit home sales could be say 300 000 higher annually if people were not saddled with large student debt yun says that would be a boost to the housing sector as well as the economy the effects would go beyond the housing market william foster is a vice president with moody s which just did a report on student debt forgiveness there ve been some estimates that u s real gdp could be boosted on average by 86 billion to 108 billion per year which is quite a bit he says that s if you had total loan forgiveness foster says it wouldn t have to be total forgiveness to see significant results and he says it could also help address rising income inequality student loans are now contributing to what s perceived as lower economic prospects for younger americans foster says after all millions of people are delaying homeownership and that s the most powerful way for most working and middle class people to build wealth a typical homeowner has net worth about 230 000 while a typical renter has only 5 000 yun says but while the idea of loan forgiveness is enticing it would not be free and this is a big reason plenty of politicians and policy experts are not on board this would be expensive foster says americans owe a lot of money on those student loans about 1 5 trillion and that s more than auto loans and credit cards they re the second biggest debt item for households foster says most of these loans are from the federal government and it could forgive them but that would mean giving up the 85 billion in annual revenue it s currently collecting on these loans and he says that would result in a wider fiscal deficit also taxing people to make up the difference would be a drag on the economy economists say whether the boost from the stimulus of debt forgiveness was stronger than the drag from raising the revenue another way would depend on the details of the legislation should it come about and there are other issues many people would oppose a giveaway to say lawyers and doctors who stand to make a lot of money in the future but happen to have a lot of student loan debt and you probably wouldn t want to tax the working class to pay for higher income college graduates loan forgiveness that s why presidential candidates are proposing to tax the wealthy to pay for it which by the way foster says would also create less drag on the economy from the taxes because wealthy people s spending patterns are less influenced by such changes than people in lower income brackets foster says there could also be what s called a moral hazard factor here for future students those students might expect future loan forgiveness and therefore they ll take out even more money than they might have otherwise that could create even greater levels of student debt so there are plenty of potential pitfalls in all this but policymakers who are pushing for loan forgiveness say they have plans to make it both fair and good for the economy and to do it in a way to make education more affordable for future students so they wouldn t have to take on so much debt
federal reserve board chairman jerome powell front left speaks with fifth grader brian rosa 11 of east hartford conn during a visit to silver lane elementary school monday nov 25 2019 in east hartford rosa said he would like to be a banker when he grows up ap photo steven senne east hartford ap federal reserve chairman jerome powell normally spends his days in the marble halls of washington meeting with senators and fed economists on monday he learned about the job market from an 18 year old named jasmine a recent high school graduate jasmine ayala explained to powell how she has just landed a good job as a laser operator at aircraft engine manufacturer pratt whitney after graduation she received seven weeks of training backed by a grant from a local nonprofit called east hartford connects it was an amazing opportunity ayala said her exchange with the chairman of the world s most powerful central bank came during a visit powell paid monday to a hardscrabble neighborhood of east hartford the trip included a neighborhood tour and a meeting with residents to get an up front look at their challenges monday s events are part of an ongoing outreach by the powell fed to representatives of labor unions educators and community development groups many participants have told fed officials that despite entrenched poverty in some areas of the country more disadvantaged americans are finally finding jobs and making economic progress one major reason for that is the existence of training programs like the one that helped ayala since becoming chairman nearly two years ago powell has sent a message seldom heard from his predecessors that the fed should consider the struggles of the lowest income americans in setting its interest rate policies low interest rates generally help sustain a solid job market which in turn can encourage job training efforts as unemployment has reached a nearly a 50 year low of 3 6 percent more employers are taking more chances on young people without college degrees and are training them we try to create a strong labor market but for some it s not enough powell said after residents told of vital help they have received from east hartford connects including child support assistance that allowed them to re enter the job market they need to be given a chance the notion that the fed should try to sustain the expansion to help the most disadvantaged people might seem self evident but throughout its history the fed whose mandate is to stabilize prices and maximize employment has rarely expressed the need to suit its policies to benefit the least fortunate with unemployment low most of powell s predecessors would have focused on the threat of high inflation and the possibility of raising rates to forestall it the prevailing belief has been that addressing economic inequality or poverty is the purview of congress not the fed what i sense is different is that he sees those benefits to workers as so important that he is less willing to lose those benefits to quell phantom inflation said tim duy an economist at the university of oregon powell still says the fed s main focus is the health of the job market and the stability of prices but as he nears the end of his second year as chairman he has increasingly opened the door to the idea that the fed can also lift up those who still struggle years after an economic expansion has boosted the fortunes of most americans one driver of that change has been the outreach effort the fed launched a year ago as part of a review of its financial tools and strategy in august at an annual gathering of central bankers in jackson hole wyo powell began his speech by observing how the u s economic expansion the longest on record was finally benefiting working people through higher pay and more plentiful job opportunities his speech took some economists by surprise it is almost inconceivable that powell s predecessors would have begun an important talk on monetary policy this way dean baker an economist at the progressive center for economic and policy research later wrote in a column that called powell a labor day hero powell has explicitly made the plight of the poor and working class part of the fed s agenda baker wrote janet yellen powell s immediate predecessor had begun to raise these issues during her tenure at the 2016 jackson hole conference some of yellen s deputies met with members of fed up an organization that advocates for low rates to support economic growth and hiring but stephanie aaronson director of economic studies at the brookings institution and a former fed economist said powell has linked fed policy more explicitly to issues like inequality ben bernanke who preceded yellen as fed chairman spoke about economic inequality but his stated remedies were in areas outside the fed s reach like education and job training and in the past when fed officials would meet with community groups they tended to discuss issues that only indirectly help the economically disadvantaged fairness in bank lending for example the fed s current outreach is actually about monetary policy and that does make it really different from the usual types of interactions that the fed has with community groups aaronson said aaronson co authored research this spring that found that a persistently low unemployment rate can significantly narrow employment gaps between whites and african americans and latinos her research also found that the narrowing of that gap accelerated as unemployment fell further in east hartford s school system nearly half the students are latino chela gage director of talent acquisition at pratt whitney which is based in east hartford said the persistence of low unemployment has led the company to think more creatively about hiring we are stretching our arms to see where the talent lies she said ayala was working part time while still in high school applying make up at weddings and other events for 10 10 an hour that income helped her family and she wasn t sure she could have given it up for training without the stipend she received her new job at pratt whitney pays 29 an hour she s also attending school at night to earn her bachelor s degree things don t happen unless you work hard she said j w mason an assistant professor at john jay college said that fed officials haven t often acknowledged that their policies have varying consequences for different socioeconomic groups many economists have long argued for example that when the fed raises rates to try to stop prices from accelerating it risks hindering the kind of robust job market that disproportionately helps disadvantaged workers it s not just about the whole economy mason said it s about who s benefiting it s always been true but
