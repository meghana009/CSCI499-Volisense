introduction within weeks of his inauguration as president of the philippines in june 2016 rodrigo r duterte became the most internationally known filipino leader since ferdinand marcos the country s infamous dictator and corazon aquino the iconic housewife turned president who championed the restoration of democracy in 1986 a great deal of media attention has been paid to duterte s murderous war on drugs as well as to his often crass and controversial statements his embrace of china and his visceral disdain for the united states has garnered additional attention in foreign policy circles and he frequently is included in media reports and scholarly articles on the rise of populism globally david g timberman david g timberman is an independent scholar and development practitioner who has addressed the challenges of democratic politics and governance in southeast asia for over thirty years although the attention to duterte and his brutal drug war is warranted much less attention has been paid to his administration s broader policy agenda its approach to politics and governance and its broader impact on democratic institutions and norms as a candidate duterte promised that he would produce real and rapid improvements in the lives of filipinos particularly by aggressively addressing crime and corruption two and a half years into his presidency it is both warranted and possible to assess what has and has not changed under duterte the picture is a mixed one with elements of change continuity and regression the duterte government s track record regarding human rights and democracy is undoubtedly disturbing it has run roughshod over human rights its political opponents and the country s democratic institutions the combination of the philippines powerful presidency and the malleability of most of its political institutions is resulting in significant democratic backsliding but to focus only on duterte fails to appreciate two other important elements the extent to which this degradation has happened through nominally legal means and the limited pushback to date by groups and institutions opposed to strongman rule this working paper takes an in depth look at the complex dynamics contributing to democratic backsliding in the philippines the duterte administration s assault on human rights and democracy also raises the question of what the u s government and america s nongovernmental organizations ngos can and should do to defend democracy in america s former colony the analysis concludes with a discussion of america s extremely limited support for human rights and democracy in the philippines since duterte became president and offers suggestions for a more robust response antecedents to begin to make sense of duterte and his approach to politics and governing it is necessary to understand three aspects of contemporary philippine politics the mixed record of elite democracy since 1986 the successes and shortcomings of the benigno aquino iii administration 2010 2016 and the particularities of the 2016 presidential election the mixed record of elite democracy liberal democracy a legacy of america s colonization of the philippines which lasted from 1898 to 1946 has always struggled to become deeply rooted in the country the reasons given for this include cultural factors the power of familial and clientelistic ties religious beliefs catholic fatalism colonial legacies america s empowerment of a land owning elite socioeconomic conditions persistent poverty and inequality and institutional factors a presidential system with winner take all elections between 1946 and 1972 democracy struggled under the weight of elite competition and avarice flawed economic policymaking poor governance and armed insurgency in 1972 then president ferdinand marcos declared martial law and until 1986 democracy was dispensed with in favor of a dictatorship for nearly fifteen years the philippines experienced unprecedented repression and corruption the return to democracy following the people power revolution in february 1986 restored many of the pre martial law era institutional features and political elites although it is generally accurate to view 1986 as a return to elite democracy philippine society the state and modes of political competition have changed since 1972 still even the most positive views of democracy in the philippines since 1986 see it as a flawed work in progress harsher critics see it as a sham and a failure commonly cited flaws include elections tainted by violence and vote buying widespread rent seeking and corruption policies that have benefited elites and special interests at the expense of the poor majority and a dysfunctional justice system however since 1986 democracy has been institutionalized in many ways and at times has worked fairly well liberal values were central to the nonviolent people power revolution and informed the drafting of the 1987 constitution this resulted in constitutional guarantees of human rights regular competitive elections for local and national offices a system of checks and balances and a free if flawed media and robust civil society the philippine military remains somewhat politicized but since 1992 it has been reluctant to directly intervene in politics beginning in 1986 substantial deregulation and privatization as well as economic integration set the stage for strong growth in the philippines gross domestic product gdp over most of the past decade but even observers who applaud the post 1986 reforms have questioned if they have been broad and deep enough to produce fundamental improvements in politics governance and the economy presidents political elites and oligarchs from 1935 when the philippines became a semiautonomous commonwealth the behavior of presidents and other powerful political and economic elites has heavily influenced the quality of the country s democratic politics and governance 1 the philippines is a unitary state with a winner take all electoral system a presidency that exercises huge power over budgets and appointments and congenitally weak political parties as a result the president plays a central role in determining policy outcomes as well as the norms and behavior that shape politics and governance the second important influence on democracy in the philippines is the country s remarkably resilient political and economic elite the president is limited to a single six year term so the power and influence of individual presidents is transitory by contrast political and business families such as the marcoses cojuangcos aquinos and ayalas to name just a few have had noteworthy longevity and adaptability 2 they exert a powerful influence over elections legislation policymaking regulatory bodies jurisprudence and the distribution of government resources for decades this elite has thwarted the development of a strong state by limiting the government s fiscal base and co opting corrupting or intimidating the bureaucracy it has stunted and distorted the philippine economy preferring collusion and protection over economic competition and has been slow and selective in opening the economy to foreign competition because elites dominate legislative and policymaking processes successive governments have failed to adopt and implement socioeconomic policies that address the needs of the poor and middle class with a gini coefficient of 0 43 the philippines has long been one of the most unequal societies in asia with one of the highest levels of poverty incidence among asia s developing economies even after more than a decade of relatively strong macroeconomic growth the incidence of poverty decreased only a little to 21 6 percent in 2015 3 today by the world bank s metrics the philippines is a lower middle income country with a per capita income of 3 600 and a consumption driven economy that has been growing at about 6 5 percent per year for most of the past decade fueled by remittances and a growing business process outsourcing sector 4 as a result the country s sizable predominantly urban middle class now comprises 15 to 20 percent of the population 5 in sum over the past quarter century the rich have become richer the middle class has grown but remains insecure and about one quarter of the population remains poor the aquino government and limits of reformism the real change promised by rodrigo duterte has obscured how much positive change occurred under the administration of benigno aquino iii 2010 2016 6 aquino s promise to follow the straight path was an effort to both appropriate his mother s corazon aquino perceived integrity and draw a sharp contrast with the pervasive corruption associated with the administration of gloria macapagal arroyo 2001 2010 7 notable successes of the aquino government included passing reproductive health and sin tax reform laws implementing twelve years of basic education extending public finance reform expanding fiscal space and social spending and making an effort to provide greater autonomy to muslims in mindanao gdp growth reached 6 5 percent and by virtually every measure the country s international standing improved significantly as a result aquino remained popular throughout most of his term to be sure there also were significant shortcomings and mistakes macroeconomic growth was slow to reduce poverty and the government was unable to rapidly improve infrastructure especially in traffic clogged metro manila it did little to reform dysfunctional food and agriculture policies and could have done more to strengthen anticorruption institutions and to pass a freedom of information law in terms of governance aquino was widely seen as honest but he sometimes valued loyalty over competence and occasionally seemed to lack the empathy that filipinos expect from their political leaders his administration also suffered from complacency due to the president s personal popularity problems communicating its accomplishments and its failure to make the liberal party a more coherent and durable political party and when it came time to choose a successor aquino remained committed to supporting manuel mar roxas his secretary of the department of the interior and local government dilg even though opinion polls consistently indicated that roxas would not win 8 duterte and the promise of real change on may 10 2016 rodrigo duterte then seventy one years old was elected president winning 39 percent of the vote in a five way race charismatic blunt and frequently profane duterte combined a dirty harry persona with a track record as a successful mayor of davao city mindanao s largest city although duterte might appear to be unsophisticated and crude he is politically savvy and attuned to the attitudes and concerns of average filipinos he ran on his reputation as an effective no nonsense mayor of davao who prioritized law and order over legal protections for alleged criminals the overarching theme of duterte s campaign was that his strong leadership would produce rapid change during his campaign he heaped criticism on the manila based elite vowed to undertake a nationwide assault on illegal drugs and criminality and promised to change the government to a federal system his victory over mar roxas who placed a distant second signaled that the promise of change was more compelling than continuity even though duterte had been popular in mindanao before he ran for president his victory showed that his appeal spanned regions and socioeconomic classes the 16 6 million filipinos who voted for him appeared to believe that he could deliver real change duterte s victory surprised many and shocked some in the wake of his election political analysts have grappled with what it says about contemporary philippine politics the reasons why he won are complex suggesting that cautious and nuanced conclusions are warranted first the incumbent benigno aquino the embodiment of reformist elite democracy could not run for a second term if he had been able to run it might have been a very different outcome 9 second the philippine election law has no provision for run offs so there is no incentive to form coalition tickets had mar roxas and senator grace poe the two most like minded candidates joined forces they might have been able to defeat duterte third duterte ran a savvy and effective campaign he announced his candidacy late so the media had little time to scrutinize his record as mayor and his rivals had much less chance to attack him his campaign mobilized large numbers of volunteers and used social media well fourth all four of duterte s opponents had significant negatives in contrast duterte because of his personality and message was an attention grabbing and compelling candidate who was able to tap into and to some extent manipulate middle class frustrations and latent anxiety particularly about drugs and crime 10 although the assertions of middle class frustration seem valid for anyone who has lived in metro manila cebu or the handful of other cities that are home to most of the philippine middle class the extent to which this sense of frustration and anxiety was national in scope is relatively less clear the duterte government s priorities and policies upon assuming office on june 30 2016 duterte assembled an eclectic cabinet that included law school classmates long time associates from davao ex military officers business leaders and representatives of the communist left his diverse coalition came together through personal loyalty regional affinity and political opportunism it included many political figures who had been sidelined during the aquino administration most notably former president gloria macapagal arroyo and members of the marcos estrada and villar families now seventy three years old duterte s world view is heavily influenced by nationalist and leftist thought dating from the 1960s and 1970s as well as by his twenty two years of experience as mayor of davao city in davao he combined a hardline approach to law and order with socially progressive and pro business policies as mayor he was both a paternalistic patron and a fearsome boss whose orders had to be followed as a result he has little tolerance for scrutiny or challenges to this authority he sees the country as beset by existential threats of drugs crime and corruption as befits philippine culture his approach is highly personalistic he presents himself as the only leader strong and decisive enough to save the nation as for his frequently crude and threatening rhetoric anthropologist nicole curato has called his approach crass politics that though objectionable to many communicates multiple messages duterte may be offending the norms of respectful communication when he prefaces his remarks with mother fucker but he brings to the surface the collective frustration many feel he may not offer the clearest policy but he puts forward the sincerest discourse of sympathy duterte s gutter language establishes the urgency of saving the republic including kill and death is essential to the president s vocabulary for the country is at war and his politics of i will demands quick albeit painful solutions 11 key concerns and priorities the duterte government s top priorities include combating illegal drugs and crime promoting rapid infrastructure development sustaining economic growth and making it more inclusive enhancing peace and development in mindanao and reorienting the philippines foreign relations to support these goals the government has significantly increased spending on infrastructure raised the salaries of government employees expanded existing social development programs revived the stalled peace process with the moro national liberation front mnlf and the moro islamic liberation front milf entered into negotiations with the communist insurgents and established a closer relationship with china space constraints do not permit a full discussion of the government s domestic and foreign policies instead the following sections discuss three policy areas that offer insights into the duterte administration economic policymaking peace and development in mindanao and constitutional change and discuss in greater detail the ongoing war on drugs economic policies and performance as a candidate duterte showed little interest in economic policy issues to reassure nervous domestic and foreign businesses his campaign developed a ten point economic agenda that largely continued the aquino government s economic policies since taking office duterte s two principal economic priorities have been to accelerate economic growth and make it more inclusive and to significantly increase spending on much needed infrastructure key features of the government s approach to the economy include running a larger deficit adopting a more statist approach to infrastructure development and continuing increases in social spending in 2017 gdp growth was 6 7 percent and it is projected to be about 6 5 percent in 2018 the government under its build build build program has significantly increased spending on infrastructure and has ambitious plans to build new rail lines a subway highways and bridges in the coming years 12 to finance spending on infrastructure and social services the government has embarked on a multiphase tax reform program the first package of reforms was signed into law in december 2017 the second and more controversial package is with congress inflation has been increasing averaging 4 8 percent for january to august and reaching a nine year high of 6 7 percent in september and october 13 higher oil and food prices excise taxes associated with tax reform and the weak peso have all fueled inflation duterte and mindanao duterte is the first president from the southern island of mindanao and his election was a significant political milestone for the philippines home to about 25 percent of the nation s population mindanao is a promising but vexing mix of economic opportunity and underdevelopment ethnic and religious diversity and multiple forms of armed conflict under duterte progress on the political and security front has been mixed this is in large measure due to the may 2017 occupation of marawi city in lanao del sur province by islamist extremists affiliated with the self proclaimed islamic state it took five months of combat operations for the philippine military to regain control over the extensively damaged city in response to the marawi crisis duterte imposed island wide martial law which remains in effect the rehabilitation of the city is expected to cost more than 1 billion but before marawi exploded the duterte government had done little either to revive the stalled effort to pass legislation providing for greater muslim autonomy or to adopt federalism an approach that many in mindanao consider important for the island s future the government had entered into a series of on again off again talks with the communist insurgency which still has a significant armed presence in eastern mindanao currently the process has stalled and appears unlikely to produce a breakthrough the most significant accomplishment pertaining to mindanao was the passage of the bangsamoro organic law bol in july 2018 the bol translates into law many of the provisions included in the 2014 peace agreement between the aquino government and the milf under the bol a new political entity the bangsamoro autonomous region in muslim mindanao would replace the current autonomous region in muslim mindanao the bol is an important step forward but multiple challenges remain including possible objections to its constitutionality a forthcoming plebiscite scheduled for late january and early february 2019 and the actual establishment of the new autonomous entity the fading prospects for constitutional change as a candidate duterte ran against the widely perceived political and economic dominance of imperial manila and promised to change the philippines into a federal state this platform was not unprecedented since 1992 there have been recurring initiatives for charter change or cha cha in the colloquial expression and all of them have failed duterte s popularity and political dominance seemed to enhance the prospects for success this time but during most of his first two years in office he showed limited interest in this complex and contentious issue of federalism he appointed a twenty two member constitutional commission and received its proposed draft constitution in early july 2018 the commission suggested eighteen federated regions and kept the directly elected presidency cha cha is now in the hands of the congress if both houses agree to change the constitution the revised charter will be subject to a national plebiscite over the past year opposition to both the substance and process of cha cha has grown senators are elected in a nationwide constituency so many of them see federalism as a threat to their political influence and ambitions others criticize the process for being tightly controlled and nonparticipatory several of duterte s own economic managers have raised concerns about the economic costs and uncertainties that would accompany such a fundamental change a recent pulse asia survey indicated that most filipinos have little knowledge of the 1987 constitution and 66 percent are against changing it the same survey also found that 69 percent have little or no knowledge of federalism and only 28 percent favored changing to a federal system 14 as of december 2018 it appears unlikely that cha cha will happen before the may 2019 midterm elections the outcome of these elections and particularly the future composition of the senate may determine whether cha cha will be revived in the next legislative term the war on drugs and its consequences for politics and governance duterte s principal priority has been a highly punitive approach to illegal drug use which he sees as an existential threat to the country s social fabric his nationwide war on drugs has applied the approach that he used in davao city giving the police free rein to deal with suspected drug users and pushers with little concern for legal niceties it also has involved a lesser noticed campaign against government officials allegedly complicit in the drug trade this approach has resulted in the deaths of thousands of suspected drug users and pushers mostly young males living in poor urban neighborhoods at the hands of the police or unidentified assailants the police claim that many of these deaths were the result of the suspects resisting arrest but evidence from journalists and human rights groups shows that many were premeditated extra judicial killings ejks 15 the number of ejks is difficult to determine and disputed in part because the government and philippine national police pnp intentionally obfuscate the data but estimates range from 6 000 to 12 000 deaths 16 this loss of life is the most horrific and immediate consequence of the drug war but the drug war itself is a sign that the philippine government has abdicated its responsibility to protect human rights and respect the rule of law ejks violate both the philippine constitution and the international covenant on civil and political rights to which the philippines is a signatory particularly the provisions concerning the presumption of innocence and adherence to due process given the attention that human rights organizations and the media have paid to the drug war it is worth looking more closely at the reasons for it and some of its broader consequences 17 why is duterte singularly focused on drugs and crime it is not surprising that crime is a major problem in the philippines given its high level of poverty underresourced and corruption prone law enforcement agencies and glacially slow judiciary criminal activities in the form of smuggling illegal gambling drugs trafficking in persons and money laundering are significant features of the philippine political economy 18 studies by international alert suggest that the illicit economy in mindanao plays an important role in sustaining the multiple conflicts across the island 19 crime has been a political issue intermittently since the 1960s marcos pointed to criminality and lawlessness as a justification for martial law in 1972 and joseph estrada s image as a crime fighter was an important aspect of his political appeal in the late 1990s 20 crime also corrupts politics and undermines institutions politicians and the police have long participated in protected or otherwise benefited from criminal activity the proceeds from these illegal activities have been an important source of financing for some politicians as well as for terrorist groups at the community level drug use and drug related crimes have long been recognized as serious social problems by the late 1990s the importation primarily from china local production and use of methamphetamine hydrochloride known as shabu in the philippines was a major issue for law enforcement and the courts 21 in public opinion surveys prior to 2016 crime usually came just behind unemployment and food prices in the list of people s main concerns survey data also showed a complex trend during the aquino administration fewer people were victims of crime but more were worried about encountering drug addicts under duterte the official estimates of drug use have increased significantly suggesting that they were either understated before or are being overstated now 22 since the early 2000s there has been a growing awareness of the problem of narco politics mostly involving mayors and other local officials thought to be complicit in the drug trade 23 however it would be an exaggeration to assert that the philippines is becoming a narco state where state institutions have been penetrated by the power and wealth of drug lords and the economy depends heavily on the production or distribution of illegal drugs nevertheless duterte sees it differently although he was not the first presidential candidate to run against drugs and crime he was the first to frame drugs as an existential threat and to be explicit about the brutal approach he would use to solve the problem why has duterte made illegal drugs his signature issue in addition to viewing drugs as a cancer on society there is an ugly political logic combating drugs and crime was central to his reputation as an effective mayor of davao city moreover public acceptance of the davao death squad a shadowy group that specifically targeted suspected drug dealers petty criminals and homeless youth showed the low cost and high returns of mounting an extra legal war on drugs and crime 24 as president duterte s nationwide war on drugs continues to play well across most socioeconomic segments of society particularly as long as the principal victims are the urban poor the drug war also offers a potent and useful political narrative in which duterte alone possesses the moral authority to rescue the country from the dangers posed by drug pushers and other criminals as peter kreuzer a german researcher has observed duterte not only successfully established crime as the most pressing problem but also made the unconditional fight against this threat into a hallmark of a comprehensive we group given the assumed absoluteness of the evil to be combated any criticism of the president has been silenced detractors are suspected of being supporters of the criminal threat to society and any reference to due process can be ignored 25 this narrative of drugs as an existential threat has been used to justify imprisoning opposition senator leila de lima a prominent critic of duterte s drug war to exercise control over local officials and to frame the motivation of the islamic extremists who took over marawi city26 public attitudes about the war on drugs most filipinos believe that duterte s war on alleged drug users and pushers is a draconian but necessary response to a serious social problem survey data have shown strong but softening support for it in december 2016 85 percent of those surveyed voiced satisfaction though by june 2018 only 78 percent were satisfied 27 at the same time almost three out of four filipinos 73 percent believe that ejks happen almost as many are concerned that they might be a victim of an ejk and a large majority think that it is important for the police to capture suspects alive 28 why is there such strong public support for the drug war one explanation offered is that it reflects widespread disillusionment with the philippine justice system certainly rich and powerful filipinos enjoy near total impunity while many poor and middle class filipinos see the system s high costs delays partiality and corruption however the degree of alienation should not be overstated few filipinos ever go to court and surveys indicate that the judiciary and the police both enjoy moderately high approval ratings a second explanation is that duterte has successfully dehumanized suspected drug pushers and users and turned them into a threatening other to be eradicated by any means available as such they do not deserve legal protections rehabilitation or empathy this view might erode if the war on drugs expanded to target alleged drug users in the middle and upper classes a third explanation is that the drug war despite its excesses is seen as a welcome example of government responsiveness it is rare for multiple government authorities including the pnp national government agencies and local government officials to work together to address pressing social issues this whole of government approach appears to have produced results according to the pnp the national crime rate excluding murders has declined more than 20 percent over the past two years and surveys suggest that filipinos feel more secure in a june 2018 pulse asia survey 69 percent said that the duterte administration s efforts to eradicate the drugs is his most important accomplishment with the fight against criminality ranking second 29 the drug war s impact on the philippine national police the pnp is the government institution most deeply involved in implementing the drug war known locally as oplan double barrel or oplan tokhang and therefore most directly affected by it 30 the involvement of pnp elements in ejks is well documented and beyond dispute 31 some broader consequences of the pnp s involvement are worth examining in greater detail although largely overlooked by most analyses the pnp and its predecessor the philippine constabulary have long been at the nexus of politics crime and the rule of law as historian alfred mccoy has shown philippine presidents and local officials have used the police as an essential tool to assert their authority bolster their legitimacy selectively fight crime and control dissent 32 as the principal law enforcement agency the pnp has a long history of being vulnerable to corruption particularly in the highly lucrative areas of illegal gambling drugs and smuggling some of this corruption stems from individual greed but it also is the product of low salaries the complicity of politicians and the multifaceted shortcomings of the justice system as mayor of a city that at times was wracked by political and criminal violence duterte considered the police to be a central pillar of his government he established close relationships with many in the police and gained an intimate understanding of how the police operate thus it is not surprising that duterte and the pnp have a symbiotic relationship in the context of duterte s drug war individual police officers face difficult choices journalist sheila coronel describes the complex considerations that influence police behavior today policemen weigh the continually shifting balance of incentives and risks as they seek to deter crime advance their careers please their political patrons and make money while also evading exposure and prosecution yet in the end these policemen often also believe they are upholding order and helping keep the peace they are specialists in violence practitioners in the skills of lethal force who improvise often morally and legally questionable workarounds to the constraints of a broken justice system 33 the longer term consequences for law enforcement from the war on drugs may be highly damaging the brookings institution s vanda felbab brown has warned about its potentially corrupting influence inducing police to engage in de facto shoot to kill policies is enormously corrosive of law enforcement not to mention the rule of law there is a high chance that the policy will more than ever institutionalize top level corruption as only powerful drug traffickers will be able to bribe their way into upper levels of the philippine law enforcement system moreover corrupt top level cops and government officials tasked with such witch hunts will have the perfect opportunity to direct law enforcement against their drug business rivals as well as political enemies and themselves become the top drug capos 34 moreover assuming that eventually there will be a president who no longer sanctions ejks by the police the seeds have been planted for a potentially divisive and dangerous debate over how to handle human rights abuses that the pnp carried out during the duterte era other collateral damage duterte s war on drugs has had less dramatic but significant consequences for other aspects of governance in the philippines including the justice system public health and local governance impact on the justice system the war on drugs has further stressed the philippines overburdened justice system the volume of cases to be investigated prosecuted and tried as well as the number of alleged offenders awaiting trial in detention facilities has increased dramatically a comprehensive picture of the impact on the justice system is beyond the scope of this working paper but some of the available data point to these burdens in 2016 there were 28 000 drug arrests a 44 percent increase over 2015 and more than 47 300 drug related cases were filed 35 during the first 10 months of 2017 the philippine drug enforcement agency conducted 34 744 drug enforcement operations with 66 672 arrests 36 in 2017 about 70 700 drug related cases were filed in court and about 21 400 were reviewed 37 according to the supreme court as of 2017 more than 289 000 drug cases had been filed in the country s lower courts 38 as a result drug suspects and convicts are crammed into the philippines already packed jails and prisons according to the department of justice s bureau of corrections in 2017 the national prison system held 41 500 inmates more than double its capacity data from the bureau of jail management and penology which oversees provincial and municipal jails show an even more disturbing situation as of may 2018 there were over 141 000 detainees of which about 70 percent were drug related cases held in jails that were 582 percent overcapacity 39 ultimately the legal dimensions of the war on drugs will test not only the capacity of the justice system but also the jurisprudence values and autonomy of the philippine judiciary in november 2018 a regional trial court issued the first legal judgment against the pnp finding three policemen guilty of murdering kian delos santos a seventeen year old the policemen claimed was a drug runner who resisted arrest currently there is one case before the supreme court challenging the constitutionality of the pnp s official plan for eradicating illegal drugs impact on public health the government s punitive approach to reducing drug use also has important consequences for public health it has overwhelmed the country s paltry rehabilitation capacity and is having a negative effect on drug linked diseases as of mid 2017 the philippines had only forty eight drug rehabilitation facilities and only about fifty medical personnel trained in addiction medicine 40 according to the philippine drug enforcement agency close to 990 000 drug personalities voluntarily surrendered in 2016 and by may 2017 that number had grown to 1 2 million people the war on drugs has had predictable negative effects on drug related public health problems according to vanda felbab brown crucial goal of drug policy should be to enhance public health and limit the spread of diseases linked to drug use the worst possible policy is to push addicts into the shadows ostracize them and increase the chance of overdoses as well as a rapid spread of hiv aids drug resistant tuberculosis and hepatitis in prisons users will not get adequate treatment for either their addiction or their communicable disease even prior to the duterte s brutal war on drugs the rate of hiv infections in the philippines has been soaring due to inadequate awareness and failure to support safe sex practices duterte s war on drugs will only intensify these worrisome trends among drug users 41 impact on local politics and government duterte s almost singular focus on the drug war has far reaching consequences for the country s local politics and governance in many respects subnational government in the philippines is highly decentralized but most local government units lgus are dependent upon central government funding and grapple with the challenge of unfunded mandates lgus are key actors in the drug war and local officials need to juggle multiple and sometimes conflicting priorities including protecting their citizens cooperating with local law enforcement and demonstrating results to central authorities and as reported by rappler a respected philippine news website the drug war has caused a major shift in lgu priorities at the local level the drug war has changed the way barangays spend their funds traditional social services such as medical clinics or feeding programs for malnourished children are no longer budget priorities through a number of policy incentives as well as strict supervision by the dilg the priority at the barangay level has now become the monitoring and surveillance of drug suspects and the rehabilitation of drug users who have surrendered 42 there also is a darker dimension to the drug war at the local level peter kreuzer notes the pressure and intimidation experienced by local officials it has become highly problematic for local political elites to evade the president s injunction to participate in the anti crime killing spree that is engulfing the philippines the various reshuffles are placing more hard line police officers in command positions furthermore these officers are well aware that results measured in dead bodies are expected of them in addition police officers and politicians alike have been publicly denounced as supporting and profiting from drug crimes and thus threatened not only with being indicted but also with becoming victims of extrajudicial executions themselves most officials then choose to fall in line with the president 43 duterte s subversion of democratic institutions and norms the duterte government s approach to eradicating illegal drugs besides being inhumane and misguided has negative consequences for the rule of law governance and politics but that is not the full extent of the damage being done to the philippine polity this section provides an assessment of the duterte government s impact on democratic institutions and norms just hardball politics as usual some observers of philippine politics might argue that duterte is only the most recent example of presidents who exercise fully the levers of executive power to advance their political and policy agendas in this light he is perpetuating and perhaps perfecting the hardball politics that every president has practiced since 1986 to be sure duterte s predecessors all used a mix of persuasion and inducements to advance their agenda and no president has been above using intimidation and subterfuge to get their way at times therefore the politics as usual view has some superficial validity but a deeper assessment shows that the duterte presidency is qualitatively different from its post marcos predecessors because of its willingness to intimidate the opposition weaken institutional checks and discard democratic norms the duterte presidency is fundamentally different from post 1986 administrations in its unrelenting use of intimidation to weaken any challenges to its authority duterte s brutal drug war sends a powerful message regarding his willingness to use extra legal means including ejks to achieve his goals unlike previous administrations duterte and his supporters routinely use lawsuits incarceration and social media trolling to intimidate opponents and critics as sociologist randy david has observed compared to ferdinand marcos mr duterte has performed the art of intimidation with consummate skill without warning he calls out the name of his prey denouncing him or her in the strongest possible terms and publicly announces that he or she or they are in his line of fire the public has learned to take these instances of public vilification of targeted figures as part of the duterte style of rule people know these are not empty threats indeed the public takes them as synonymous with the president s exercise of political will 44 in some cases duterte s threats may simply reflect his impetuous personality and desire to dominate media coverage however his statements and actions also send the message that no one is safe from his attacks and that opposing him is a high risk venture disabling democratic checks and balances as a former mayor duterte is used to governing by decree and by dint of his personality popularity and unrivaled authority in davao city he had no strong political opposition significant institutional checks or close media scrutiny peter kreuzer writing in 2009 when duterte was mayor presciently observed duterte makes abundantly clear that there can be security but only he himself can provide it security is provided according to his personal ideas of justice and adequateness in his political symbolism duterte clearly is above the law it is him who indicts passes judgment and orders the executioners to do their job it is a personalized fight between those who do not follow the rules and the rightful vigilante whose rules reign supreme 45 as president duterte has repeatedly expressed his disdain for those who oppose his policies and has taken numerous steps to silence his critics and weaken institutional checks led by solicitor general jose calida the government has weaponized the legal system to attack political opponents this began in early 2017 when opposition senator leila de lima was imprisoned on nonbailable drug related charges 46 groups allied with duterte as well as some leftist organizations have filed multiple lawsuits against former president aquino and former budget secretary florencio butch abad a longtime leader of the liberal party most recently in september 2018 the government arrested senator antonio trillanes iv a vocal critic of duterte the government claimed that a presidential pardon granted to trillanes by benigno aquino in 2011 was invalid therefore making trillanes ineligible to serve as senator 47 groups allied with duterte as well as some leftist organizations have filed multiple

trillanes iv a vocal critic of duterte the government claimed that a presidential pardon granted to trillanes by benigno aquino in 2011 was invalid therefore making trillanes ineligible to serve as senator duterte has repeatedly disparaged or threatened the leaders of key accountability institutions like the chairman of the commission on human rights the chief justice of the supreme court and the chairwoman of the office of the ombudsman followers of duterte threatened to seek the impeachment of ombudsman conchita carpio morales but her term ended in july 2018 most disturbingly in march 2018 solicitor general calida filed a quo warranto petition against then chief justice maria lourdes sereno and in may 2018 the supreme court which currently is dominated by macapagal arroyo appointees and in time will be dominated by duterte appointees took the unprecedented and arguably unconstitutional step of removing its own chief justice 48 the government has threatened the mainstream media with lawsuits and nonrenewal of franchises 49 these threats have been directed at media owners like the rufino prieto family which owns the philippine daily inquirer and the lopez family which owns abs cbn the country s largest tv network in january 2018 the securities and exchange commission revoked the operating license of the highly respected news website rappler alleging that it has foreign owners and therefore is in violation of the constitution in november the department of justice said that it had grounds to indict both rappler and its founder maria ressa for tax evasion and failure to file tax returns 50 meanwhile on social media critics of the government are routinely harassed and threatened these threats have been directed at media owners like the rufino prieto family which owns the philippine daily inquirer and the lopez family which owns abs cbn the country s largest tv network in january 2018 the securities and exchange commission revoked the

had grounds to indict both rappler and its founder maria ressa for tax evasion and failure to file tax returns meanwhile on social media critics of the government are routinely harassed and threatened finally duterte has periodically raised the specter of declaring martial law nationwide or forming a revolutionary government that would no longer be bound by the constitution declaring martial law would be constitutional at least initially but would be extremely polarizing politically however declaring a revolutionary government would be an extra constitutional act it seems likely that these statements are intended as trial balloons to gauge public and elite reactions the prospects for pushback political and institutional checks on duterte president duterte s continued popularity is not surprising his base of support is rooted in his persona his tough approach to fighting drugs and crime his proto populist policies and the philippines continuing economic growth moreover duterte and his supporters have demonstrated an impressive ability to put their opponents on the defensive they portray individuals and groups associated with the aquino administration as incompetent or corrupt elitists they accuse defenders of human rights of protecting drug peddlers and criminals they charge the mainstream media with being partisan and disseminating fake news what then are the existing and potential checks on duterte countervailing institutions and actors a brief scan of the political landscape suggests that most institutions and actors that can serve as checks on duterte are weak divided or under attack provisions in the 1987 constitution place checks on the duration of martial law and the powers than can be exercised under it today the powers granted to the president and the military during martial law are limited in ways that did not exist when ferdinand marcos used martial law as the foundation for his dictatorship however it is still possible that the constitution will be rewritten which could include expanding the scope for declaring martial law and increasing the powers exercised under it since 1986 the jurisprudence of the fifteen member supreme court has been eclectic defying simple characterization based on its decisions over the past two years it is clear that the court does not see itself as a bulwark against duterte s exercise of presidential power moreover the court s autonomy and integrity have been seriously compromised by the unprecedented removal of sereno from chief justice at the behest of duterte s solicitor general has been eclectic defying simple characterization based on its decisions over the past two years it is clear that the court does not see itself as a bulwark against duterte s exercise of presidential power moreover the court s autonomy and integrity have been seriously compromised by the unprecedented removal of sereno from chief justice at the behest of duterte s solicitor general the commission on human rights has limited authority and a small staff and budget without the cooperation of the pnp and government prosecutors its impact has been further diminished the dramatic increase in ejks has highlighted the relative powerlessness of the commission as well as the divisions and weaknesses that characterize human rights ngos in the philippines the mainstream political opposition is weak and on the defensive this is the predictable consequence of the power of the presidency duterte s popularity and the chronic weakness of political parties the liberal party has been decimated by defections and its leadership and other members of the aquino coalition have struggled to craft a counternarrative and strategy aquino has been largely silent and until recently the putative leader of the opposition vice president leonor leni robredo has kept an intentionally low profile the national democratic left has been divided by duterte s policies since 1986 the natdem left the legal political parties and mass organizations associated with the communist party of the philippines cpp has enjoyed a relatively small but well organized following but it also suffers from factionalism and antiquated leadership and doctrine its unity has been weakened by the contradictions inherent in duterte s policies to woo over this section of the opposition duterte invited members of the left into his cabinet entered into peace talks with the cpp and its armed wing new people s army npa and has been vociferously anti american at the same time other policies of his are anathema to the left the human rights abuses associated with the drug war his empowering of the pnp and the armed forces his threats to declare martial law and his decision to break off peace talks as a result the left has been slow to unify in opposition to duterte the catholic church is an influential voice in philippine society and politics but it is not monolithic and its views do not always prevail initially catholic bishops were divided over duterte and how to engage him especially because of his popularity and the public s support for the drug war but over time their cautious response to ejks has become more critical 51 duterte has openly disparaged the church calling it corrupt and hypocritical and at one point ranted about god being stupid duterte has openly disparaged the church calling it corrupt and hypocritical and at one point ranted about god being stupid civil society organizations csos and coalitions in the philippines can play an important political role through their policy advocacy efforts to make government more transparent and accountable and ability to mobilize protests however the political impact of civil society is reduced by partisan and ideological differences the narrow focus of most csos and inadequate financial and human resources many of the csos that worked closely with the aquino government are now suspect and on the defensive yet major universities especially those in manila remain important centers for critical analysis and debate philippine and foreign businesses were reassured by the duterte government s ten point economic plan which promised considerable continuity as well as the appointment of davao based businessman carlos sonny dominguez as finance secretary most businesses support the increased government spending on infrastructure but reactions to duterte s tax reforms have been more mixed businesses also have differing views on china s growing economic role and the desirability of federalism given the power of the presidency the business community tends to be reluctant to criticize a sitting president however this could change if businesses feel that they are being hurt by poor macroeconomic management or excessive cronyism or corruption it is important to note that there is a typical arc of presidencies which begins with high approval ratings strong congressional support and minimal opposition following the midterm elections the power of the president often begins to diminish as political and business elites position themselves for the next presidential election the potentially pivotal role of the armed forces the senior leadership of the armed forces of the philippines afp has a tradition of generally respecting civilian primacy but the afp nonetheless influences politics and policymaking in a variety of important ways first if there is a leadership crisis like there was in january 2001 following the aborted impeachment trial of then president joseph estrada and the afp chooses to withdraw its support from the sitting president it virtually guarantees the end of that presidency second the afp s longtime efforts to combat domestic armed insurgencies make it an influential actor in mindanao and other conflict affected areas under duterte the role of the afp in mindanao has been elevated further with the imposition of island wide martial law third the afp has a strong say in determining national security policy over the past decade the focus of the afp s mission has shifted from internal security to a growing concern with external threats particularly from china finally because of the afp s long standing ties to the u s military the afp is an important stakeholder in the philippines bilateral relationship with the united states in recent years the afp appears to have become more professional and less political but all presidents still cultivate the support of the afp leadership duterte has appointed numerous former officers to senior civilian positions in his government he knows a number of them from when he was mayor and he appears to believe that military officers will be more effective administrators and less prone to corruption than civilians he also wants to bolster support within the military for his national security policies including negotiating with the communists and embracing china he has courted rank and file soldiers and police visiting many military bases and raising salaries to date secretary of defense delfin lorenzana and the afp leadership have shown they understand the constitutionally mandated role of the military and are committed to military professionalism the afp has avoided being drawn into the antidrug campaign and to date the army appears to have administered martial law in mindanao with competence and restraint however given mandatory retirement ages the senior leadership of the afp changes fairly rapidly therefore routine leadership changes could bring to the fore senior officers who are more political a final potentially important issue is the uncertain extent to which members of the afp agree with the duterte administration s approach to addressing the country s national security challenges some members of the military may likely object to his pivot to china his willingness to negotiate with communist insurgents and his fixation on the drug war other military officials may also feel that the afp s domestic role has become unacceptably overextended by the marawi crisis in 2017 the administration of martial law across mindanao and the continuing threat of islamist extremism the importance of public opinion public opinion in the philippines is frequently measured by credible survey firms and closely monitored by all politicians as a result public support for the president is an important factor in perceptions of presidential power duterte has remained popular because he entered office with an energized base of support and because elements of his persona and policies appeal across socioeconomic classes what might cause public support for duterte to soften duterte promised real change within a matter of months although most filipinos probably knew that his timeframe was unrealistic he is now well into the third year of his administration and there has been little or no change on many fronts the economy continues to grow but the benefits of growth have not been quickly or widely shared likewise it will be years before the benefits of the government s infrastructure program will be widely experienced 52 meanwhile the push for federalism has been erratic and appears to have stalled scholar nicole curato suggests that support for duterte is conditional not fanatical according to her he may be able to get away with murders but not with broken promises 53 meanwhile the push for federalism has been erratic and appears to have stalled scholar nicole curato suggests that support for duterte is conditional not fanatical according to her he may be able to get away with murders but not with broken promises deteriorating economic conditions the philippine economy is likely to continue to grow at around 6 5 percent for the foreseeable future but as has been the case in the past strong gdp growth does not necessarily result in rapid improvements in the incomes of poor filipinos instead inflation which currently is at a nine year high has an immediate and tangible impact on consumers especially the poor and retirees in addition to the spike in inflation the depreciation of the peso and the uncertainties associated with a change to a federal system pose risks to the economy s performance corruption begins to undermine duterte s moral authority every presidency is tainted by corruption to a greater or lesser degree there is little evidence that duterte enriched himself while he was mayor of davao city and as president he has dismissed though not necessarily punished members of his administration suspected of corruption but his push to rapidly increase spending on infrastructure combined with the weakening of accountability mechanisms almost guarantees more corruption and malfeasance in government as joel rocamora has observed people turned against erap not because of his performance as president but because they changed their judgment of the man judgment shifted from the rational to the moral sphere 54 unease with becoming another province of china the rapidity degree and tone of duterte s embrace of china and commensurate distancing from the united states are not without political risks many filipinos have some chinese blood so there is not the same level of sensitivity about ethnic chinese domination of the economy as is found in indonesia and malaysia however some filipinos have less than positive views of chinese nationals residing in the philippines because they are seen as being associated with the drug trade gambling and illegal mining 55 surveys indicate that filipinos have a high level of trust in the united states and a low level of trust in china and four of five filipinos believe that it is not right to accede to china in the south china sea 56 surveys indicate that filipinos have a high level of trust in the united states and a low level of trust in china and four of five filipinos believe that it is not right to accede to china in the south china sea the emergence of an appealing alternative to date the opposition to duterte lacks a leader or group of leaders who offers a compelling alternative to the president and his policies the government s targeted assault on opposition leaders including the arrests of senators de lima and trillanes is partly to blame but the opposition s weakness also stems from its limited pool of potential leaders after maintaining a low profile for most of the past two years vice president leni robredo has become more vocal in her criticisms besides vice president robredo other potential challengers include those whom duterte has attacked senators de lima and trillanes and former chief justice sereno moreover former president gloria macapagal arroyo who was elevated to speaker of the house in july 2018 also may be positioning herself as a possible successor to duterte is duterte a populist and does it matter in recent years populist has become a convenient adjective to describe a growing number of political leaders including duterte but as a term intended to categorize a particular approach to politics and governing populism is frustratingly expansive cas mudde and cristobal rovira kaltwasser describe populism as a thin centered ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into two homogeneous and antagonist camps the pure people versus the corrupt elite 57 to this can be added jan werner muller s observation that in addition to being anti elitist populists are always anti pluralist when running for office populists portray their political competitors as part of the immoral corrupt elite when ruling they refuse to recognize any opposition as legitimate muller also notes that populists in power tend to frame their rule as a response to a crisis or an existential threat 58 finally steven levitsky and james loxton point to two additional traits of populist leaders they claim to be political outsiders and they establish a personalistic linkage to voters 59 using these criteria duterte certainly has some populist traits his mindanaowan roots crass language and brusque behavior set him apart from most of the national political elite in his campaign he ran as a manila outsider and portrayed the members of the elite associated with the aquino government as incompetent and corrupt as president he has framed the problems of drugs and crime as an existential national crisis and portrayed drug users as a dehumanized other his efforts to intimidate political opponents and critics clearly are anti pluralist however other aspects of duterte s politics do not comport with populism although he portrays himself as a political outsider he is from a prominent political family and served as mayor of a major city for twenty two years even as he criticizes some members of the political and business elite in practice he has allied himself with powerful members of the political establishment most notably gloria macapagal arroyo and the marcos estrada and villar families and while duterte is more antagonistic toward powerful taipans and conglomerates than benigno aquino was he appears more interested in ensuring that they support him than in reducing the concentration of economic power duterte has increased spending for social programs and some of the government s policies such as higher salaries for government employees free irrigation and tertiary public education can be viewed as populist but to date his core fiscal and macroeconomic policies are more neoliberal than populist however if duterte s popularity declines there is a risk that his government will adopt economic policies that are more statist and populist finally to date duterte has not created a mass movement or highly personalistic political party typically associated with populist leaders according to joel rocamora digong may bring the popular medjo bastos rudeness into political discourse but he does not bring citizens into formal processes of political participation in contrast to populists who mobilize people digong like estrada is a demobilising populist 60 reflecting this perspective as well as the more general challenge of building political organizations in the philippines efforts to create a pro duterte grassroots movement kilusang pagbabago movement for change appear to have faltered in its stead duterte s daughter sara duterte carpio has established hugpong ng pagbabago faction for change a mindanao based political party widely viewed as her vehicle for entering national politics the putative failure of the former and the creation of the latter demonstrate the continued dominance of traditional dynastic politics in sum describing duterte as a populist provides a convenient but not entirely accurate label to characterize a complex somewhat contradictory politician with a disparate policy agenda still the growing literature on populist leaders generally depicts them as being toxic to liberal democracy so the duterte as populist narrative provides a valid but limited frame for viewing his impact on democracy democratic backsliding how far how fast with the challenges currently facing liberal democracy in the united states and elsewhere the concept of democratic backsliding has taken on new saliency according to nancy bermeo backsliding in its broadest sense is state led debilitation or elimination of any of the political institutions that sustain existing democracy emphasis added 61 a 2015 study on democratic backsliding written by ellen lust and david waldner for the u s agency for international development usaid suggests that backsliding is best conceived as a change in a combination of competitive electoral procedures civil and political liberties and accountability and that backsliding occurs through a series of discrete changes in the rules and informal procedures that shape those elections rights and accountability these discrete changes take place over time separated by months or even years and the end result is not predetermined backsliding may result in democratic breakdown or it may not and can occur within both democratic and authoritarian regimes 62 the term backsliding is particularly appropriate for low quality democracies like the philippines where concerted and sustained efforts are required to improve the quality of democracy absent that backsliding is inevitable how serious is the problem of democratic backsliding in the philippines and is the country on the way to democratic breakdown in answering these questions it is important to start by recognizing the sources of democratic resiliency in the philippines democratic resiliencies elite democracy was practiced before martial law was declared in 1972 and after the restoration of democracy in 1986 it often was not pretty and it failed in a number of important ways but many filipinos take pride in people power and norms of constitutionalism political competition free speech and media and autonomous civil society have fairly deep roots a variety of influential institutions including the catholic church many schools and universities and most of the media embrace and promote democratic norms moreover the alternative to democracy authoritarianism is not an abstraction at least to older filipinos who experienced the marcos dictatorship broad support for democracy among filipinos has been consistently borne out in surveys a 2018 social weather stations sws survey showed that 78 percent were satisfied with how democracy works and 60 percent always preferred democracy 63 surveys also consistently show a high degree of satisfaction with the country s democratic institutions including the senate house of representatives and supreme court so while filipinos tend to be fairly cynical about the motivations and integrity of politicians and government officials they are used to enjoying political freedoms lively political debates and competitive elections vulnerabilities at the same time multiple conditions in the philippines make it vulnerable to democratic backsliding socioeconomic conditions inequality the uneven distribution of benefits from economic growth and an apparent sense of middle class insecurity and vulnerability may make the poor and middle class receptive to promises of simplistic quick fixes presidentialism and weak institutions the combination of a powerful presidency and generally weak and malleable political institutions gives the president wide latitude if a president does not respect democratic institutions and norms many other political actors will follow suit the weakness of collective action this applies particularly to political parties and civil society organizations in how democracies die steven levitsky and daniel ziblatt underscore the important role that political parties historically have played in containing extremist demagogues but in the philippines parties are abysmally weak and to date have been unable to provide compelling alternative leaders or narratives although the philippines boasts a robust civil society as of yet it has not been an effective counterforce to duterte generational change most filipinos under the age of forty five did not directly experience either the abuses of the marcos era or the nonviolent people power revolution that forced him from office in 1986 moreover because school curricula have glossed over the period and the younger members of the marcos family particularly his children have been able to revamp his image public understanding of the severe damage done by the marcos dictatorship has been diminished 64 as a result younger filipinos know only the freedoms and disappointments of thirty years of elite democracy this may make them less protective of the democratic freedoms that were lost during the marcos era death by a thousand cuts in how democracies die levitsky and ziblatt describe the incremental demise of democracy many government efforts to subvert democracy are legal in the sense that they are approved by the legislature or accepted by the courts because there is no single moment no coup declaration of martial law or suspension of the constitution in which the regime obviously crosses the line into dictatorship nothing may set off society s alarm bells those who denounce government abuse may be dismissed as exaggerating or crying wolf democracy s erosion is for many almost imperceptible 65 this observation is highly relevant for the philippines under duterte two and a half years into his presidency with the very important exception of ejks his government still operates largely within the bounds of the constitution he has not muzzled the media outlawed the political opposition or canceled elections despite his threats he has not declared nationwide martial law or created a revolutionary government nevertheless the extent to which he has used the powers of the presidency to run roughshod over human rights and weaken democratic checks and balances is unprecedented levitsky and ziblatt also observe that without robust norms constitutional checks and balances do not serve as the bulwarks of democracy we imagine them to be in particular they point to the importance of two norms 1 mutual toleration the understanding that competing parties accept one another as legitimate rivals and 2 forbearance the idea that politicians should exercise restraint in deploying their institutional prerogatives 66 duterte s actions clearly violate both of these norms to be sure they have been frequently disregarded in the past but under duterte any pretense of honoring them has disappeared as lisandro claudio and patricio abinales have noted duterte is the first philippine president to not render even the minimum obeisance to liberal democratic politics 67 bermeo points to the challenge of responding to gradual or incremental backsliding slow slides toward authoritarianism often lack both the bright spark that ignites an effective call to action and the opposition and movement leaders who can voice that clarion to date duterte hasn t triggered the bright spark and the opposition to him has yet to generate compelling new leaders or political movements but even where there is backsliding there may be grounds for optimism that it can be reversed as bermeo notes incremental and ambiguous change preserves mixed landscapes wherein one set of institutions or ideas can correct others as long as some electoral competition takes place power can be clawed back when civil society is allowed some space countermobilization can occur because backsliding reflects incentive structures changed incentives can reverse negative trends 68 the election driven overthrow of ferdinand marcos in 1986 as well as the electoral defeats of then president mahinda rajapaksa in sri lanka in january 2015 and then prime minister najib razak in malaysia in june 2018 give at least some credence to bormeo s cautious hopefulness summing up a mixed record delivering change and an uncertain future thus far how much real change has duterte s presidency produced and what does this suggest for the future to date there has been real change in several areas the first is the drug war and the damage it has inflicted on the rule of law the professionalism of the pnp and other aspects of governance second is the weakening of democratic institutions and norms third is a portion of the government s economic policies particularly the increase in spending on infrastructure and a few populist social programs fourth is the reorientation of the philippines foreign relations to move closer to china and pullback from the united states the united nations and the liberal norms espoused by the international community finally the possibility of constitutional changes up to and including federalism would be highly significant for the philippines alongside these changes there are important elements of continuity so far there is considerable continuity in most macroeconomic policies and public financial management the government also has continued to expand with some tweaks or rebranding most preexisting social development programs finally the passage of the bangsamoro organic law was the culmination of a decades long process under duterte there also are worrying signs of regression back to some of the worst aspects of traditional philippine politics first is the emphasis on highly personalistic leadership duterte s presidency is all about him and not about institutions second little effort has been made to reduce the entrenched power of political dynasties and oligarchs except those that might challenge duterte instead duterte has been willing to ally with traditional political leaders who have shown little interest in reforming politics and governance third his administration has adopted a somewhat more statist approach to economic development finally duterte s selective pandering to 1960s style anti u s nationalism which exaggerates the influence of the united states and sometimes is used to deflect public attention away from the shortcomings of far more important domestic actors is an unwelcome development looking ahead it seems likely that there will be a continuing struggle between elites and other groups who desire a strongman and those who believe in the desirability of democracy even the flawed version that has been practiced in the philippines the best case scenario is a gradual reassertion of checks and balances brought about by a softening of public support for duterte a growing recognition of the damage being done to philippine democracy and more unified and effective pushback against his antidemocratic actions but it is also possible that the country s contentious politics could move in dangerous directions this might be the case if duterte declares nationwide martial law or manages to ram through major changes to the 1987 constitution alternatively if duterte who is in poor health were to resign or be incapacitated before the end of his term members of his coalition might try to block vice president robredo from succeeding him under any of these scenarios there is a risk of mass mobilization both for and against duterte that could lead to extraconstitutional and potentially violent forms of people power this popular uprising in turn could tempt or compel the pnp and afp to take sides the philippines would then be in perilous uncharted territory american support for human rights and democracy in the philippines american diplomats often boast of the strong people to people connections that exist between the united states and the philippines principally because of the large filipino american community in the united states but america s institutional engagement with the philippines is surprisingly thin even though the country is a former colony a major treaty ally and a fellow democracy there are two reasons for this state of affairs first historically the bilateral relationship has been dominated by military security ties key elements of which include the 1951 mutual defense treaty the presence of two massive u s military bases in the philippines until the early 1990s the post 9 11 global war on terror and most recently the u s response to china s assertion of sovereignty in the south china sea second the philippines moderately sized economy has been less open to foreign investment and less export oriented than many other east asian economies as a result though u s philippines economic ties are not insignificant they are small compared to the united states relations with larger and more open economies in the region u s philippines relations less than meets the eye during the obama and aquino presidencies the bilateral relationship was the most cordial it had been since the fidel ramos administration 1992 1998 during the six month period following the election of duterte and before the election of donald trump the bilateral relationship went into a downward spiral the nadir came in early september 2016 prior to the association of south east asian nations asean summit in laos when it was reported that president obama would raise human rights issues in his one on one meeting with duterte in a news conference before the summit duterte angrily rejected being lectured by obama and famously said son of a whore i will curse you in that forum 69 in response obama canceled the meeting with duterte in september 2016 4 5 million in u s state department funding intended to assist philippine law enforcement was shifted to maritime security in november of the same year the state department suspended the sale of 26 000 military assault rifles to the pnp the arrival of a new u s ambassador sung kim in early december a month after trump s election provided an opportunity to reset the bilateral relationship today u s foreign policy is shaped by a president who expresses admiration for authoritarian rulers and has shown little interest in defending human rights and democracy the duterte administration is pro china much more transactional in its relationship with the united states and intolerant of any foreign criticism of human rights abuses associated with his drug war washington now finds itself with limited influence with regard to the duterte government unlike china and japan the u s government cannot compel american corporations to fund large infrastructure investments 70 moreover the philippines is not dependent on foreign aid so it can take or leave us development assistance this is exactly what it did in december 2017 when manila withdrew from being considered for a second millennium challenge corporation mcc compact worth over 400 million the philippines no longer met the mcc s minimum requirements in the areas of rule of law and controlling corruption so it withdrew in order to avoid the embarrassment of being turned down by the mcc board of directors the nongovernmental foundations of u s philippine relations are also surprisingly weak university to university ties are limited and only a few american universities offer philippine studies the involvement of american foundations even those that traditionally have had an interest in southeast asia such as the ford henry luce and open society foundations is minimal and in the realm of public diplomacy the passage of time has diminished the ranks and influence of champions of close u s philippines relations such as former senators john mccain and richard lugar former representative stephen solarz former secretary of state george shultz and former ambassadors stephen bosworth and nicholas platt all of whom have died or retired the timid american response to the duterte government s subversion of human rights and democracy since donald trump became president the u s government has avoided saying or doing anything that might alienate duterte during the first half of 2017 the scale and brutality of duterte s drug war became irrefutably clear in major reports by human rights watch and amnesty international as well as by powerful photojournalism by the philippine daily inquirer reuters and the new york times despite this in late april 2017 in a phone conversation with duterte trump told him i just wanted to congratulate you because i am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem many countries have the problem we have a problem but what a great job you are doing and i just wanted to call and tell you that 71 he also invited duterte to the white house an invitation duterte later declined when the state department was headed by rex tillerson and was itself in turmoil the u s government was largely silent regarding the drug war and human rights abuses in august 2017 when tillerson met with duterte at the asean summit in manila their discussion focused on the marawi crisis and terrorism and did not include the human rights violations associated with the drug war the state department s 2017 human rights report on the philippines acknowledged that extrajudicial killings have been the chief human rights concern in the country for many years and after a sharp rise with the onset of the antidrug campaign in 2016 they continued in 2017 concerns about police impunity increased significantly following the sharp increase in police killings however it seemed to suggest that the drug related ejks were not all that different from other human rights abuses in the philippines 72 in june 2018 the united states joined thirty seven other members out of forty seven total of the united nations human rights council to sign a statement on human rights in the philippines issued by the government of iceland we urge the government of the philippines to take all necessary measures to bring killings associated with the campaign against illegal drugs to an end and cooperate with the international community to investigate all related deaths and hold perpetrators accountable while acknowledging that drug use in the philippines is a serious problem actions to tackle drug abuse must be carried out in full respect of the rule of law and compliance with international human rights obligations 73 this statement appears to be the strongest public statement with which the u s government has been associated but it received little attention in the media on the same day this statement was issued the united states pulled out of the human rights council the u s congress expressed some initial concern over the situation in the philippines but has not taken any meaningful action in may 2017 senators ben cardin and marco rubio introduced a bill the philippines human rights accountability and counter narcotics act of 2017 s 1055 which would restrict arms sales to the pnp and provide up to 25 million in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 to support human rights groups and assist the philippines in dealing with its drug problem the bill was referred to the foreign relations committee and has languished there since in the house of representatives in july 2017 the tom lantos human rights commission held a hearing on the human rights consequences of the war on drugs in the philippines that was highly critical of duterte s war on drugs but there has been no subsequent action although the u s embassy in manila might be engaged in quiet diplomacy regarding human rights conversations with filipino human rights leaders suggest that little has taken place usaid s democracy human rights and governance drg portfolio in the philippines funds conventional rule of law civil society and local governance programs but stays well clear of anything that addresses democratic backsliding because of their dependency on usaid and state department funding democracy promotion organizations like freedom house the national democratic institute and the international republican institute have not responded in a major way the asia foundation in the philippines which relies more on australian than u s funding does some work on the rule of law but also shies away from anything that might antagonize the duterte government only the national endowment for democracy has significantly increased its funding in support of democracy in the philippines from under 500 000 in 2015 to over 1 million in 2017 the case for a more robust american response nancy bermeo has observed when backsliding yields situations that are fluid and ill defined taking action to defend democracy becomes particularly difficult 74 this is true for small d democrats both inside the philippines and abroad given the long standing dominance of u s military and security interests and the trump administration s lack of interest in defending democracy it is especially difficult for the u s government to formulate a suitable response still the united states has a unique historical relationship with the philippines one that needs to be considered alongside purely strategic considerations the philippines political system is modeled after america s and for more than a century the philippine elite s attitudes and behavior have been shaped by america s influence on the country s educational system economy and politics the u s government has long and influential relations with the afp and to a lesser extent the philippine police and when philippine leaders have shown a commitment to democratic politics and governance the u s government has been quick to proclaim solidarity therefore at a time when human rights and democracy are under attack in the philippines the u s government and american ngos ought to support filipino led efforts to defend human rights and democracy doing so would have the added benefit of showing filipinos that the u s philippine relationship is not only about advancing u s security and economic interests moreover the philippines is not china vietnam or cambodia where the prospects for democracy are negligible in the short to medium term the situation in the philippines is dynamic and investments in human rights and democracy have the potential to make a difference despite duterte s efforts to weaken checks on his power there are civil society media religious and educational organizations and even some members of the business elite that are committed to defending democracy like trump in the united states duterte has become a catalyst for a struggle between vastly different visions of what kind of country the philippines can and should be this is a contest filipino democrats need to win but in doing so they will need to offer something better than just a return to the pre duterte status quo naturally there are no quick or easy fixes the goal of more robust american support for democracy in the philippines should be twofold first and most immediately to promote greater solidarity among small d democrats in the philippines the united states and around the world and second to improve and expand the sharing of ideas and strategies for how to defend and strengthen democratic institutions and norms illustratively in the near term the united states could support filipino efforts on the following fronts improve understanding in the philippines of effective approaches to countering illegal drugs develop effective responses to the duterte government s anti human rights narrative and broaden the community of human rights supporters and activists and promote solidarity and sharing lessons for defending human rights and democracy by supporting visits to the philippines of human rights advocates democratic political leaders and scholars on democracy longer term americans and filipinos should work together to address common challenges to preserving and improving democracy this could include joint efforts to improve the role of media social media in democracy reform political finance and strengthen political parties strengthen school based and civic education on human rights and democracy and build university to university ties including scholarly collaboration on key aspects of philippine politics and society such as poverty and inequality criminality and the illicit economy supreme court decisionmaking and the political role of the middle class finally a u s house of representatives controlled by the democrats holds out the possibility of greater congressional attention to the situation in the philippines members of congress should consider pushing the trump administration to apply magnitsky global act sanctions to current and former pnp leaders responsible for ejks a more robust american response will prompt some filipinos to accuse the united states of meddling in the philippines domestic affairs duterte s supporters will almost certainly portray it as effort to destabilize his government therefore support must be transparent and nonpartisan and those providing it will need to be prepared to take some heat ideally this should not be a solely american project it should involve democratic groups elsewhere including in australia canada europe japan south korea and taiwan as long as strategic and security interests dominate u s policy toward the philippines and with the u s congress largely consumed with domestic politics it is unlikely that the u s government will take meaningful steps to support human rights and democracy in the philippines therefore american ngos foundations and universities will need to step up and take the lead but ultimately it will be the actions of filipino democrats that matter most about the author

mine alone and do not reflect the views of any of the organizations with which i am or have been affiliated notes 1 this is not to ignore the considerable influence that the united states has had on philippine politics and policymaking post independence but u s influence has declined significantly over the past quarter century 2 although the philippine political elite is frequently referred to as an oligarchy the true oligarchs are the twenty or thirty richest tycoons and their families most of whom have created the large business conglomerates that dominate the philippine economy political families such as the marcoses and cojuangcos are wealthy by almost any standard but the business families such as the sys gokongweis ayalas and aboitizes control vast business empires and have personal net worths in the billions of dollars little scholarly attention has been paid to how these families influence politics and policymaking 3 poverty incidence among filipinos registered at 21 6

voters select the president and vice president separately and not as a single ticket as a result since 1992 all elected vice presidents have been affiliated with parties different from the president s this has had multiple perverse consequences including causing the vice president to become a rival of the president s preferred successor 10 see julio teehankee was duterte s rise inevitable in nicole

in 1931 with gold standard exit the st louis federal reserve recently released this interesting chart on consumer prices from 1209 to present we added the price of gold to the chart to show the direct relationship between declining purchasing power in the british pound and the sterling price of gold after 1931 the year britain departed the gold standard prior to 1931 there was an occasional minor bump higher in the price of gold but for the most part it followed along the same flat line as consumer prices it was only after britain separated the pound from gold in 1931 that the price began to move radically higher in terms of the currency it gained significant momentum after 1971 when the bretton woods agreement was abolished currencies and gold were then allowed to move freely in international markets though interesting from an historical perspective the real lesson in this chart is that when a nation state goes from gold backed to fiat money gold coins and bullion become a logical and worthwhile alternative for citizen investors even after 730 years of relative price stability sources bank of england ice benchmark administration limited st louis federal reserve the naughty boy who blurts out unpleasant truths in the first place the classic writers without neglecting other cases reasoned primarily in terms of an unfettered international gold standard there were several reasons for this but one of them merits our attention in particular an unfettered international gold standard will keep normally foreign exchange rates within specie points and impose an automatic link between national price levels and interest rates the modern mind dislikes this automatism as much for political as for economic reasons it dislikes the fetters this automatism clasps on government management of the economic process dislikes gold the naughty boy who blurts out unpleasant truths but most of the economists of the period under survey liked it for precisely the same reasons though they compromised in practice as in theory and though they admitted central bank management the automatism a phrase beloved by lord overstone was for them who are neither nationalists nor etatistes a moral as well as an economic ideal joseph schumpeter history of economic analysis 1954 published posthumously editor s note to dr schumpeter s well considered discourse on the practical merits of the gold standard i will add a simple thought of my own absent the gold standard the prudent investor who stores gold benefits in concert with the blurting out those unpleasant truths if you have an interest in the kind of analysis you are now reading you might appreciate our live daily newsletter news opinion and analysis as it happens always timely and posted for gold and silver owners or for those thinking about owning it the world s biggest hedge fund is getting whacked the snb swiss national bank writes dollar collapse s john rubino loaded up on big tech like apple amazon and microsoft and rode them to massive profits which enriched both the swiss people and the snb s stockholders in another departure it s a publicly traded company as well as a central bank but live by the sword die by the sword turning your central bank into the world s biggest hedge fund means outsized profits in good times but potentially serious losses if those aggressive bets go wrong there was a time when gold was the centerpiece of the swiss international banking enterprise it seems as rubino points out the snb has departed from its original impeccable standards to mixed results will high volatility lead the gold market higher as it has in the past high volatility in the past has preceded the upward movement in the gold price in a recent article under the headline wild days return to stock market as vix surges like never before bloomberg points out that volatility is now running at levels not seen since the 2008 2009 breakdown and in fact the biggest annual surge on record as you can see in the chart below there was a lag in gold s response to the early phases of the 2008 2009 financial crisis its move upward came once investors realized the full extent of the crisis from there gold pushed to its all time highs did we learn anything from the last crisis at this point the prevailing view holds that qe worked writes credit bubble bulletin s doug noland moreover central banks are seen ready and willing to call upon money printing operations as need the great virtue of this policy course many believe is that there is essentially no limit to the scope and duration of qe infinity the ft quoted mario draghi is permanent and may be usable in contingencies that the governing council will assess in its independence melvyn krauss from the hoover institution captured conventional thinking no one willingly walks into a room from which there is no exit because qe proved temporary because it worked and because it has ended it is likely to be used again when we read of the credit bubble inflated in the form of collateralized loan obligations clos as explicitly identified recently by former fed chair janet yellen one wonders if we learned anything at all from the credit crisis of 2008 and its aftermath we subsequently learned that japanese banks were at risk for over 1 trillion in sliced diced and reconstituted clos noland s concerns are well considered in fact as the highly respected hedge fund manager henry druckenmiller recently pointed out we ve tripled doubled down on what caused that crisis and we tripled down on it globally clos in the contemporary context are today what mortgage backed securities were to financial markets in 2007 and to a great degree the general public is not even aware such a thing exists noland s remarks in full are highly recommended gold s provided a real rate of return in twelve of the last eighteen years since the turn of the new century gold consistently provided a real rate of return on investment when measured against inflation in fact it provided a real rate of return in twelve of the eighteen years represented on the chart the period was one of subdued inflation gold s performance as a result took many analysts and professional money managers by surprise and altered the perception among money managers that the precious metal is solely an inflation hedge 2018 ends in sea of red amidst a sea of red for 2018 stock market volatility comes out the clear winner in what many will see as appropriate for a year that will be remembered as one that most would like to forget bitcoin came out at the bottom of the list down 43 65 gold in a victory of sorts finished down only 4 21 on the year silver by contrast was down 11 82 and the dow jones industrial average was down 6 53 notable quotable problems are likely to continue in emerging markets compounded by rising interest rates and the us fed s monetary policy which has drained global dollar liquidity we have already seen the impact on the turkish and argentinian currencies we remain concerned about geo political problems including brexit north korea and the middle east at a time when populism is spreading globally the resolution of these problems in this unpredictable era will surely be difficult in 9 11 and in the 2008 financial crisis the powers of the world worked together with a common approach co operation

new commitments with great caution lord jacob rothschild rit capital partners half yearly financial report june 30 2018 at this stage of an ageing economic cycle investors have good reason for concern as they try to work out whether the rout in equity and credit markets represents a final correction in this cycle or the start of lengthy decline we have not begun a new year in such a glum mood since the start of 2009 and before that 1999 michael mackenzie financial times as the unwind continues financial assets inflated by the free money effects of qe are still finding new equilibrium valuations markets will remain volatile tech change and supply fundamentals will continue to shock us look at oil prices for an example turning a good year for oil and energy into a question mark or look at how iphone sales in india have fallen off a cliff as people buy cheaper phones that do the same commoditisation the thing that scares me most is liquidity the lack of it bill blain blain s morning porridge alan greenspan says the party s over on wall street the former federal reserve chairman who famously warned more than two decades ago about irrational exuberance in the stock market doesn t see equity prices going any higher than they are now it would be very surprising to see it sort of stabilize here and then take off greenspan said in an interview with cnn anchor julia chatterley he added that markets could still go up further but warned investors that the correction would be painful at the end of that run run for cover donna borak cnbc editor s note greenspan over the years has consistently advocated gold ownership as a means to hedging the next financial crisis europe has brought us a depression worse than 1929 it has led to entire peoples being broken and humiliated like

of capital compared to banks before the 2008 crisis most derivatives were cleared by trading parties in direct dealings the g20 shift has lifted the share of ccps for interest rate derivatives from 20 to 60 percent the effect is to concentrate risk the bis warns that the system may encourage a rush for the exit in events of extreme stress the international monetary fund has also flagged the dangers it warned this year that ccps increase the risk of a failure of the infrastructure itself and could lead to a catastrophe if all the layers of defense were overrun by a big default it would be like the failure of the maginot line ambrose evans pritchard bis warns of seizure at heart of financial clearing system for we have reached a critical point in a sense it is true that the mists are lifting we can at least see clearly the gulf to which our present path is leading few of us doubt that we must without much more delay find an effective means to raise world prices or we must expect the

is that when a nation state goes from gold backed to fiat money gold coins and bullion become a logical and worthwhile alternative for citizen investors even after 730 years of relative price stability sources bank of england ice benchmark administration limited st louis federal reserve the naughty boy who blurts out unpleasant truths in the first place the classic writers without neglecting other cases reasoned primarily in terms of an unfettered international gold standard there were several reasons for this but one of them merits our attention in particular an unfettered international gold standard will keep normally foreign exchange rates within specie points and impose an automatic link between national price levels and interest rates the modern mind dislikes this automatism as much for political as for economic reasons it dislikes the fetters this automatism clasps on government management of the economic process dislikes gold the naughty boy who blurts out unpleasant truths but most of the economists of the period under survey liked it for precisely the same reasons though they compromised in practice as in theory and though they admitted central bank management the automatism a phrase beloved by lord overstone was for them who are neither nationalists nor etatistes a moral as well as an economic ideal joseph schumpeter history of economic analysis

dollar is turning mixed in asian session today but it remains the weakest one for the week the greenback was knocked down by a wave of cautious comments from fed officials as well as the fomc minutes in short fed could be patient before making another rate move and this is actually inline with market pricing that fed will not raise interest rates again this year the deadlock over us government shutdown is another factor weighing on dollar trump stormed out of the talks with democrat leaders of the congress yesterday and complained the meeting at the white house was a total waste of time elsewhere in the currency markets canadian dollar is the weakest one for today after yesterday s boc rate decision boc stood pat and lowered 2019 growth and inflation forecast new zealand dollar

officials yesterday were generally cautious in tone and it seems there is consensus that fed should be patient before making another rate hike boston fed president eric rosengren said there should be no particular bias toward raising or lowering rates until the data more clearly indicate the path for domestic and international economic growth and he added i believe we can wait for greater clarity before adjusting policy chicago fed president charles evans said because inflation is not showing any meaningful sign of heading above 2 percent i feel we have good capacity to wait and carefully take stock of the incoming data and other developments atlanta fed president raphael bostic said the appropriate response is to be patient in adjusting the stance of policy and to wait for greater clarity about the direction of the economy and the risks to the outlook fomc minutes of the december meeting also reflected the cautious tone they noted that many participants expressed the view that especially in an environment of muted inflation pressures the committee could afford to be patient about further policy firming also a number of participants noted that before making further changes to the stance of policy it was important for the committee to assess factors including risks on growth and the impact of past rate hikes on the economy summary of statements from china mofcom and ustr on trade talks in a relatively brief statement the chinese ministry of commerce said the trade talks with the us this week were extensive and laid down the foundation for resolving trade friction between the countries the mofcom statement said the two sides actively implemented the important consensus of the two heads of state and conducted extensive in depth and meticulous exchanges on trade issues and structural issues of common concern which enhanced mutual understanding and laid the foundation for resolving mutual concerns both parties agreed to continue to maintain close contact in a rather neutral statement the us trade representative detailed the discussions with china in beijing on january 7 9 here are what were discussed ways to achieve fairness reciprocity and balance in trade relations ongoing verification and effective enforcement of the agreement achieving needed structural changes in china also china s pledge to purchase a substantial amount of agricultural energy manufactured goods and other products and services were also discussed eu trade commissioner malmström insists on excluding agriculture in trade negotiation with us eu trade commissioner cecilia malmström told reporters yesterday that the scope of trade negotiation with the us was not agreed upon yet but she emphasized that we have made very clear agriculture will not be included in the mean time eu also haven t got assurance from the us on holding off auto tariffs during the trade negotiation but malmström believed eu won t be affected while talks were ongoing malmström made the comments after meeting japanese minister of the economy hiroshige seko and u s trade representative robert lighthizer in washington yesterday in preparation for another meeting later this week regarding wto reforms european commission is currently preparing two mandates for trade negotiations with the us one is for removal of tariffs of industrial goods another one is on areas of possible regulatory cooperation in areas such as pharmaceuticals medical devices and cyber security the mandates will first have to go through european commission approval and then the 28 members of eu states there is no set time line for the preparation yet separately republican senator chuck grassley warned that i don t know how anybody in europe that wants a free trade agreement with us can expect it to get through the us senate if you don t want to negotiate agriculture uk hammond no specific benefits in the current brexit deal just much worse with no deal chancellor of the exchequer philip hammond said i firmly believe that my job is to look after the welfare and interests of the british people and i conclude that it would not be in their interests to leave without a deal we are very determined that we need a deal we need a deal that allows us to continue to cooperate and to have a smooth and orderly exit and we ll make sure that we do he urged that what we and many other british businesses need most urgently is for politicians from all sides to come together and pass a pragmatic agreement that allows an orderly brexit though he added that we don t see any specific benefits in the current deal it s just a lot less bad than a no deal but as five day debate over uk prime minister theresa may s brexit deal began in the parliament yesterday there is apparently no breakthrough hammond said there is currently no plan b to break the deadlock boc stood pat downgraded 2019 growth forecasts on temporary factors boc left the policy rate unchanged at 1 75 in january policymakers admitted that the decline in oil price has material impact on the economy yet they viewed the impact as transitory reflecting the view on economy projections the central bank downgraded the gdp growth forecast for this year but upgraded it for the next year similarly inflation is trimmed for this year due to weakness in oil prices on the monetary policy stance boc retained the view that interest rates would need to rise and the decision would be data dependent yet this time the central bank added that a rate hike would come over time and the pace would highly depend on developments in oil markets the canadian housing market and global trade policy more in boc pushed back timing for next rate hike trimmed gdp growth and inflation forecasts for 2019 on the data front uk brc retail sales monitor

turned back to the downside for retesting 104 69 low first in case of another recovery upside should be limited 109 46 minor resistance overall larger downtrend from 118 65 2016 high is expected to resume finally through 104 62 after current consolidation from 104 69 completes in the bigger picture price actions from 125 85 2015 high are seen as a long term corrective pattern no change in this view apparently such corrective pattern is not completed yet fall from 114 54 is seen as part of the falling leg from 118 65 2016 high break of 104 62 will target 100 projection of 118 65 to 104 62 from 114 54 at 100 51 which is close to 100 psychological level but in that case we d expect strong support from 98 97 to contain downside to bring reversal also this bearish case will remain the preferred one as long as 114 54 resistance holds economic indicators update
it is time to stop fretting about the debt to be sure 200bn is a very large number and when you divide it up among the people living here it comes out as 42 000 per person that s an eye watering number and in a country where average annual wages before tax are 46 402 based on central statistics office data for 2017 a scary one that s because it implies that if creditors came calling for all the money ireland owed them we individually would all be broke it is just as well that is not the way government finances work yes excessive debt creation through tax cuts and overspending of the kind we saw in the run up to the crisis is not to be welcomed but the government is not constrained by the kind of shopping list economics once espoused by former british prime minister margaret thatcher we need to realise that the headline number is not going to shrink very much at all over the coming years but we should also realise that the number itself is not the most important thing it is the ratio to the size of the economy whether measured by gross domestic product gdp or some variation of gross national income gni we have already undergone the fastest and most dramatic turnaround in its financial position of any country since the financial crisis hit and the state also has other duties that should now be coming to the forefront of fiscal policy relating to reducing chronic levels of inequality and lack of opportunity here come the next economic downturn or even recession it is the government alone that will be able to provide the firepower to help turn it around as the european central bank is not going to start setting policy for the 4 8 million people on this green speck in the atlantic even if it wanted to it simply doesn t have the firepower on average nominal interest rates those before taking inflation into account have been cut by 5 5 percentage points in the euro area since 1970 according to a publication this week by the national bureau for economic research that was authored by among others former us treasury secretary larry summers who is now at harvard with the ecb s rate on bank overnight deposits which is currently its primary interest rate tool remaining at minus 0 40pc any stimulus provided by the central bank would take interest rates even deeper into negative territory so that leaves ireland and a look at where we have come from shows that we do have some fiscal space in 2010 the budget deficit after recognising the liabilities from the financial sector was almost a third of the nation s economic output now thanks to a stellar economic growth and a huge helping hand from tax payments by multinational companies ireland ended last year with a small budget surplus analysis from the department of finance shows that a one off hit to economic growth of 3 5 percentage points versus their forecasts would result in the ratio of debt to gross national income being 25 percentage points higher by say 2025 than otherwise crucially however it would still be on a downward path and we would remain within the constraints of the stability and growth pact rules even if they are miscalibrated for ireland due to the impact of the operations of foreign multinationals here it is not as if all those billions of euro from the multinationals that are flooding into government coffers do not exist they do and yes there is a risk they may dry up but it is real money and the state had a real budget surplus last year for the first time in 12 years you don t have to learn to love the nation s debt and you don t have to just take my word for it former international monetary fund chief economist olivier blanchard sent shockwaves through the economic community when he spoke this week at the american economic association and said that warnings over high indebtedness among rich nations were overdone blanchard one of the world s most respected economists argued that as safe interest rates were expected to remain low for a long time the issuance of debt without a later increase in taxes may well be feasible what do i want you to go away with not the notion that debt is good but that debt might not be so bad blanchard said he was of course speaking about the united states where a surge in debt thanks to president donald trump s tax cuts has pushed the public debt to gross domestic product ratio to around 88pc but the same argument applies here the yield on 10 year government bond is around 0 90pc it is projected by the organisation for economic cooperation and development to be 1 4pc in 2020 even the most pessimistic official growth forecast for ireland in 2020 which is about as far out as economists can really see is 3 4pc from the oecd so the same argument that blanchard makes for the united states also applies here don t forget the state s debt as a percentage of gni has already fallen by a whopping 55pc points from its peak in 2012 and stood at 111pc of gni at the end of 2017 that so called fiscal consolidation was achieved at huge cost which mainly fell on the poorest in society a continued fetishisation of debt levels will see them again bear the costs of cuts the percentage of people at risk of poverty in ireland remains elevated by the standards of other wealthy european union nations even though it has fallen sharply since the recession it still stands at 15 7pc the vulnerabilities of society were neatly illustrated in this week s unemployment numbers which showed that the percentage of people out of work had fallen to pre recession lows despite this the gains have not been uniformly spread and the youth unemployment rate remains elevated at 12 2pc according to tasc a think tank focused on economic inequality our proportion of low paid jobs is 24pc double the rate of other small open economies in the european union and 10pc points above the european union 15 average after the austerity years the budget needs to focus on access to decent housing and health for all as well as providing training for young people who are excluded from the labour market finance minister paschal donohoe has already moved to shore up government revenues with the ending of a vat exemption for the hospitality industry that had cost the state 2 6bn to the end of 2017 he says he has plans for more changes in the tax regime what is also interesting is that mr donohoe recently wrote a review of a book by economist paul collier called the future of capitalism which discussed widening inequality that suggests that mr donohoe is well aware of the issues confronting ireland and the need for a more inclusive growth model hopefully he will use his stewardship of government finances to deliver

of other currencies the impact of continued us rate rises on fund flows may be dramatic and will continue to draw liquidity out of emerging markets causing some unpleasant currency swings trump may use this to try and persuade the fed to slow down its rate of rate rises but the higher rates will help trump raise further funds to support his fiscal program if allowed trump is no stranger to debt

paul bosma commented that its recovery is good news as we start mining across the pit towards the northern side of the orebody over the coming months liqhobong has a track record of producing large high value diamonds in october for example a 68 carat white diamond the third most valuable stone sold to date for just under us 1 0m and a 20 carat fancy yellow diamond liqhobong also recovered the largest diamond to date described as a 326 carat near gem diamond the company also reports a stabilisation in pricing for the smaller lower value stones 3 grainers at the recent sale which was

account of the monetary policy meeting of the governing council of the european central bank held in frankfurt am main on wednesday and thursday 12 13 december 2018 1 review of financial economic and monetary developments and policy options financial market developments mr cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments since the governing council s previous monetary policy meeting on 24 25 october 2018 there were growing signs that investors were becoming more concerned about the global growth outlook reflecting both the weakness in recent economic data in many jurisdictions and continuing geopolitical tensions these concerns had added to market volatility and likely contributed to a marked drop in global stock prices corporate bond spreads both in the united states and in the euro area had widened too in particular for bonds with lower credit quality in euro area government bond markets yields on bonds of the highest credit quality had declined to levels seen early in 2018 reflecting both a demand for safety and a fall in inflation expectations part of the fall in inflation expectations likely echoed a measurable drop in oil prices in recent weeks which were down by 30 on early october a model based decomposition of oil price movements indicated that factors of both supply and demand had likely contributed to the decline in oil prices euro area sovereign bond spreads had eased somewhat from recent highs however yield spreads between the ten year italian government bond and its german equivalent remained at elevated levels of slightly below 300 basis points contagion from italy to other euro area sovereign bond markets remained contained turning to euro area equity markets two broad factors were seen to have accounted for the recent correction a rise in the equity risk premium which was consistent with the growing demand for safe haven assets in global bond markets and a downward revision in earnings expectations in the united states by contrast earnings expectations were seen to have continued to push stock prices higher while the increase in the equity risk premium had pulled us stocks lower finally with regard to monetary policy expectations in the euro area both survey results and market based evidence were signalling a push back in the expectations for the timing of a first rise in key ecb interest rates and in the subsequent expected future path of short term interest rates at longer tenors market pricing had exhibited a more pronounced adjustment which could have also reflected changes in risk premia the global environment and economic and monetary developments in the euro area mr praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area regarding the external environment global growth momentum was moderating and global trade growth stabilising global survey indicators pointed to a deceleration in economic activity in the second half of 2018 the global composite output purchasing managers index pmi had increased somewhat in november but overall still pointed to a weakening of growth relative to the first half of 2018 the latest indicators on trade gave mixed signals while pointing overall towards broad stabilisation the volume of goods imports had increased in september however the global pmi for new export orders in the manufacturing sector remained slightly below 50 in november annual consumer price inflation in the oecd area had picked up in october excluding energy and food inflation had remained largely stable wage dynamics appeared to have gained momentum since the turn of 2017 18 with annual growth in compensation per employee reaching 2 9 in the third quarter of 2018 brent crude oil prices had declined markedly since the 24 25 october meeting as oil production had increased and growth in oil demand was expected to slow over the same period aggregate non oil commodity prices had decreased by 3 while the euro exchange rate was broadly unchanged both against the us dollar and in nominal effective terms turning to the euro area growth in economic activity had slowed further on account of weaker external demand and also sector and country specific factors eurostat s second release had put euro area real gdp growth in the third quarter of 2018 at 0 2 in quarter on quarter terms down from 0 4 in each of the previous two quarters data that had become available since the governing council s previous monetary policy meeting had been weaker than expected at the same time the fundamental factors supporting the economic expansion remained in place in the medium term private consumption was expected to remain resilient reflecting mainly continued growth in compensation of employees which over time was expected to be driven more by growth in compensation per employee and less by employment growth business investment was expected to continue growing at a solid pace supported by favourable earnings expectations resilient domestic demand and favourable financing conditions however the ongoing uncertainty surrounding global trade and tariffs was likely to be a factor weighing on business investment this assessment was broadly reflected in the december 2018 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area these projections foresaw annual real gdp increasing by 1 9 in 2018 1 7 in 2019 1 7 in 2020 and 1 5 in 2021 compared with the september 2018 ecb staff macroeconomic projections the outlook for real gdp growth had been revised slightly down for 2018 and 2019 turning to price developments according to eurostat s flash estimate euro area annual hicp inflation had declined to 2 0 in november 2018 from 2 2 in october reflecting mainly a decline in energy inflation hicp inflation excluding energy and food was also lower edging down to 1 0 in november from 1 1 in october owing to a slowing in the services component meanwhile a broader range of underlying inflation measures had continued to move sideways incoming data pointed to building wage pressures which were expected to support an upward adjustment in underlying inflation annual growth in compensation per employee was 2 5 in the third quarter of 2018 up from 2 2 in the second quarter the increase had continued to be broad based both across sectors and across countries according to the december eurosystem staff projections hicp inflation was projected to decrease from 1 8 in 2018 to 1 6 in 2019 before gradually increasing to 1 7 in 2020 and 1 8 in 2021 this drawn out v shaped pattern reflected two offsetting trends over time a decline in the annual rate of growth of the energy component as the impact of past increases in oil prices faded and gradually rising underlying inflation on account of an increasingly positive output gap in the context of rising supply constraints and tightening labour markets compared with the september 2018 ecb staff projections the outlook for hicp inflation had been revised up by 0 1 percentage point for 2018 and down by 0 1 percentage point for 2019 while it remained unchanged for 2020 market based measures of inflation expectations had fallen somewhat since the 24 25 october monetary policy meeting mostly in response to the steep decline in the price of oil the five year forward inflation linked swap rate five years ahead stood at 1 6 slightly lower than the level prevailing at the time of the october meeting financial conditions continued to be accommodative amid heightened market volatility meanwhile the expected timing of lift off in key ecb interest rates had shifted out to around the end of 2019 euro area equity markets had declined due to lower earnings growth expectations and a higher equity risk premium at the same time the overall cost of financing for euro area firms had remained very favourable turning to money and credit developments the annual growth rate of broad money m3 had continued on its slightly decelerating path although the latest reading for october showed a rebound to 3 9 domestic sources of money creation had remained the main driver of m3 growth the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector had been broadly stable in october standing at 3 3 after 3 4 in september at the euro area level lending rates had remained very favourable and close to their historical lows euro area banks composite funding costs had remained accommodative despite some limited increase in the yields on bank bonds as regards fiscal policy the euro area general government deficit ratio was projected to increase over the period 2019 21 on account of a loosening fiscal stance measured as the change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance in both 2019 and 2020 monetary policy considerations and policy options summing up mr praet observed that financial conditions had remained accommodative in the context of heightened market volatility overall the ecb s monetary policy had contributed to dampening the impact of prevailing uncertainties on financial conditions credit conditions for households and firms had remained very supportive incoming data on growth had been weaker than expected reflecting softer external demand but also some country and sector specific factors while some of these factors were likely to unwind the latest data could indicate a moderation in the growth momentum at the same time the fundamentals underpinning the euro area economic expansion remained in place this was also consistent with the december 2018 eurosystem staff projections which pointed to a continued expansion at a pace closer to potential the risks surrounding the growth outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced however the balance of risks was moving to the downside owing to the persistent prominence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the threat of protectionism vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted but domestic cost pressures were continuing to strengthen amid high levels of capacity utilisation tightening labour markets and rising wages the december eurosystem staff projections broadly confirmed the inflation outlook foreseen in both the june and september projection exercises this overall assessment continued to support confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to levels below but close to 2 would proceed and be maintained even after the end of net purchases under the asset purchase programme app at the same time continued inflation convergence still required an ample degree of monetary accommodation on the basis of these considerations mr praet proposed a concluding app net asset purchases at the end of december 2018 b keeping the ecb forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates unchanged and c specifying the guidance on reinvestments by expressing the governing council s intention to continue to reinvest in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when the governing council started raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation linking the reinvestment horizon to the interest rate lift off signalled that the forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates was the governing council s primary tool for adjusting the monetary policy stance this chained guidance would strengthen the impact of rate guidance on financial conditions because market expectations for the reinvestment horizon would evolve in line with expectations for the date of a first interest rate rise it was furthermore important for communication to a stress that the incoming information had been weaker than expected but that the underlying strength of domestic demand continued to underpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures b acknowledge that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced but that the balance of risks was moving to the downside owing to the persistent prominence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the threat of protectionism vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility c underline the governing council s confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to its aim would continue in the period ahead and would be maintained even after the end of net asset purchases under the app d reiterate that the forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets continued to provide the necessary degree of monetary accommodation for the sustained convergence of inflation to the governing council s aim e reconfirm that the governing council expected the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels below but close to 2 over the medium term and f announce that the governing council intended to reinvest in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation turning to monetary policy implementation issues mr cœuré recalled that even though the key principles guiding the net asset purchase phase would also prevail during the reinvestment phase some technical adjustments were required to the way the eurosystem would conduct its reinvestments the first main element related to the operational target during the reinvestment phase the cumulative net asset purchases made under all four constituent app programmes would be maintained at their end december 2018 levels limited temporary deviations in the overall size and composition of the app might occur for operational reasons within the public sector purchase programme pspp the aim was also to keep the respective shares in the stock of purchases for eu supranational bonds on the one hand and for government and agency bonds on the other hand at their end december 2018 levels the second main element related to the allocation of reinvestments under the pspp across jurisdictions this would continue to be guided on a stock basis by the respective national central banks subscription to the ecb capital key as amended over time as a rule therefore redemptions would be reinvested in the jurisdiction in which principal repayments were made but the portfolio allocation across jurisdictions would continue to be adjusted with a view to bringing the share of the pspp portfolio into closer alignment with the respective national central banks subscriptions to the ecb capital key any adjustment to the portfolio allocation across jurisdictions would be gradual and would be calibrated as appropriate to safeguard orderly market conditions during the reinvestment phase the eurosystem would continue to adhere to the principle of market neutrality via smooth and flexible implementation to this end the reinvestment of principal redemptions would be distributed over the year to allow for a regular and balanced market presence within the pspp purchases of securities with a yield to maturity below the interest rate on the ecb s deposit facility would continue to be undertaken to the extent necessary the third main element related to the reinvestment modalities for the private sector programmes market capitalisation would continue to be the guiding principle for reinvestment purchases under these programmes while an adequate degree of flexibility in implementation would be needed for a smooth implementation purchases of securities in primary markets would continue to be permitted as necessary finally mr cœuré recalled that at the start of the reinvestment phase all covered bonds with a conditional pass through structure would be excluded from further purchases under the third covered bond purchase programme 2 governing council s discussion and monetary policy decisions economic and monetary analyses with regard to the economic analysis members broadly shared the assessment of the outlook for economic activity in the euro area provided by mr praet in his introduction and they discussed the balance of risks incoming data on growth had been weaker than expected reflecting softer external demand but also some country and sector specific factors while some of these factors were likely to unwind the latest data could indicate a moderation in the growth momentum at the same time the fundamental factors underpinning the euro area economic expansion remained in place this outlook was broadly reflected in the december 2018 eurosystem staff projections which entailed a slight downward revision for real gdp growth in 2018 and 2019 compared with the september 2018 ecb staff projections and a gradual slowing of real gdp growth over the horizon from 1 9 in 2018 to 1 5 in 2021 following downward revisions in the march and june exercises in this context it was underlined that notwithstanding weaker data the baseline could still be considered valid and that the economy was still expected to grow at a pace close to potential the factors underpinning economic activity were reflected in developments in the main demand components ongoing employment gains and rising wages continued to support private consumption favourable financing conditions and improving balance sheets underpinned business investment and residential investment remained robust in addition the expansion in global activity was still expected to continue although at a slower pace and thus to support euro area exports the latest data including the decline in real gdp growth from 0 4 to 0 2 quarter on quarter in the third quarter had been weaker than expected while some of the country and sector specific factors behind this slowdown were likely to unwind the point was made that a number of indicators had of late declined substantially compared with their levels in 2017 conveying the picture of a slowing economy at the same time it was recalled that 2017 had been a very positive year with upside surprises the issue of whether the country and sector specific factors in the recent weakening of growth would be transitory or longer lasting had already been discussed at the governing council s previous monetary policy meeting and continued to warrant attention reference was again made to the impact of new emissions testing standards on car production and registration in the largest euro area economy members discussed in greater detail the risks to the euro area growth outlook uncertainties and risks related to geopolitical factors the threat of protectionism vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial volatility had remained prominent it was widely considered that uncertainty persisted or had increased with risks to activity moving to the downside it was also argued that even though certain downside risks regarding trade tensions emerging markets us monetary policy and developments in sovereign bond markets in the euro area had receded the continually changing nature of risks would sustain or even increase general uncertainty in this context it was underlined that the situation remained fragile and fluid as risks could quickly regain prominence or new uncertainties could emerge the situation in emerging markets was cited as an example with vulnerability related to some countries becoming less of a concern notably with turkey and argentina stabilising while vulnerability related to others was already looming other examples were the frequently changing state of discussion on trade issues and the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union against this background it was argued that the current environment could be described as one of risk rotation in a state of generally heightened uncertainty as regards the balance of risks on the one hand the view was expressed that a case could be made for assessing risks to activity as tilted to the downside prevailing uncertainty appeared to have affected confidence although the latter was coming down from high levels reference was made to a recent deterioration in business confidence with pmi survey data related to production and exports again disappointing this was seen as affecting business investment and cautioned against being complacent about downside risks to growth regarding the eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections it was noted that there had now been three successive downward revisions to the short term euro area baseline growth outlook over the past half year the latest revisions essentially reflected the incorporation of new data regarding the short term but had no bearing on the growth path for the remainder of the projection horizon therefore it was argued that unless all shocks affecting the latest figures were considered to be of a purely temporary nature this should have moved the balance of risks to the downside on the other hand it was argued that while there had recently been somewhat more negative news than positive news this had been incorporated in the downward revision to the baseline eurosystem staff projection such that the balance of risks pertaining to this new projection could be maintained as fairly balanced it was also remarked that the assessment of still balanced risks to growth was supported by the emergence of new upside risks namely a further decline in oil prices since the cut off date for the projections and the likelihood of more stimulus coming from fiscal measures against this background caution was expressed against moving the balance of risks to the downside all in all members concurred with the view that the risks to the euro area outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced but that the balance of risks was moving to the downside owing to the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the threat of protectionism vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial volatility this assessment struck the necessary balance between confidence in the medium term outlook and acknowledgment of the recent weakness in data and indicators with regard to price developments there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction according to eurostat s flash estimate euro area annual hicp inflation had declined to 2 0 in november from 2 2 in october reflecting mainly a decline in energy price inflation on the basis of current futures prices for oil headline inflation was likely to decrease over the coming months measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted but domestic cost pressures were continuing to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets which were pushing up wage growth looking ahead underlying inflation was expected to increase over the medium term supported by the ecb s monetary policy measures the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth this assessment was also broadly reflected in the december 2018 eurosystem staff projections compared with the september 2018 ecb staff projections the outlook for inflation had been revised slightly up for 2018 and down for 2019 hicp inflation excluding energy and food was projected to increase from 1 0 in 2018 to 1 8 in 2021 compared with the september 2018 ecb staff projections this implied a small downward revision of around 0 1 percentage point for each of the years between 2018 and 2020 as regards risks to the inflation outlook it was observed that the link between possible downside risks to the outlook for growth and corresponding risks for the outlook for inflation generally depended on the nature of shocks a major downside risk to the inflation projections but a probable upside risk to growth related to oil prices which were presently lower than they had been when the projections were finalised however it was argued that changes in oil prices could normally be expected to imply a risk mainly to the shorter term outlook that diminished over the relevant medium term policy horizon while it was also remarked that geopolitical tensions could make the drop in oil prices more protracted some reassurance regarding the outlook for underlying inflation was drawn from recent developments in wage growth growth in compensation per employee in the euro area as a whole had been 2 5 in the third quarter of 2018 continuing a steady increase seen since 2016 the pick up in wage growth had also become broader based across different euro area countries and sectors of the economy reference was made to the fact that wage developments were fairly dynamic in a number of euro area countries from a historical perspective members widely shared the view that the pass through of wages to prices in particular in the services sector was a key factor underpinning confidence in the outlook for underlying inflation it was argued that the extent of the pass through depended on the source of the shocks that were driving rising wage growth evidence suggested that the pass through could be expected to be stronger if the source was a demand shock but more moderate in the case of other shocks the transmission of higher wages to consumer price inflation was subject to time lags and it appeared that more time and patience were needed the argument was reiterated that the pass through should eventually occur as rising wage growth with unchanged price inflation implied a squeeze in profit margins and mark ups that could not continue indefinitely with regard to inflation expectations market based measures of longer term expectations had fallen somewhat from their levels at the time of the governing council s previous monetary policy meeting it was remarked that this could be due to the recent fall in oil prices since as also observed elsewhere there appeared to be a correlation between these two variables when oil prices were declining that was not observed symmetrically when oil prices were increasing at the same time it was recalled that the risk of negative inflation rates and deflation had long faded regarding fiscal policies the governing council reiterated the need for rebuilding fiscal buffers this was particularly important in countries where government debt was high and for which full adherence to the stability and growth pact was critical for safeguarding sound fiscal positions with regard to the monetary analysis members widely shared the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction the annual growth rate of m3 had rebounded somewhat in october the narrow monetary aggregate m1 continued to be the main contributor to broad money growth the gradual shift in the driver of the growth momentum of m3 from the app to a rising contribution from a sustained pick up in private sector credit had continued the gradual recovery in the growth of mfi loans to the private sector which had been observed since the beginning of 2014 was still proceeding credit creation was seen to enjoy continued support from the overall improvement in banks balance sheets which was also evidenced by the continued decline in the level of non performing loans reference was made to the latest survey on the access to finance of enterprises safe according to the survey results small and medium sized enterprises had continued to assess the availability of bank credit between april and september 2018 as ample euro area bank lending rates to households and non financial corporations had remained very attractive and close to their historical lows in this respect reference was made to developments in one euro area jurisdiction where sovereign bond yields remained at elevated levels while lending rates had so far not increased to the same extent if financial volatility continued some upward pressure on bank lending rates could be expected in that jurisdiction over time monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance members widely shared the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction while incoming information had been weaker than expected the underlying strength of domestic demand continued to underpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures this was seen to still support confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to the governing council s aim would proceed and be maintained even after the end of the net asset purchases at the same time significant monetary policy stimulus was still needed to support the further build up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term increased caution was warranted in the light of the persistent uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the threat of protectionism vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility which had remained prominent monetary policy needed to remain prudent patient and persistent and to continue to be data driven in the period ahead there was broad agreement that financial conditions remained accommodative and that credit conditions for households and firms were still very supportive in this respect the governing council s forward guidance had contributed to dampening the impact of prevailing uncertainties on financial conditions both the expected time period before a first increase in the key ecb interest rates and the expected reinvestment horizon had increased in response to the recent weaker than expected data this appeared to be in line with the state contingent elements of the governing council s forward guidance on both of these instruments and contributed to preserving the financial conditions necessary for sustained inflation convergence against this background all members agreed with the overall package of monetary policy proposals made by mr praet in his introduction this involved concluding net asset purchases under the app at the end of december keeping the forward guidance on the path of the key ecb interest rates unchanged and enhancing the forward guidance on reinvestment accordingly the governing council would state its intention to reinvest in full the principal payments from maturing securities for an extended period of time past the date of a first rise in interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation there was broad agreement among members that the overall monetary policy stance remained highly expansionary and would remain so even after net asset purchases ceased at the end of 2018 while the app was transitioning into a phase of zero net asset purchases the eurosystem would continue to make purchases under the programme in line with the governing council s enhanced forward guidance on reinvestments owing to the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the reinvestment of maturing principal as well as the governing council s forward guidance on interest rates ample monetary policy accommodation remained in place the enhanced forward guidance on reinvestments would adequately convey the governing council s intention to continue to fully reinvest maturing principal repayments over an extended period of time past the date of a first rise in the key ecb interest rates there was broad agreement among members that expressing the time dimension of the reinvestment guidance in terms of an extended period past the date when the governing council starts raising the key ecb interest rates struck an appropriate balance between giving additional guidance on reinvestments and maintaining flexibility and optionality for the period ahead furthermore linking the reinvestment horizon to the interest rate lift off was seen as signalling that the governing council s policy rate guidance was the primary tool for adjusting the monetary policy stance in the period ahead moreover the chained guidance would reinforce the impact of the governing council s interest rate guidance on financial conditions by ensuring that market expectations for the reinvestment horizon would evolve in line with expectations for the date of the lift off as a result term premium effects implied by reinvestments operating primarily at the long end of the yield curve would be consistent with changes in expectations regarding short term interest rates members underlined that specifying the forward guidance on the governing council s policy instruments in terms of both a time based and a state contingent leg had served it well hence there was broad agreement that the state contingent leg of the reinvestment guidance should be maintained accordingly the governing council should continue to reinvest in full maturing principal payments in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of accommodation at the same time it was noted that liquidity conditions also depended on liquidity provision in credit operations the fixed rate full allotment policy and other factors concerning the composition of the app there was broad agreement that all its constituent programmes should remain active during the reinvestment phase moreover their relative shares would be maintained at the levels prevailing at the end of the net purchase phase regarding the corporate sector purchase programme cspp a remark was made that the liquidity position of firms was comfortable and that the financial risks associated with the cspp were somewhat more pronounced than those of the other programmes at the same time it was emphasised that the risk management framework in place had proven effective moreover corporate bonds were inherently risky and it was recalled that the monetary policy objective of corporate bond purchases was paramount as regards the technical parameters for the reinvestment phase the overall approach adopted was widely seen as being finely balanced and all members supported the proposals set out by mr cœuré in his introduction accordingly for the pspp the allocation across eligible jurisdictions would continue to be guided on a stock basis by the respective national central banks subscription to the ecb capital key as amended over time as a rule therefore redemptions would be reinvested in the jurisdiction in which principal repayments were made but the portfolio allocation across jurisdictions would continue to be adjusted with a view to bringing the share of the pspp portfolio into closer alignment with the respective national central banks subscription to the ecb capital key furthermore it was emphasised that any adjustment to the portfolio allocation across jurisdictions would be gradual and calibrated as appropriate to safeguard orderly market conditions looking ahead the suggestion was made to revisit the contribution of targeted longer term refinancing operations to the monetary policy stance on communication members widely concurred with the elements proposed by mr praet in his introduction accordingly it was seen as appropriate to acknowledge that the incoming information had been weaker than expected but at the same time to stress that the underlying strength of domestic demand continued to underpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures it was important to underline that the governing council continued to be confident that the sustained convergence of inflation towards its aim would continue in the period ahead and would be maintained even after the end of the net asset purchases at the same time it was deemed appropriate to convey that this confidence was accompanied by increased caution while the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook could still be assessed as broadly balanced the balance of risks was moving to the downside it was seen as important to highlight that while the app was transitioning into a phase of zero net asset purchases the forthcoming reinvestments meant that asset purchases under the app would continue in line with the governing council s enhanced forward guidance it was hence seen as vital for communication to reiterate that the governing council s forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets would continue to provide the necessary degree of monetary accommodation for the sustained convergence of inflation to the governing council s aim in this respect communication should confirm that the governing council expected the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels below but close to 2 over the medium term and should specify that the governing council intended to continue to reinvest in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date of a first increase in the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation finally it was considered prudent to restate the governing council s readiness to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continued to move towards the governing council s inflation aim in a sustained manner monetary policy decisions and communication taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members on a proposal from the president the governing council decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0 00 0 25 and 0 40 respectively the governing council expected the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels below but close to 2 over the medium term regarding non standard monetary policy measures the net purchases under the app would end in december 2018 at the same time the governing council was enhancing its forward guidance on reinvestment accordingly the governing council intended to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date of a first rise in the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation as regards the technical parameters for the app reinvestment phase the governing council adopted the decisions as proposed which would be communicated in a technical press release the members of the governing council subsequently finalised the introductory statement which the president and the vice president would as usual deliver at the press conference following the end of the current governing council meeting introductory statement press releases meeting of the ecb s

monetary policy account foreseen on thursday 21 february 2019
wednesday s session saw the first major central bank meetings of the year as the bank of canada boc released their monetary policy report rate statement and overnight rate in line with expectations the boc maintained the overnight rate at 1 75 with corresponding bank rate at 2 and deposit rate at 1 5 despite matching investor predictions the releases prompted significant canadian dollar cad x rate volatility with spikes in both directions before settling largely unchanged from pre release levels the boc press release highlighted key risks to the outlook with growth expected to slow in the year ahead amid increasing signs that the us china trade conflict is weighing on global demand and commodity prices slumping oil prices were also highlighted as a dampening factor for the economic outlook with current prices approximately 25 lower than the monetary policy report s october forecasts and attributed to sustained increases in supplies from us producers alongside increased worries over global demand the press release said the drop in global oil prices has a material impact on the canadian outlook resulting in lower terms of trade and national income adding that while price differentials have narrowed in recent weeks following announced mandatory production cuts in alberta investment in canada s oil sector is projected to weaken further amid improved risk sentiment in light of apparent progress between us and chinese officials with a view to securing a trade deal to end reciprocal tariff hikes both west texas intermediate wti crude oil futures and brent crude oil bco regained key psychological price levels during wednesday s session at 50 barrel and 60 barrel respectively the release goes on to say that domestically the economy has been performing well overall growth has been running close to potential employment growth has been strong and unemployment is at a 40 year low adding forecasts that exports and non energy investment are projected to grow solidly supported by foreign demand the cusma the lower canadian dollar and federal tax measures targeted at investment consumer spending and housing investment were highlighted as key areas of underperformance with weaker than expected economic statistics attributed to higher interest rates and changes to mortgage guidelines the release also saw downgrades to real gdp expectations with the boc projecting that canadian economic growth will slow to 1 7 per cent this year before rebounding to 2 1 per cent in 2020 with the latter above potential growth forecast attributed to an expected uptick in demand primarily oil related prompting renewed momentum in early 2019 easing headline inflation in november was attributed to lower gasoline prices with bilateral effects from continued low fuel prices on the one hand expected to drag on inflation and upwards pressure from a depreciated canadian dollar on the other tipped to unwind over the course of the year with cpi returning to around the 2 per cent target by late 2019 advertisement rate supported canadian dollar cad tipped to rebound in 2019 while investor expectations of further hikes dwindled preceding the boc s releases a reuter s poll of more than fifty currency analysts found mean projections for the us to canadian dollar usdcad see the loonie appreciating versus its us counterpart by around 3 6 over the next 12 months to 1 28 the forecasts come following 2018 s severe decline of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar which saw losses of 8 4 over the course of the year with depreciation in q4 driven by the drastic slump in oil which accounts for around 10 of canada s exports with regards to rates market pricing doesn t anticipate any further hikes in the year ahead which given wednesday s boc reaffirmation that rates are expected to be raised leaves significant upside potential for the loonie ing s december projections broadly foreshadowed wednesday s policy decisions with developed market economist james smith outlining their expectations for rates in the year ahead in light of forecasted moderations in growth and and an expectation of developing upwards wage pressure putting all the pieces together we expect two rate hikes in 1q19 and 3q19 taking the policy rate towards the lower end of the boc s estimate of the nominal neutral rate 2 5 3 5 based on at target inflation adding we re not ruling out a third hike next year either depending on the strength of wage growth and if trade tensions remain in check chief currency strategist at scotiabank shaun osborne commented the general thesis here is that the bank has a bit more work to do on the rate front adding our base case is that the economy will grow above potential this year and next capacity constraints are becoming more evident we expect this to keep upward pressure on inflation senior fx strategist mazen issa of td securities said the macro outlook while it does suggest a deceleration in economic growth it is not a dynamic that threatens the bank of canada trajectory while predicting a couple of hikes later this year just back loaded risks to the outlook highlighted by td securities issa include financing of a current account deficit which has persisted through every quarter since 2009 a decline in auto part manufacturing which is expected to shift to mexico and a loss of competitiveness which could all weigh on canadian dollar cad for now however the canadian dollar cad remains buoyant with chief currency strategist at rbc adam cole commenting cad has started the year with good upwards momentum and for now we suggest running with it even though it might ultimately be another case of the january overshooting to which cad and aud and nzd is prone

g hazardous materials transportation 1 predictions and outlook for the u s department of transportation s pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration for 2019 the u s department of transportation s dot pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa is charged with a vital if often taken for granted task protecting the public from the hazards associated with the transportation in commerce of hazardous materials while its operations may lack the high profile of some of its federal sister agencies its mission is literally one of life and death lethal train derailments and explosions fires aboard aircraft and spills of toxic materials are all potential and real consequences if phmsa fails to exercise its duty effectively phmsa operates in a dynamic and challenging environment in 2019 the scope and complexity of its mission will continue to grow requiring it fundamentally to rethink how it will use data information and technology to achieve its safety goals phmsa s mission is to protect people and the environment by advancing the safe transportation of energy and other hazardous materials that are essential to our daily lives to do this it establishes national policy sets and enforces standards educates and conducts research to prevent incidents it also prepares the public and first responders to reduce consequences if an incident does occur in this context phmsa has updated its strategic framework to focus on risk reduction and much of what it is anticipated to do in 2019 reflects this revamped strategy phmsa oversees the safe movement of hazardous materials and energy related products the consistently safe delivery of these commodities supports the growth of american industry ensuring that packagers shippers and transporters can move these products to the consumers homes and businesses that rely on them phmsa s safety programs advance industry safety systems promote safety standards encourage innovation and research provide comprehensive safety inspections and when necessary initiate enforcement actions phmsa is responsible for promoting the safe and reliable transportation of dangerous goods by air water highway rail and pipeline the expansive u s pipeline network extends more than 2 7 million miles and moves more than 16 billion barrels of hazardous liquids and gases safely and without incident 99 9997 percent of the time and phmsa s safety operations add less than one cent per barrel to achieve this unmatched safe delivery rate surface air and vessel transportation of hazardous materials accounts for more than 2 7 billion tons of regulated hazardous products annually with a value of 3 1 trillion dollars despite the amount of activity and risk posed by hazardous materials safe delivery occurs 99 9994 percent of the time phmsa s safety operations add about three cents per ton of material shipped to maintain this significant rate phmsa works to improve the safety systems of the more than 40 000 companies involved in the commercial manufacture packaging and transportation of dot regulated hazardous commodities as well as the operators responsible for the nation s expansive 2 7 million mile network of liquid and gas pipelines phmsa s authorities extend to transportation of hazardous materials by pipeline rail air and highway this forecast does not address pipeline hazardous materials issues new information and research will drive much of what phmsa undertakes in 2019 advances in technology enhanced commerce and a rapidly evolving global trade in hazardous materials must be matched by phmsa if it is to satisfy its mandates at this point phmsa appears to recognize these new challenges and is poised to maintain its highly honed edge on hazardous materials transportation 1 1 fast act implementation high hazard flammable trains in 2019 phmsa is expected to continue to carry out the legislative requirements in the fixing america s surface transportation fast act of 2015 pub l no 114 94 that call for phmsa to improve the safe movement of liquefied natural gas and crude oil transported by rail on december 4 2015 president obama signed the fast act into law the new law requires phmsa to undertake a number of regulatory and other actions to safeguard the transportation of flammable crude oil by rail and highway passage of the act was catalyzed by a number of incidents involving so called high hazard flammable trains phmsa is slated to promulgate a final rule pursuant to the fast act that will expand the applicability of comprehensive oil spill response plans based on thresholds of liquid petroleum that apply to an entire train the rulemaking would also require railroads to share information about high hazard flammable train operations with state and tribal emergency response commissions the rule also will include a reference to an initial boiling point test for flammable liquids for better consistency with the american national standards institute and the american petroleum institute recommended practice 3000 classifying and loading of crude oil into rail tank cars phmsa is considering revising the hazardous materials regulations hmr to establish vapor pressure limits for unrefined petroleum based products and potentially all class 3 flammable liquid hazardous materials that would apply during the transportation of the products or materials by any mode phmsa was prompted to do this via a petition for rulemaking submitted by the attorney general of the state of new york regarding vapor pressure standards for the transportation of crude oil the petition requests that phmsa implement a reid vapor pressure rvp limit less than 9 0 pounds per square inch psi for crude oil transported by rail on january 18 2017 phmsa issued an anprm in response to the petition after several extensions comments were due by may 19 2017 82 fed reg 5499 phmsa will use the comments submitted in response to this anprm to help assess and respond to the petition and to evaluate any other potential regulatory actions related to sampling and testing of crude oil and other class 3 hazardous materials phmsa will also evaluate the potential safety benefits and costs of utilizing vapor pressure thresholds within the hazardous materials classification process for unrefined petroleum based products and class 3 hazardous materials 1 2 transportation of lithium batteries by air lithium batteries are found in virtually every commercial aircraft that flies in the u s airspace they are found in everything from laptops cellphones ipods wheelchairs and other devices if not properly packaged and transported they can and have caused fires on board commercial aircraft phmsa is thus developing a rule amending the hmrs applicable to the transport of lithium cells and batteries by aircraft the rule is likely to contain three amendments a ban on the transport of lithium ion cells and batteries as cargo on passenger aircraft a requirement that lithium ion cells and batteries be shipped at not more than a 30 percent state of charge aboard cargo only aircraft and limits on the use of alternative provisions for small lithium cell or battery shipments to one package per consignment or overpack phmsa believes the rule is necessary to address an immediate safety hazard and harmonize the hmrs with emergency amendments to the 2015 2016 edition of the international civil aviation organization s technical instructions for the safe transport of dangerous goods by air icao technical instructions 1 3 conversion of special permits phmsa will continue to convert special permits into the text of the hmrs specifically as mandated by sections 33012 c and d of the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act map 21 phmsa will amend the hmrs to adopt provisions contained in certain widely used or long standing special permits that have an established safety record this rulemaking action is intended to provide wider access to the regulatory flexibility offered in special permits and eliminate the need for numerous renewal requests the rulemaking action will also reduce paperwork burdens and facilitate commerce while maintaining an appropriate level of safety phmsa conducted an extensive analysis of active special permits approvals and related petitions and those deemed suitable will be adopted into the hmr 1 4 international standards harmonization phmsa is required by law to ensure that to the extent practicable regulations governing the transportation of hazardous materials in commerce are consistent with standards adopted by international authorities harmonization yields many benefits it enhances safety facilitates compliance and improves the efficiency of the global transportation system by minimizing the regulatory burden on the public thus promoting trade after a thorough review of the provisions recently adopted by various international regulatory bodies phmsa has identified areas in the hmr in which harmonization with international regulations will provide an enhanced level of safety an economic benefit or in many instances both increased safety and economic benefits as a result phmsa has proposed a rule issued november 27 2018 that amends the hmr where appropriate to maintain alignment with international standards and consequently facilitate the safe global trade of hazardous materials 83 fed reg 60970 proposals in this rulemaking action include but are not limited to non testing alternative methods for classifying corrosive materials a classification scheme and transport provisions for articles containing hazardous materials that do not already have a proper shipping name provisions to recognize one time movement approvals issued by transport canada and the incorporation by reference of various international standards including the latest editions of the un model regulations on the transport of dangerous goods the international maritime dangerous goods organization imdg code the icao technical instructions and the international organization for standardization iso technical standards applicable to cylinders comments are due by january 28 2019 1 5 research gaps and priorities to its credit phmsa has given significant attention to identifying perceived research gaps and prioritizing projects for research with an emphasis on risk identification and mitigation gaps identified by phmsa include risk analysis and perception hazards risks and mitigation data development modeling techniques systems approaches risk communication and perception and hazmat release consequences emerging materials and technologies batteries and emerging energy products automated and connected vehicles and technologies for safety and decision maker emergency planning and response guidance development education and training and communication tracking and detection materials and equipment testing hazardous material characterization and testing package lining and corrosion resistance and monitoring and inspection consistent with its identification of these research gaps phmsa has identified over 30 prioritized research projects these include development of an overarching structure for assessing and managing risks through the hazmat transportation supply chain understanding failure rates of new and reconditioned hazmat drums in transportation understanding the impact of recycled material content on failure rates of hazmat containers understanding and preparing for changes in lithium battery uses characteristics and commercial and non commercial transportation and testing methods and criteria for the classification of a material as a corrosive solid 1 6 conclusion and summary phmsa can be expected to continue to promulgate rules in compliance with its statutory mandates but it also recognizes the need to shore up gaps and to keep pace with an accelerating array of products that are transported in commerce new information and research will drive much of what phmsa undertakes in 2019 advances in technology enhanced commerce and a rapidly evolving global trade in hazardous materials must be matched by phmsa if it is to satisfy its mandates at this point phmsa appears to recognize these new challenges and is poised to maintain its highly honed edge on hazardous materials transportation h trade 1 introduction b c s and acta s clients manufacture innovative and essential products that span all sectors of the economy and that are distributed across the globe but the efficacy of these products

that have taken the spotlight over the past year and that loom large for 2019 a bedrock platform of donald trump s presidential campaign was his promise to take actions on trade that he believes will disclose unfair practices he also promised to promote free fair and reciprocal trade and strongly enforce u s trade laws when mr trump accepted the republican nomination for president in cleveland in july 2016 he avowed that o longer will we enter into these massive deals with many countries that are thousands of pages long and which no one from our country even reads or understands we are going to enforce all trade violations including through the use of taxes and tariffs against any country that cheats mr trump promised to take several unilateral actions he stated he would punish china and other cheaters with crippling tariffs calling the north american free trade agreement nafta the worst deal ever he vowed to dismantle it decrying multi lateral trade agreements mr trump claimed that he would withdraw from the trans pacific partnership tpp cease negotiations on the transatlantic trade and investment partnership t tip and focus instead on securing bilateral agreements president trump threatened to take actions on specific products to protect american workers and industry even if that meant imposing restrictions on our closest trading partners and he promptly did so on march 8 2018 he issued two proclamations that imposed a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a ten percent tariff on imported aluminum the president claimed the tariffs were necessary for national security justifications citing section 232 of the trade act of 1974 trade act pub l no 93 618 the tariffs impacted canada mexico the eu and other close trading partners the president eventually suspended the duties against canada and mexico citing on going nafta discussions and doc subsequently promulgated procedures for excluding products from the tariffs but these exclusions only apply to individuals or organizations using steel or aluminum articles identified in the proclamations nonetheless the bell in the ring had been clanged it was clear that president trump intended to follow through on his promises regarding trade mr trump has made good on his promises and more since taking office the president has taken scores of actions on trade issues often unprecedented actions that at times unsettled global financial markets and 2019 promises to be equally as turbulent the president will no doubt continue to advance his america first trade agenda and that is a recipe for more uncertainty and angst for any company that trades outside the u s prognosticating on what specifically may occur in the next year is made even more difficult by the fact that the president and his staff often telegraph conflicting messages on trade at the g20 summit in december however president trump and chinese president xi jinping did reach an agreement of sorts on trade issues and agreed to begin 90 days of negotiations on trade issues b c will soon be releasing a podcast on trade issues as part of its all things chemical series available on itunes spotify stitcher and google play music please stay tuned 2 pillars of u s trade policy president trump has launched a new era in american trade policy his agenda is driven by a determination to use the leverage available to the world s largest economy to obtain fairer treatment for american workers this policy rests on the following five major pillars trade policy that supports national security policy strengthening the american economy negotiating trade deals that work for all americans enforcing and defending u s trade laws and strengthening the multilateral trading system 2 1 trade policy that supports national security policy consistent with the national security strategy president trump announced in december 2017 the president s trade policy recognizes that economic prosperity at home is necessary for american power and influence abroad free fair and reciprocal trade relations are a key component of the president s strategy to promote american prosperity therefore the trump administration is working and will continue to work aggressively to address trade imbalances promote fair and reciprocal trade relationships enforce u s rights under existing trade agreements and work with like minded countries to defend our common prosperity and security against economic aggression the president s trade policy agenda states ountries that are committed to market based outcomes and that are willing to provide the united states with reciprocal opportunities in their home markets will find a true friend and ally in the trump administration in 2019 the u s will continue to take steps to protect its national interests against hostile policies imposed by china russia or any other countries the united states will respond to unfair economic competitors by using all available tools to discourage any country from undermining true fair market competition 2 2 strengthening the american economy the president s trade agenda seeks to build on the economic momentum provided by the tax cuts and jobs act passed in december 2017 and the administration s efforts to reduce regulatory burdens the trump administration believes that its focus on fair and reciprocal trade combined with the president s tax cuts and regulatory relief will lead to more efficient markets and make it easier for american workers and companies to succeed 2 3 negotiating trade deals that work for all americans the trump administration will seek an extension of trade promotion authority until 2021 and aggressively use that authority to negotiate or revise trade agreements so they are fair and balanced and support american prosperity the trump administration intends to reach other agreements designed to promote fair balanced trade and support american prosperity as part of this effort the u s and the uk established a trade and investment working group to lay the groundwork for commercial continuity and prepare for a potential future trade agreement once the uk leaves the eu the administration will continue preparing for other potential bilateral agreements including in the indo pacific and african regions 2 4 enforcing and defending u s trade laws the trump administration is committed to using all tools available under u s law to combat unfair trade for example in january 2018 president trump exercised his authority under section 201 of the trade act to provide safeguard relief to u s manufacturers injured by imports of washing machines and solar panels this was the first time section 201 had been used to impose tariffs in 16 years in 2017 the trump administration launched a self initiated section 301 investigation with an in depth probe into chinese practices related to forced technology transfer unfair licensing and ip policies and practices more discussion on this investigation is below the trump administration has successfully litigated a number of world trade organization wto disputes helping force countries to abandon unfair practices and preserving the u s right to enact fair laws 2 5 strengthening the multilateral trading system president trump is no fan of the wto he claims that the wto is not operating as the contracting parties envisioned and as a result is undermining america s ability to act in its national interest the trump administration will work with like minded countries to address these concerns 3 u s china trade dispute the entire world is worried deem it a war battle skirmish or whatever military confrontation moniker you choose there is little doubt that president trump is pursuing an aggressive and retaliatory assault on china for what the administration believes are unfair trade practices and an indefensible trade deficit with the second largest economy on the planet and china is punching back the president s ire towards china s trade practices are not likely to abate he has stated that china is one of the chief violators of unfair trade practices the u s and china are and in 2019 likely will continue to be engaged in a tit for tat trade and tariff confrontation as the two countries battle for superiority in asia although president trump has stated that he is confident he can reach an agreement with china at the g20 summit consider this for the first time in 29 years the asia pacific economic cooperation summit concluded on november 18 2018 with officials failing to issue a joint closing statement the 21 countries at the summit represent 60 percent of the world economy the day before the summit closed vice president mike pence and chinese president jinping criticized each other in speeches adding to the tension and uncertainty over whether the u s and china can resolve their trade disputes press accounts paint the meeting in papua new guinea as acrimonious highlighting widening divisions between china and the u s the holdup was that the u s and china could not reach common ground on language over trade draft versions of the communique showed the u s wanted strong language against unfair trade practices that it claims china practices china wanted a reaffirmation of opposition to protectionism and unilateralism that it says are hallmarks of the u s trade strategy the spat seems to have boiled down to one sentence in the draft joint closing statement e agreed to fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices china reportedly objected to that sentence as it is accused by the u s as the main culprit of protectionism and unfair trade practices that disagreement is a small slice of the growing rivalry between the world s two biggest economies perhaps papua new guinea prime minister peter o neill who hosted the summit summed it up best when at the end of the summit he told reporters he entire world is worried president trump s actions towards china began soon after he took office in august 2017 he issued a memorandum directing the u s trade representative ustr to determine if china s policies regarding ip theft and forced technology requirements may be harming american rights innovation or technology development and thus warrant ustr action under section 301 of the trade act following the memorandum on august 18 2017 the ustr initiated an investigation under section 301 of the trade act into china s acts policies and practices related to technology transfer ip and innovation 82 fed reg 40213 aug 24 2017 then in january 2018 the ustr submitted to congress its annual report on china s wto compliance the report states that it seems clear that the united states erred in supporting china s entry into the wto on terms that have proven to be ineffective in securing china s embrace of an open market orientated trade regime it was not until march 2018 however that things really started heating up on march 22 2018 the ustr released its report among other things it found that china uses joint venture requirements foreign investment restrictions and administrative review and licensing processes to force or pressure technology transfers from american companies uses discriminatory licensing processes to transfer technologies from u s companies to chinese companies directs and facilitates investments and acquisitions that generate large scale technology transfer and conducts and supports cyber intrusions into u s computer networks to gain access to valuable business information taken in sum the ustr and an interagency team of subject matter experts and economists estimated that china s policies result in harm to the u s economy of at least 50 billion per year president trump swiftly took action in april he proposed to impose a tariff of 25 percent on 50 billion worth of imported chinese goods he eventually culled this list in june down to 34 billion worth of goods in july however trump struck china again imposing a 25 percent tariff on some 16 billion worth of chinese imports and in july he dropped the hammer setting a ten percent tariff on 200 billion worth of imported chinese products that tariff is slated to increase to 25 percent in january 2019 unless the u s and china can reach an agreement in short at this time virtually every item imported from china is subject to additional tariffs china of course has retaliated and imposed its own tariffs on goods from the u s adding to the tensions on november 20 2018 the ustr updated its section 301 report on china the ustr found that the tariffs and other actions imposed by the u s have not deterred china s practices and that china denies its practices are unfair or illegal the ustr s findings are likely to inspire further action by the trump administration at the g20 summit president trump and president jinping called a 90 day truce on raising tariffs and agreed to begin negotiations on trade ustr robert lighthizer considered a trade hawk is leading the negotiations the deadline for the negotiations is march 1 2019 and mr lighthizer has stated that is a hard deadline he has also stated that the president wants china to implement trade practices that protect u s technology and ip and increase market access for american companies if that can be done the president wants us to do it if not we ll have tariffs he stated specifying how the u s will increase tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese goods from ten percent to 25 percent if a deal hasn t been struck by march 1 2019 trump could also impose tariffs on 267 billion in additional chinese goods it remains to be seen whether president trump author of the art of the deal can strike an accord with china on trade issues tensions between the two nations are high what is certain is that the continued trade spat will upset global financial markets and supply chains and breed festering uncertainty for u s companies that trade with china 4 renegotiating nafta candidate trump loved to rail against nafta and vowed that he would dismantle and renegotiate it in a manner that yields better returns for the u s against its north american neighbors he did exactly that after he was sworn in in may 2017 as the ustr mr lighthizer said that the u s was going to renegotiate nafta three days after taking office mr lighthizer formally notified congress as required under the trade act that the u s intended to renegotiate nafta the purpose of the renegotiation would be to support higher paying jobs in the u s and to grow the u s economy by improving u s opportunities to trade with canada and mexico the notification stated that the renegotiation will address chapters in nafta that are outdated and do not reflect modern standards specific trade agendas that the negotiation may address include digital trade ip rights protection regulatory practices state owned enterprises services customs procedures sanitary and phytosanitary sps measures small and medium sized enterprises as well as labor and environmental standards canada however was at least in the eyes of the white house slow to get on board with the negotiations president trump thus decided to move ahead and negotiate with mexico in august 2018 the u s and mexico announced that they had reached a preliminary agreement in principle to update nafta the swiftness with which the u s and mexico were reaching agreement forced canada to participate more directly in the negotiations the negotiations ended on september 30 2018 when the u s mexico and canada reached agreement on the revamped accord now dubbed the united states mexico canada agreement usmca the agreement is more of a modification to nafta than a complete rewrite of it according to administration officials usmca will include new provisions on textiles that incentivize greater north american production in textiles and apparel trade strengthen customs enforcement and facilitate broader consultation and cooperation among the parties more specifically usmca will promote greater use of made in the usa fibers yarns and fabrics reviews from industry and others on the renegotiated trade pact garnered positive initial reviews it is believed that the usmca will include increased labor protections for workers increased standards for duty free auto shipments increased access to the canadian dairy market for u s farmers and improvements to the dispute resolution system stocks surged after the trade deal was announced implementation of the usmca is underway the devil is in the details however whether the revised agreement lives up to its promises is yet to be seen but it appears to be a positive step in leveling the playing field for north american trade 5 abandoning multi lateral trade agreements president trump wasted little time in following up on his vow to scuttle multi lateral trade agreements just three days after taking office on january 23 2017 president trump announced the withdrawal of the u s from the tpp negotiations and agreement in making the announcement he stated that it is the policy of my administration to represent the american people and their financial well being in all negotations particularly the american worker and to create fair and economically beneficial trade deals that serve their interests he further added that it is his intention to abandon multilateral trade deals and instead deal directly with individual countries on a one on one basis in negotiating future trade deals similarly the u s abandoned the multi year negotiations with the eu on the t tip accord in place of these multilateral agreements the president has forged ahead with his intent to ink bilateral agreements on october 16 2018 trump formally notified congress that the u s has launched negotiations with the uk on a trade accord his announcement has received immediate and high praise from many in congress and the business community the ustr has also begun trade negotiations with several other nations
the euro is a survivor the new currency brought into being on january 1st 1999 has defied early critics who thought it doomed to failure it has emerged from its turbulent teenage years intact cheating a near death experience the debt crisis of 2009 12 it is now more popular than ever with the public but fundamental tensions attended its birth although the euro has made it this far they still hang over it if europe s single currency is to survive a global slowdown or another crisis it will require a remodelling that politicians seem unwilling or unable to press through to its supporters the bold economic experiment was the culmination of half a century of european co operation and a crucial step towards an ever closer union that would unite a continent once riven by conflict nations with a common currency never went to war against each other said helmut kohl germany s chancellor who together with france s president françois mitterrand championed monetary union in the 1990s to cement deeper political and economic integration why a monetary union each member brought its own hopes and fears to the union to the french it was a way of taming the economic might of a newly reunified germany and the power of the bundesbank to the germans who feared they would eventually foot the bill for profligate southerners the prize was a stable currency and an end to competitive devaluations by italy to the italians greeks and other southerners monetary union was a means of borrowing the inflation fighting credibility of the bundesbank on which the european central bank ecb was modelled the most vocal critics of the euro many in america saw a foolhardy plan crafted by naive politicians the currency union would shackle together economies that were too different in structure while taking away a weapon to fight asymmetric downturns that hit individual members such as a local housing bust by giving up the ability to devalue currencies the only way to adjust would be through painful and politically troublesome cuts to real wages unlike america which also shares a monetary union there would be no federal budget to help stabilise demand across state borders milton friedman gave the euro no more than ten years before it collapsed and took the eu with it the world s second largest economy neither its staunchest advocates nor its harshest critics have proved correct the currency area has grown to 19 countries and ranks as the world s second largest economy when measured using market exchange rates behind only america but the euro has only muddled through political will particularly at its franco german core meant that just enough was done to ensure that the euro survived the debt crisis but none of the union s fundamental problems was solved as it enters its third decade the question is whether the currency can withstand the next upheaval to do so will require the right economic tools to overcome the euro area s weaknesses these became obvious after debt crises engulfed greece then ireland portugal and spain the unresolved conflicts of the past 20 years has meant too little integration and too little reform crucial gaps in its structure are yet to be fixed and its ammunition is limited at the same time europe is politically more divided in many countries mainstream leaders are succumbing to populists divisions have widened between the fiscally disciplined north and the south which advocates redistribution across borders the deeper cross border integration of economies banks and capital markets that would alleviate domestic economic difficulties has not materialised the euro s architects hoped that deeper integration would make the pain of real wage adjustment easier to bear but the external discipline of a single currency has not as hoped forced governments to undertake much reform to labour and product markets to improve competitiveness and so bring economies into line members trade more with each other but compared with grand expectations the gains have been modest labour mobility is still low financial integration has been limited too in america capital and credit flowing from the rest of the country cushion the impact of a downturn in any one state but a single capital market has not fully developed in the euro area according to the oecd a rich country club the corporate bond market amounts to a tenth of gdp compared with over two fifths in america a study by the european commission in 2016 found that integration of capital and labour markets helped to cushion the blow of half of asymmetric shocks in america but only a tenth in the euro area no sense of togetherness what banking integration has occurred has amplified risks not spread them banks have done little direct lending to firms and households across euro area borders lending in the 2000s was of the flighty interbank sort that could easily be withdrawn this fed macroeconomic imbalances net foreign liabilities in portugal greece and spain rose to 80 per cent or more of gdp by 2008 but capital fled swiftly once the global financial crisis got underway foreign debts suddenly could not be rolled over and crisis erupted without deep integration the burden of adjustment falls on member states that are already stricken greece was engulfed by crisis after it overspent and hid its fiscal deficits the crisis spread to ireland poleaxed by reckless banks and spain which suffered a property bust matters were made worse in an infernal loop of doom as governments struggled to borrow enough to support failing banks while banks were beset by the tumbling value of the government debt they held greece ireland portugal spain and cyprus needed bail outs in return northern countries insisted on stringent austerity measures and onerous structural reforms the euro area has become more balanced economically as a result of these measures gaps in competitiveness that ballooned during the first decade of the currency s existence have since narrowed as wages have been slashed and collective bargaining practices reformed in southern states almost every country apart from france estonia and spain is now running a primary fiscal surplus ie before interest payments ireland portugal and spain ran current account deficits before the crisis but are now running surpluses vulnerable nevertheless as the euro area enters its third decade it is still vulnerable to another downturn and underlying tensions are unresolved if not sharpened past imbalances have left large debts that are only slowly being chipped away greece portugal and spain have big external debts see chart 1 fiscal firepower is limited seven countries have public debt around or over 100 per cent of gdp see chart 2 the euro area has no budget of its own to soften the blow the wider eu has one but it is small at 0 9 per cent of gdp and is not intended to provide stimulus as fiscal policy provided too little stimulus when it was required the ecb bore the burden in 2015 after much delay it began a programme of quantitative easing its purchases of securities such as government bonds from banks eventually encouraged more lending and kick started recovery even that took a fight german horror of monetising debt led the ecb to to set limits on the amount of a country s debt it could own even so german critics launched legal complaints that the bank was breaking eu law by monetising debt it was only in december 2018 that the european court of justice ruled that the scheme was legal thanks in part to its ownership limits the bank s ability to provide stimulus in the next downturn will be constrained short term interest rates are already negative the bank s balance sheet of 4 5trn 4trn is vast and holdings of german sovereign bonds are already nearing its ownership limit of 33 per cent it will take years before interest rates let alone the balance sheet return to normal should a recession strike before then the bank will have to rethink its toolkit morgan stanley a bank puts the ecb s firepower at 1 5trn if it increases its ownership limit of sovereign bonds to 50 per cent and widens its private sector asset purchases to include bank bonds but such a redesign could be difficult increasing holdings of sovereign debt would risk dividing the bank s governing council and provoking fresh legal challenge by critics in 2012 mario draghi the ecb s president said he would do whatever it takes to save the euro committing to buy unlimited amounts of government bonds if sovereigns hit trouble but the bank s governing council may be split when it comes to putting such a scheme into practice jens weidmann the bundesbank s chief and a contender to become the next leader of the ecb has opposed it northerners still fear paying profligate southerners bills either through debt monetisation or bail outs for the germans and the more hawkish new hanseatic league a group of eight small northern members the debt crisis highlighted the importance of a national discipline that they fear is still lacking in the south if the euro s past is a guide change only happens during a crisis southern discomfort at the same time southerners feel they are bearing all the pain of recovery the politics of monetary union is more febrile as a result after eight years of eye watering austerity greek gdp per person is still far below its level in 2007 in real terms see chart 3 in 2015 syriza a left wing party came to power promising to end austerity before spectacularly reversing course when it became clear that greece needed a third bail out the hope that lawmakers in italy would be forced into making growth enhancing reforms has been dashed the economy was limping even before currency union public debt is a daunting 130 per cent of gdp income per head in real terms is no different than in 1999 the stagnation raises the question of whether italy can grow within the euro area says jeromin zettelmeyer from the peterson institute for international economics and the eu has become the italian government s external enemy in june 2018 a populist coalition took office seeking to overturn pension reforms and promising to increase public spending provoking a stand off with brussels before italy backed down in december after the previous crisis politicians struggled to cope their successors are even less well equipped or less well intentioned political developments both within the euro area and without could restrain the economic response to the next downturn and are holding back much needed institutional reform emergency action was taken during the debt crisis a sovereign bail out fund was cobbled together for instance such steps had been urged by the imf and america s president barack obama the federal reserve helped to provide dollar liquidity similar engagement or encouragement is unlikely while donald trump is in the white house political differences between the north and south mean that three institutional flaws remain unresolved private sector risk sharing through banks and capital markets is insufficient the doom loop connecting banks and sovereigns has not been fully severed and there is no avenue for fiscal stimulus don t bank on it europe s banks like those across the atlantic have improved their liquidity and capital positions since the financial crisis the total amount of bad loans although still high in greece and italy is falling in 2012 the euro area introduced reforms to create a banking union in order to integrate national systems and loosen the ties between banks and sovereigns big banks are now supervised by a central authority and a resolution fund is responsible for winding down failing banks so that national governments are not as exposed to big ones that collapse lenders remain stubbornly national however branches and subsidiaries that operate across borders make up only a tenth of the euro area banking sector s assets banks cannot use deposits in one country to lend in another because national regulators do not want to be on the hook for loans to improvident foreigners an eu wide deposit guarantee scheme would allay that fear but has yet to be agreed at a meeting of heads of state on 14 december a discussion of the scheme first proposed in 2012 was kicked further into the long grass fiscal hawks insist that banks bring down non performing loans before risks are shared across countries political differences have also prevented the doom loop from being broken fully a side effect of stricter rules on banks capital which deems sovereign debt as riskless is that banks have loaded up on it big banks in italy portugal and spain hold around 8 10 per cent of their assets in these bonds jitters about the sustainability of a country s debt could worsen banks balance sheets translating into fears about their solvency but limits on banks sovereign exposures backed by northerners were not even discussed in december highly indebted italians detest limits fearing the loss of a steady source of demand for their debt and a rise in borrowing costs fiscal policy is another political battleground it is meant to be a matter for member states but to avoid imbalances building up they are required to obey the eu s rules which include running fiscal deficits of less than 3 per cent and public debt below 60 per cent of gdp that has led to clashes between the european commission which polices the rules and is backed by hawks and other national governments which want to enact stimulus or deliver on election promises some economists think that national fiscal policy alone is insufficient particularly if countries that most need stimulus are constrained by fears of provoking bond markets country level rules cannot force the miserly or the better off to spend more for the good of the currency area in 2017 emmanuel macron france s president proposed a euro area budget to help stabilise demand in countries hit by an asymmetric downturn but northern hawks see little need for such a function for them national public finances suffice a heavily watered down version of mr macron s budget proposal was agreed in december but rather than drawing on new funds it will sit within the existing eu budget and focus on convergence and competition rather than stabilising demand the prospects for meaningful change may seem bleak but it could still happen thinks daniele antonucci of morgan stanley he reckons that investors are too pessimistic about reform and that there is a chance that the bloc will enact a euro area budget with a stabilisation function over the next ten years mr macron s budget proposal was considered taboo only a year ago he says now that a version has been agreed it leaves scope for expansion never let a crisis go to waste if the euro s past is a guide change only happens during a crisis the previous one revealed a willingness of the franco german core to save the euro at any cost that willingness remains and cannot be underestimated laurence boone of the oecd who was an adviser to françois hollande mr macron s predecessor thinks that the eu budget already contains tools such as cohesion and investment funds that could be enlarged and repurposed to stabilise the euro area if it hit trouble the euro s public popularity should help as should the quietening of calls for leaving the euro in countries where it once seemed possible parties that flirted with exit such as the front national in france and the northern league in italy now seek change from within britain s agonising brexit drama may have served as a warning other events though could easily conspire against immediate action mr macron has been weakened his recent concessions to gilets jaunes protesters means that france will probably violate european fiscal rules angela merkel germany s chancellor who led the euro area s emergency response during the crisis is due to step down in 2021 reform minded european officials such as mr draghi depart this year if crisis engulfs italy the bloc s third largest member even franco german determination to save the euro may not be enough political fragmentation means there is no guarantee that the next crisis will deliver the leap in integration needed to keep the euro safe the economics of currency union was always going to be hard for politicians to manage in its first 20 years they did enough to keep the euro alive the next 20 years will be less forgiving a crisis will inevitably strike and if politicians do not see through reform they may well oversee the euro s demise 2019 the

whatâ s next for the us dollar gold stocks bonds the quip if you aren t confused you aren t paying attention needs to be replaced with the fed confused you better pay attention you may want to buckle up let me explain it all starts with the fed in assessing our crystal ball for 2019 the starting point is the federal reserve fed because they provide an anchor for the price of risk free assets treasuries around which risk assets are priced 1 when rates were near zero and the fed purchased treasuries it wasn t only treasury yields that were depressed but the fed pulled down yields of risk assets as well differently said the fed made it appear as if risky assets were less risky this didn t only affect bonds but also equities that enjoyed years of rising prices on the backdrop of low volatility this was the era of compressed risk premia part of the rise in risk premia in 2018 was a direct result of rates moving higher that said volatility has come back with a vengeance historically in our analysis an extended period of low volatility remember the goldilocks years ahead of the financial crisis is often followed by an extraordinary surge in volatility as such to an extent the elevated volatility we see now is to be expected possibly it is also related to algorithms dominating some markets and or geo political events but could it be that the fed s transition from fomc to fofc has something to do with it fomc becoming fofc the federal reserve open market committee fomc is the body that under the leadership of its chair jay powell sets the federal funds rate the fofc in contrast is the flip or flop committee the fofc appears to be a secret body as i have yet to see any announcement that it has formally been established yet judging from fed chair jay powell s comments in recent weeks it may have displaced the fomc joking aside the fed had been on a set course to let its large treasury holdings run off engage in so called quantitative tightening or qt and to raise rates until last summer powell had made it clear that even with the higher rates the fed was still accommodative in december after the 4th 0 25 rate hike of 2018 the fomc statement stated that the interest rates had now reached what some at the fed considered to be neutral implying rates would need to move higher especially since he had indicated a few months earlier that rates may need to move above neutral he had also suggested not to touch the qt program so as to not to confuse the markets with multiple policy tools fast forward and it s a different story in a recent panel discussion powell implied the path of quantitative tightening is not set in stone and the fed would be flexible similarly powell suggested the fed can be very flexible even lower rates on short notice should it be required what behind the scenes in the markets the key thing that had changed is that some markets have thrown a tantrum notably the equity markets also while the fed talked about raising rates the markets wanted to hear none of that pricing in ever fewer rate hikes for 2019 as 2018 was winding down after powell s comments about being willing to reverse course the markets even priced in a decline in interest rates for later this year the tantrum didn t start in a vacuum earlier last year some emerging market currencies fell sharply versus the dollar such stress is not uncommon as many businesses in emerging markets get their funding in u s dollar where the cost of borrowing is lower during good times however during bad times local currencies suffer causing strain on those borrowers to service their debt as the year progressed there were signs of slowdowns in some international markets that said the fed is well aware that their mandate is not the well being of emerging markets even if some at the fed periodically point to the rest of the world more specifically if i may the whole point of raising rates is to tighten financial conditions and while the fed looks at a whole array of ways of how tight financial conditions are it s our understanding that one of the more relevant ones for the fed to gauge availability of credit is their senior loan officer opinion survey sloos and based on the sloos sure the wheels may be falling off somewhere in the world but in the u s lending standards have not substantially tightened basically the rearward looking fed can see that financial conditions are gradually tightening but had not reached all areas where it matters in the meantime the forward looking markets were suggesting at least according to common media interpretation that the slowdown is coming in earnest behind the scenes at the fed i ve pointed out that powell is an attorney not a ph d economist with that i m suggesting he does not have an academic agenda that i allege bernanke the student of the great depression and yellen the labor economist had instead i assess him as the type of person who will call a committee to make a decision suggesting he will be re active rather than pro active greenspan was known for going out on a limb making pro active decisions based on his projections powell is a different type of fed chair separately while the public has been told qt is on a steady path this hides the underlying unease at the fed where as to where qt should lead in my assessment of discussions at the fed there is a general consensus that the fed s balance sheet should be shrunk letting treasuries run off shrinks the fed s balance sheet but there was never consensus as to its exact size other than it should be larger than the pre crisis level amongst others but not only because there s more cash in circulation which is also part of the fed s balance sheet when yellen came up with the analogy that qt is akin to watching paint dry on a wall and the market bough it folks at the fed must have been thrilled that is the fed doesn t want qt to disrupt markets except now markets are having a fit and it is as yet unresolved exactly how small the fed balance sheet should be if i m not mistaken the fed thought they have until late 2019 to worry about when to halt qt well the paint on the wall has dried up and the market wants answers and the fed doesn t have an answer except that it is wading in a dark room that may be correct but isn t very helpful remember when you walk in a dark room even when you are careful you sometimes hit sharp objects the tail wagging the dog as i alluded to in the beginning the fed sets the benchmark for the risk free asset however imperfect that may be it s better to know what the fed is up it s worse not to know but it s truly bad if the fed is wavering based on the whims of the markets after powell flip flopped to suggest the fed could also be easing equity markets surged does that now mean all is dandy and the fed can resume tightening to put it gently powell is learning on the job while the news media loves to fit the storyline to what s happening in the market please consider the following based on cftc data speculators had been betting aggressively on higher rates through the third quarter of 2018 in many ways the change in rate expectations may well be a result of a short squeeze betting on higher rates requires shorting certain instruments that then took on a life on its own meaning just because the markets are moving doesn t always mean fundamentals are changing there s a reason the fed s institutional setup is to act slowly let s not forget why the fed wanted to raise rates in the first place it is because unemployment is at incredibly low levels while wage pressures are gradually rising incidentally powell has been increasingly shrugging off rising wage pressures suggesting they imply higher productivity while it is correct productivity has been rising ignoring higher wages is in my view irresponsible as it risks dislodging the market s tame inflation expectations based on my assessment of rising wage pressure by not taking away the punch bowl it may have to play catch up later on a somewhat related note while corporate america is complaining about slowing global growth and may well start complaining about wage pressures eroding their margins soon us consumers are doing just fine aside from very healthy retail numbers in december consumers continue to cope rather well with their debt even with a recent uptick in delinquencies in assessing the chart below keep in mind it reflects longer term moving averages implications as you might imagine my conclusion is that at the very least volatility is to remain elevated for all the reasons mentioned above exacerbated by the fed s lack of clear direction i agree with most observers that the economic cycle is nearing its end i disagree though that we are at a cliff about to crash more importantly given the tight labor market i believe inflationary pressures will continue to rise ultimately limiting the fed s maneuvering room as alluded to above it is perfectly compatible in my view that corporate america is suffering but that the economy won t fall into recession at least not yet as we are approaching the end of the economic expansion will king dollar be de throned in favor of a weaker dollar is an expectation of lower rates ahead especially given the run up in recent years that said as indicated earlier it is by no means assured we have reached the peak in the u s rate hiking cycle in my judgment though even as u s rates may be moving higher investors will increasingly focus on the eventual downturn added to that may be rising u s inflationary pressures that will tame real rates it s in this context also that the price of gold has done reasonably well despite rising rates as gold does not pay a dividend it competes with any real return available on cash late phases of an economic expansion are in our analysis often associated with rising inflation the challenges powell is faced with are really not new which may well be another attribute as to why some investors are buying gold i tend to point out another dimension diversification when rates are up risk assets face headwinds as their future cash flows get discounted more with volatility up valuations can be all over the place in contrast gold s lack of cash flow is a benefit in this context as there is no discounting of a cash flow clearly the price of gold has historically been volatile but our analysis shows it has had positive performance in each equity bear market since 1970 with the notable exception of the early 80s when then fed chair volcker raised real interest rates to very high levels if my crystal ball is correct the price of gold may break out further to the upside when we are closer to the end of the rate hiking cycle as recent history suggests though the time to diversify is ahead of the unfolding of actual events looking across the ocean it s noteworthy that the swedish riksbank one of the central banks with negative rates recently raised rates i mention this because the ecb is also mulling a rate hike later this year europe clearly doesn t act in a vacuum if your view is that the global economy falls off a cliff but i wouldn t underestimate the odds of an ecb rate hike if for no other reason than ecb chief draghi may want to tie up loose ends before retiring late this year it is also difficult to imagine someone more dovish to take draghi s role thus possibly causing an adjustment higher in the rate path all of this doesn t bode too well for equities that said historically bear markets tend to mostly coincide with recessions we happen to think we are not there yet but this doesn t mean investors shouldn t be cautious most investors have a certain risk tolerance with volatility elevated and years of a bull market in equities odds are their portfolios are riskier than they signed up for that s why we preached a long time ago already to diversify the time to diversify is not exactly at the peak of the markets as that s extremely difficult to time instead in our humble opinion managing risk consists of stress testing one s portfolio before the tide turns then taking initiatives nonetheless we spend considerable time seeking to identify the peak in the business cycle please see our research reports at merkinvestments com research not only is the peak in the business cycle an important reference point there may also be an opportunity to take advantage of what then may be interest rate cuts as historically speaking future rate cuts are not fully priced in at that stage you may reach out to us

global economic growth is projected to soften from a downwardly revised 3 percent in 2018 to 2 9 percent in 2019 amid rising downside risks to the outlook the world bank said on tuesday international trade and manufacturing activity have softened trade tensions remain elevated and some large emerging markets have experienced substantial financial market pressures growth among advanced economies is forecast to drop to 2 percent this year the january 2019 global economic prospects says slowing external demand rising borrowing costs and persistent policy uncertainties are expected to weigh on the outlook for emerging market and developing economies growth for this group is anticipated to hold steady at a weaker than expected 4 2 percent this year at the beginning of 2018 the global economy was firing on all cylinders but it lost speed during the year and the ride could get even bumpier in the year ahead said world bank chief executive officer kristalina georgieva as economic and financial headwinds intensify for emerging and developing countries the world s progress in reducing extreme poverty could be jeopardized to keep the momentum countries need to invest in people foster inclusive growth and build resilient societies the upswing in commodity exporters has stagnated while activity in commodity importers is decelerating per capita growth will be insufficient to narrow the income gap with advanced economies in about 35 percent of emerging market and developing economies in 2019 with the share increasing to 60 percent in countries affected by fragility conflict and violence further brake on activity a number of developments could act as a further brake on activity a sharper tightening in borrowing costs could depress capital inflows and lead to slower growth in many emerging market and developing economies past increases in public and private debt could heighten vulnerability to swings in financing conditions and market sentiment intensifying trade tensions could result in weaker global growth and disrupt globally interconnected value chains robust economic growth is essential to reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity said world bank group vice president for equitable growth finance and institutions ceyla pazarbasioglu as the outlook for the global economy has darkened strengthening contingency planning facilitating trade and improving access to finance will be crucial to navigate current uncertainties and invigorate growth analytical chapters address key current topics the informal sector accounts for about 70 percent of employment and 30 percent of gdp in emerging market and developing economies since it is associated with lower productivity and tax revenues and greater poverty and inequality this is symptomatic of opportunities lost reducing tax and regulatory burdens improving access to finance offering better education and public services and strengthening public revenue frameworks could level the playing field between formal and informal sectors debt vulnerabilities in low income countries are rising while borrowing has enabled many countries to tackle important development needs the median debt to gdp ratio of low income countries has climbed and the composition of debt has shifted toward more expensive market based sources of financing these economies should focus on mobilizing domestic resources strengthening debt and investment management practices and building more resilient macro fiscal frameworks sustaining historically low and stable inflation is not guaranteed in emerging market and developing economies cyclical pressures that have depressed inflation over the past decade are gradually dissipating the long term factors that have helped reduce inflation over the past five decades global trade and financial integration widespread adoption of robust monetary policy frameworks may lose momentum or reverse maintaining low global inflation may become as much of a challenge as achieving it policies aimed at softening the blow of global food price swings can have unintended consequences if implemented by many governments in uncoordinated fashion government interventions can provide short term relief but widespread actions are likely to exacerbate food price spikes with heaviest impact on the poor for example trade policies introduced during the 2010 11 food price spike may have accounted for more than one quarter of the increase in the world price of wheat and maize the 2010 11 food price spike tipped 8 3 million people almost 1 percent of the world s poor into poverty designing tax and social policies to level the playing field for formal and informal sectors as well as strengthening domestic revenue mobilization and debt management will be important priorities for policymakers to overcome the challenges associated with informality in developing economies said world bank prospects group director ayhan kose as the economic outlook dims

in the zocalo these people came to cheer the inauguration of andres manuel lopez obrador part of a crowd estimated at over a million david bacon nafta had been in effect for just a few months when ruben ruiz got a job at the itapsa factory in mexico city in the summer of 1994 itapsa made auto brakes for echlin a u s manufacturer later bought out by the huge dana aftermarket group in the factory asbestos dust from brake parts coated machines and people alike ruiz had hardly begun his first shift when a machine malfunctioned cutting four fingers from the hand of the man operating it it seemed clear to ruiz that things were very wrong so he went to a meeting to talk about organizing a union when itapsa managers got wind of the effort they began firing the organizers nevertheless many of the workers joined stimahcs an independent democratic union of metalworkers itapsa workers filed a petition for an election but then discovered that they already had a union a unit of the confederation of mexican workers ctm they d never seen the union contract in essence a protection contract which insulates the company from labor unrest the plant s hr manager told ruiz that echlin management in the u s said any worker organizing an independent union should be immediately fired he told me my name was on a list of those people ruiz recounted and i was discharged right there nevertheless there was a vote in september 1997 to decide which union workers wanted but before the election a state police agent drove a car filled with rifles into the plant two busloads of strangers arrived armed with clubs and copper rods during the voting workers were escorted by ctm functionaries past the club and rifle wielding strangers some workers were forcibly kept in a part of the factory to keep them from voting at the polling station employees were asked aloud which union they favored in front of management and ctm representatives stimahcs tried to get the election canceled but the government body administering it the conciliation and arbitration board jca went ahead even after thugs roughed up one of the independent union s organizers predictably stimahcs lost for 20 years the itapsa election has been a symbol of all that s gone wrong with mexico s labor law which provides protection on paper for workers seeking to organize but which has been routinely undermined by a succession of governments bent on using a low wage workforce to attract foreign investment dana corporation was just one beneficiary itapsa has been the norm not the exception in 2015 thousands of farm workers struck u s growers in baja california instead of recognizing their new independent union however growers signed protection contracts with the ctm which were certified by the local jca strikers were blacklisted later that year workers tried to register an independent union in four juarez factories some 120 workers making ink cartridges for lexmark were fired as were another 170 at adc commscope and many more at foxconn and eaton the labor board declined to reinstate the fired workers in juarez and baja following the pattern it had set at itapsa two decades earlier indeed the jncs have been key to the defeat of workers attempts to form democratic unions invariably protecting employers and corporate friendly unions the new mexican government headed by president andres manuel lopez obrador amlo says that s all over deputy secretary of labor in the new administration alfredo dominguez marrufo promises that after all these struggles we can finally get rid of the protection contract system we can make our unions democratic choose our own leaders and negotiate our own contracts this government will defend the freedom of workers to organize that right has existed in theory but we ve had a structure making it impossible this will change that could have a big impact on political life in mexico where corporate union leaders have had an inside track to political power and corruption it could change the dominating role u s corporations have played in the mexican economy and affect relations between workers in both countries most of all it would raise a standard of living for workers that lopez obrador has called among the lowest on the planet in his speech to the mexican congress during his december 1 inauguration the new president charged that 36 years of neoliberal economic reforms had lowered the purchasing power of mexico s minimum wage by 60 percent today on the border that wage comes to a little above 4 per day according to university of california professor harley shaiken the mexican government created an investment climate that depends on a vast number of low wage earners this climate gets all the government s attention while the consumer climate the ability of people to buy what they produce is sacrificed protecting corporations from demands for higher wages has made mexico a profitable place to do business big auto companies the world s major garment manufacturers the global high tech electronic assemblers all built huge plants to take advantage of mexico s neoliberal economic policies starting more than two decades before the negotiation of the north american free trade agreement that wild west climate for investors produced more than low wages however between 1988 and 1992 163 juarez children were born with anencephaly without brains an extremely rare disorder health critics charged that the defects were due to exposure to toxic chemicals in the factories or their toxic discharges the chilpancingo colonia below the mesa in tijuana where the battery plant of metales y derivados was located experienced the same plague as the companies came south the people came north during the neoliberal period we became the second country in the world with the highest migration lopez obrador charged they live and work in the united states 24 million mexicans they are sending 30 billion dollars a year to their families the greatest social benefit we receive from abroad in his six year campaign for office in which he spoke in practically every sizeable town in the country lopez obrador repeated what he later told the congress that only development to combat poverty and marginalization as has never been done in history would provide an alternative to migration we will put aside the neoliberal hypocrisy he announced those born poor will not be condemned to die poor we want migration to be optional not mandatory happy where they were born where their family members their customs and their cultures are in his speech lopez obrador criticized two other neoliberal articles of faith that privatization of the state owned section of the mexican economy would lead to economic growth and that pro corporate changes in its labor law would create jobs and higher incomes starting before nafta was passed mexican president carlos salinas de gortari rammed through the congress changes in the constitution s guarantees of land reform to make private land ownership easier many of the communal ejidos created in previous decades were dissolved and their lands sold to investors farmers became wage workers on land they d previously owned subsequent land reforms led to granting foreign mining companies concessions on over a third of mexico s territory allowing them to develop operations even in the face of local opposition prices on basic goods were decontrolled and government subsidies on food were cut back or ended altogether in 1998 the government dissolved conasupo a system of state run stores selling basic foodstuffs like tortillas and milk at subsidized low prices at the same time price supports for small corn growers were also ended as nafta allowed u s corporations to flood the mexican market with cheap subsidized imported corn millions of farmers were displaced no longer able to sell their corn at a price that paid for growing it mexico is the origin of corn that blessed plant lopez obrador noted bitterly and now we are the nation that imports the most corn in the world he announced that a conasupo like subsidized food production and distribution system would be reestablished privatization marked a 180 degree change in the direction of mexican economic policy after its 1910 20 revolution nationalists believed that to be truly independent mexico had to ensure its resources were controlled by mexicans and used for their benefit the route to this control was nationalization to stop the transfer of wealth out of the country and to set up an internal market in which what was produced in mexico would be sold there as well mexico therefore guaranteed rights to workers that u s unions and workers could only dream of severance pay was mandatory and workers had a right to profit sharing during legal strikes companies had to shut their doors until the dispute was resolved on paper the government acknowledged the right of all people to education and housing in return however mexican unions gave up autonomy and control of their own affairs the government registered unions and oversaw their internal processes and choice of leaders it never tolerated independent action by workers and unions outside its political structure when the government changed its basic economic policy using low wages to attract foreign investment and producing for the us market instead of for mexico the government could and did punish resistance severely under presidents salinas de gortari and zedillo 1988 2000 privatization reforms became a whirlwind among the companies and industries affected were the aeromexico airline the telephone company the petrochemical industry dependent on the state run oil company the sicartsa steel mill the railroad network many mexican mines and the operation of the country s ports the leader of the union at aeromexico was imprisoned after he refused to accept the company s privatization and the layoff of thousands of workers the head of one of the largest sections of the union for employees of the social security system imss also spent months in jail in 1995 for denouncing government plans to privatize the enormous federal pension and healthcare agency in 1991 the mexican army took over the port of veracruz disbanded the longshore union and installed three private contractors to load and unload ships hourly wages of veracruz longshoremen fell from about 7 00 to 1 00 even as productivity rose from 18 to over 40 shipping containers handled per hour when the sicartsa steel mill was privatized in 1992 wages were cut in half and 1500 of the mill s 5000 workers were laid off they were then rehired as temporary labor under 28 day contracts the mexican government sold the cananea and nacozari copper mines among the world s largest to german larrea s grupo mexico at a fraction of their book value in 1997 larrea bought the 4052 mile pacific north railroad in partnership with pennsylvania based union pacific workers throughout northern mexico mounted a series of rolling wildcat strikes over cuts in its workforce of 13 000 by more than half they lost thirteen mexican financiers became billionaires during the salinas administration and larrea was one of them grupo mexico forced cananea s miners union to go on strike in 2009 a conflict that is still unresolved after 65 miners were entombed by an explosion in grupo mexico s pasta de conchos coal mine in 2006 the union s president napoleon gomez urrutia was forced into exile in canada he d accused larrea of industrial homicide for giving up rescue efforts after only three days this october gomez urrutia was elected senator in sonora on the morena ticket lopez obrador s party in formation and finally returned from canada to take office the harshest privatization came in 2009 when president felipe calderon dissolved the state owned power and light company of central mexico in firing all its 44 000 workers calderon hoped to destroy one of mexico s oldest and most democratic unions the mexican electrical workers sme the company s operations were folded into the federal electricity commission private electrical generation was already permitted by salinas and zedillo and lopez obrador s immediate predecessor enrique peña nieto had set up plans for private power sale to consumers meanwhile the federal electricity commission itself was slated for elimination peña nieto pushed a constitutional reform through congress to reverse the guarantee of national ownership of both the oil and electrical industries far from increasing productivity and investment however the damage caused to the national energy sector during neoliberalism is so serious lopez obrador charged that we are not only the oil country that imports the most gasoline in the world but we are now buying crude oil to supply the only six refineries that barely survive humberto montes de oca foreign secretary of the sme union says the country is bankrupt before we can redistribute wealth we have to recover it we know the banks will act against reversing the energy reform along with the others we will all have to participate in order to defend any changes this new government tries to make the sme has established a cooperative and has regained control of seven power generation stations along with other property that formerly belonged to the old company the hallmark of neoliberalism is corruption lopez obrador charged privatization has been synonymous with corruption in mexico the robbery of the goods of the people and the riches of the nation has been a modus operandi in the last three decades the highest authorities have dedicated themselves to giving concessions to the territory and transferring companies and public goods even functions of the state to national and foreign individuals the government will no longer facilitate looting and will no longer be a committee in the service of a rapacious minority to date only one economic reform enacted by lopez obrador s predecessors has been repealed outright the education reform that mandated standardized testing for students and testing and firing of teachers themselves mexico s teachers have a long history of resistance and radical politics more than 100 teachers in the state of oaxaca alone were killed during their struggle over control of their union and in defense of the indigenous communities in which they lived years of massive teacher strikes against the government s education reform eventually led to a massacre in nochixtlan in june 2016 in which nine people were gunned down by federal and state police the disappearance and murder of 43 students from the ayotzinapa training school in september 2014 was also an indirect product of the corporate education reform program their school had a reputation for turning out radical teachers as do many rural training schools like it and their students came from some of the poorest families in the countryside claudio x gonzález guajardo cofounder of the televisa foundation and the mexicanos primeros corporate education reform lobby called such public schools a swarm of politics and shouting he demanded the government replace them with private institutions following lopez obrador s speech to the congress gonzalez tweeted trump style amlo against the free market against the energy reform a retrograde statist interventionist stagnant vision the markets will react negatively it will go very badly with us very badly a shame in his address lopez obrador had promised the so called education reform will be canceled the right to free education will be established in article 3 of the constitution at all levels of schooling and the government will never again offend teachers the disappearance of ayotzinapa s youth will be thoroughly investigated the truth will be known and those responsible will be punished in meetings with the democratic teachers caucus he also promised free elections in their union the largest in latin america eliminating the authoritarian group that has held power in the union for decades could shift the balance between the left and right in mexico s institutional politics despite the move against education reform most mexican unions do not expect the new government to reverse the privatizations that have already taken place at least not for the first three years of lopez obrador s six year term instead they have concentrated on winning a basic reform of mexico s labor law which has changed radically during the past two decades in may 2000 the world bank made a series of recommendations to the mexican administration an integral agenda of development for the new era the bank recommended rewriting mexico s constitution and federal labor law by eliminating its requirements that companies give workers permanent status after 90 days limit part time work and abide by the 40 hour week pay severance when they lay workers off and negotiate over the closure of factories the bank called for ending the law s ban on strikebreaking and its guarantees of job training health care and housing the recommendations were so extreme that even some employers condemned them president vicente fox embraced the proposal but it failed to pass the congress after further attempts however president felipe calderon did get a similar reform adopted in 2012 it allows companies to outsource or subcontract jobs which was previously banned it allows part time and temporary work and pay by the hour rather than the day workers now can be terminated without cause for their first six months on the job arturo alcalde one of mexico s most respected labor lawyer and past president of the national association of democratic lawyers called the reforms an open invitation to employers and a road to a paradise of firings as he predicted subcontracting proliferated with disastrous results in just one instance grupo mexico replaced strikers at the cananea mine by contracting out their jobs inexperienced replacements died in mine accidents and allowed a huge spill of toxic mine tailings into the sonora river contaminating communities and sickening residents according to benedicto martinez co president of the authentic labor front the union federation to which stimahcs belongs the motivation of the government assisted by corporate unions was to encourage the layoff of longtime employees who could be replaced by subcontracted workers there are companies now where all the workers are subcontracted who have no employees of their own at all the conditions are very low just slightly above the legal minimum and sometimes below last year under pressure from the european union which sought a free trade agreement with mexico the peña nieto administration had to agree to reform some of the pro corporate labor practices the government was forced to ratify convention 98 of the international labor organization guaranteeing freedom of association something the united states has not done peña nieto then got the mexican congress to pass a constitutional reform embodying these changes corporate unions like the ctm clearly feeling threatened by the reform introduced their own legislation in 2017 to nullify its effect they couldn t get it passed however as it became evident that lopez obrador would be elected the next president in martinez eyes the constitutional reform is the most advanced proposal that you could imagine it includes union democracy and the disappearance of the conciliation and arbitration boards which have always been complicit with the bosses and the corporate unions in some states a union contract is treated like a state secret that no one is allowed to see martinez believes the reform was the fruit of many years of groups like his fighting the government it was like talking to a wall he recalls we were accused of being traitors to the country because we organized international pressure with unions all over the world denouncing the practices here in mexico domingues marrufo lopez obrador s deputy labor secretary agrees if it were not for that support from the u s and canadian united steelworkers and other unions it would have been impossible to achieve the constitutional reform but changing the constitution does not change the particular laws that govern labor activity implementing legislation must be passed to define rights and procedures and set up the structure for enforcing the reform after lopez obrador won the election in july but before he took office in december mexican unions and labor lawyers set up a discussion group the citizens labor observatory and debated how far the new changes should go some wanted to undo calderon s 2012 reform completely by reversing for instance the reform laws that now allow subcontracting and temporary employment in the end though the consensus among the democratic unions was to limit the proposal to the implementing legislation that gives workers the right to vote for the union and union leaders of their choice and to approve their contracts it was clear this was lopez obrador s favored choice as mexico city mayor in 2000 he had appointed another dean of mexican labor lawyers jesus campos linas as head of the city s labor board campos linas then made public an estimated 70 80 000 protection contracts whose contents had never been released to the workers they covered two days before christmas deputies from lopez obrador s morena party in formation introduced their labor reform bill into the chamber of deputies it will abolish the jcas and substitute an independent system of labor tribunals unions will be independent of the government and business and leaders must be elected by a majority of the workers union contracts will be public and must be ratified by the majority of the workers in a free and secret vote sweeping though it will be the new labor law is just a beginning on taking office lopez obrador appointed maria luisa alcalde the new labor secretary she is a former legislator daughter of labor lawyer arturo alcalde and at 31 the youngest person in amlo s cabinet she is very clear that the democratization of the unions will create a new situation and our society will have a much better chance to raise living standards dominguez says but he warned we aren t accustomed to organizing ourselves we re used to waiting for some powerful person to come from above to help us and while waiting for unions and workers to use the new law the government is still faced with many legacy strikes and fights inherited from 36 years of neoliberal administrations the telecommunications reform for instance mandated the breakup of telmex the old telephone monopoly sold to billionaire carlos slim in february it is set to be divided in two a move the telephone workers union bitterly opposes they are threatening to strike if it isn t stopped in the mid 1990s the telefonistas together with the authentic labor front fat and two other unions formed the national union of workers an independent labor federation they supported lopez obrador very strongly our corporate elite had to respond to the fact that the vast majority of mexicans voted for him and were unable to use their electoral fraud strategy to deny him victory as they had in the past says victor enrique fabela vice president of the union but he doesn t believe that lopez obrador will simply do what unions ask pointing out that the new president invited carlos slim to hear his inaugural speech to the congress an invitation not extended to the union s general secretary francisco hernandez juarez further long term operating concessions have been renewed for televisa and teleazteca two media giants with a record of rightwing politics we have to be critical he cautioned while understanding that we have to support the direction amlo is moving the strike in cananea has yet to be settled and there and in nacozari two of the world s largest copper mines the miners union was forced out by previous jca decisions favoring the ctm and grupo mexico the communities on the rio sonora are still suffering the health effects of the toxic spill three years later and on november 29 at the giant pkc wire harness plant in ciudad acuña just two days before lopez obrador was sworn in ctm thugs marched into the facility shouting mineros afuera as workers were about to vote on the miners union as their representative they overturned ballot boxes the election was canceled and the mineros say its representatives were beaten we all want a change charged moises acuña the mineros political secretary we have a chance to move forward now and we have to use it meanwhile a new federation of independent unions in the auto industry has also been formed and plans to fight with the ctm over the right to negotiate contracts with the industry s giants in dealing with the workers upsurge and the emergence of new unions however lopez obrador s government faces a complex situation the jcas will disappear and the new tribunals will be formed but there are no judges yet and they won t be in place for the first three years the tribunals have to be funded and judges and personnel trained in administering a completely new law but during that time in order to represent workers and negotiate a union still has to be certified by the authorities martinez says there must be some way to ensure that the workers have approved this union and this approval must take place before any negotiation begins plus who are the inspectors now responsible for investigating the outsourcing to make sure it s legal we need an army of them and there s no money to hire them despite the institutional challenges dominguez believes that the time has arrived when mexican workers may be able to reshape their nation today many workers live in poverty on one or two dollars a day this is the fundamental problem but we re not just fighting for an economic goal not just for decent wages but for the revitalization of the democratic life of workers of our unions and the organizations we belong to
by david ljunggren ottawa reuters the bank of canada held interest rates steady as expected on wednesday but said more increases would be necessary even though low oil prices and a weak housing market will harm the economy in the short term governor stephen poloz said the challenges were temporary and he still believed the economy would at some stage be operating at full capacity with inflation on target and with interest rates in a zone where they are no longer stimulating or contracting aggregate demand the bank has raised rates five times since july 2017 and as recently as last month said the pace of tightening could be sped up depending on economic data but on wednesday it said rates would need to rise over time the first time it has used those words to describe the pace of tightening poloz told a news conference the reference to over time was meant to inject a degree of ambiguity into the timing of future rate increases given the setbacks from oil and housing the talk of further hikes helped boost the canadian dollar which extended earlier gains touching c 1 3180 to the u s greenback or 75 87 u s cents it later settled back to c 1 3225 to the u s dollar or 75 61 u s cents it s a bit more hawkish than the market expected at this point the market was expecting that maybe we are done said benjamin tal deputy chief economist at cibc world markets the central bank cut its near term growth forecasts to reflect the impact of crude prices but said the slowdown should be temporary and predicted the economy would post above potential growth in 2020 the bank noted that much of the economy was operating close to capacity but said consumption spending and housing investment had been weaker than expected as housing markets adjusted to tougher mortgage rules and higher interest rates looking ahead the bank said exports and non energy investment were expected to grow solidly moved forward by foreign demand a new north american free trade pact a weaker canadian dollar and federal tax measures aimed at investment the bank noted signs that the u s chinese trade war was hitting global demand and commodity prices but adopted a positive long term outlook the bank held its overnight interest rate at 1 75 percent well below the neutral rate of 2 5 percent to 3 5 percent where monetary policy is neither stimulative or accommodative we still expect further modest tightening this year they re indicating that there s an ongoing commitment to move official rates to a neutral range so further rate hikes are in the offing said paul ferley assistant chief economist at the royal bank of canada the bank cut its forecast for fourth quarter annualized growth to 1 3 percent from the 2 3 percent it predicted in october and pegged first quarter growth at just 0 8 percent it trimmed the forecast for overall 2019 growth to 1 7 percent from 2 1 percent investment in the canadian oil and gas sector would decline by about 12 percent in 2019 compared with the 1 5 percent drop it predicted in october it said the bank said the damage that current low oil prices will inflict on the economy would be about a quarter of that done during a crude slump from 2014 to 2016 since that time the importance of the energy sector has lessened additional reporting by matt scuffham nichola saminather fergal smith and anna mehler paperny in toronto editing by steve orlofsky and james dalgleish

as of november 14 2018 vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer thank you dan good morning everyone ricky and i would like to make a few comments and then we will answer your questions our results for the first quarter were solid despite continuing inflationary cost pressures we took several actions in the quarter to address these cost issues including price increases and productivity improvements further our top line growth this quarter continued our long trend of outperforming the overall growth rates of the markets we serve while diluted earnings per share grew 17 to 1 98 a first quarter record i know many of you have already seen have seen our results and ricky will provide more detail later in the call but i d like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the first quarter of 2019 our net sales for the first quarter were a record 933 million an increase of 11 compared with the year ago period reported operating profit was 116 4 million compared with 120 2 million in the year ago period reported diluted earnings per share was 1 98 compared with 1 70 in the year ago period there were adjustments in both quarters for certain special items as well as certain other add backs necessary for our results to be comparable between periods as ricky will explain later in the call in adding back these items one can see adjusted operating profit for the first quarter of 2019 was 134 1 million compared with adjusted operating profit of 135 5 million in the year ago period a slight decrease of 1 adjusted operating profit margin was 14 4 a decrease of 170 basis points compared with the margin reported in the prior year adjusted diluted earnings per share was 2 32 a first quarter record up 20 from the year ago period net cash provided by operating activities was a solid 132 million this quarter while our cash position at the end of the quarter grew to 215 million even after repurchasing 25 million of the company s stock during the quarter leaving us with plenty of liquidity to execute our growth strategies looking at some specific details for the quarter net sales increased almost 11 over the year ago period overall net sales volume grew approximately 11 while price mix of products sold was essentially flat this quarter acquisitions net of divestitures added about one point to our growth which was essentially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency and the adoption of the new accounting standard asc 606 our significant growth in net sales this quarter was due in large part because of continued efforts to expand our customer base and the introduction of new products and solutions we also believe our net sales were favorably impacted somewhat this quarter by customers accelerating orders in advance of the effective dates for announced price increases overall we experienced solid growth in net sales in most channels and geographies as well as most product categories the largest contributors to the increase in net sales volume were due to greater demand for our atrius based luminaires and lighting control solutions as well as several building management solutions created by our distech team and greater shipments of certain high volume more basic lesser featured led fixtures primarily for applications on smaller and mid sized commercial projects as well as our infrastructure and utility products solutions sold through our independent sales network which serves the c i utility and building management channels grew 10 this quarter compared with the year ago period this network comprises approximately 70 of our total net sales this growth was impacted somewhat by continued weak demand for larger nonresidential lighting projects as well as continued product substitution to lower priced alternatives for certain lighting products during the quarter we announced two price increases to recover higher costs for both component and other input items due to inflation as well as the impact of government tariffs enacted on certain china sourced finished goods and components as noted earlier we believe some of the increase in net sales this quarter was due in part to customers buying products this quarter in advance of the effective dates of the announced price increases it is impossible to quantify the exact impact this had on our sales growth is quarter we expect this to have a small dampening effect on our growth rate in the second quarter historically our lowest net sales quarter in any given year due to seasonality though again it is impossible to quantify the impact as you all know changes in price mix have been a headwind each quarter for the last few years so to experience a very slight favorability call it neutral this quarter was a welcome change while it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of changes in the price and mix of products sold we estimate the neutral impact of price mix this quarter was primarily due to changes in channel mix mostly offset by both product price and mix which included substitutions to lower priced alternatives primarily for more basic lesser featured led luminaires sold in certain channels as well as a modest decline in shipments for larger commercial projects as noted earlier lastly while we believe the price increases we ve put in place will be realized much of the sales in the first quarter were at pre increased levels due to both the timing of price increases implemented in various channels as well as shipments of orders at pre increased prices were previously committed projects as part of the company s backlog based on the information from various data collection and forecasting organizations we believe the overall growth rate in the first quarter as measured at dollars for the lighting market in north america was up low single digits reflecting continued improvement in demand reversing the sluggish trend over the last several quarters our net sales growth rate of approximately 11 even excluding any potential pull forward of sales due to the announced price increases stands in stark contrast of the overall goal growth rate of the luminaire market in north america we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new more innovative and holistic lighting and building management solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to continue to gain overall share in the north american market this quarter our profitability measures for the first quarter were solid given overall market conditions they were impacted mostly by significantly higher costs particularly for certain commodities and components as well as freight and wages which i will address in a moment and to a lesser degree continued product substitution to lower priced alternatives as well as weakness for larger commercial projects our adjusted operating profit for the quarter was 134 million down approximately 1 compared with the year ago period while adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 14 4 down about 170 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year ago period the decrease in adjusted operating profit margin was primarily due to the decline in adjusted gross profit margin adjusted gross profit margin for the first quarter was 39 5 a decrease of about 200 basis points compared with the year ago period it is very important to understand the underlying factors that drove the decline in our margins this quarter and the actions we took to counter those factors as well as the timing of financial impact of those actions adjusted gross profit increased 19 million this quarter over the year ago period driven primarily by higher sales volume and productivity improvements partially offset by higher input costs our adjusted gross profit and margin were negatively impacted by higher input costs for certain items including electronic and oil based components freight and certain other commodity related items such as steel many of these items experienced dramatic increases in price over the last half of our fiscal 2018 due to several economic factors including new tariffs and wage inflation caused by tight labor markets we estimate the inflationary impact of these items reduced our gross profit this quarter by approximately 16 million and lowered our gross profit margin by approximately 170 basis points as noted earlier we took significant actions this quarter that we believe both help and will continue to help offset these and other cost increases including wage inflation as well as the impact of currently enacted increases in tariffs these actions included announced price increases and other measures to improve productivity and reduce costs we believe that due to the timing of price increases they had limited positive benefit on our first quarter results we believe these price increases will begin to offset higher input costs including recently enacted tariffs in our second quarter and beyond it is important to note that our adjusted gross profit margin increased 60 basis points on a sequential basis this quarter from the fourth quarter of 2018 on lower revenues primarily due to the improvement in sales channel mix and actions to improve our cost structure next our adjusted sda expenses were up approximately 20 million compared with the year ago period adjusted sda expense as a percentage of net sales was 25 2 in the first quarter a decrease of 20 basis points from the year ago period demonstrating the leverage of our sda investment as our net sales volume grows the increase in adjusted sda expense was primarily due to higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales greater employee related cost and to a lesser degree added expenses from recent acquisitions partially offset by actions taken in prior periods to streamline the organization excluding the impact of higher freight and commission expense due to the increase in net sales volume more than half of the increase in sda expense compared with prior periods was due to greater employee related costs while our salaried headcount remained essentially flat year over year even after acquisitions we expect that employee related costs will continue to rise in fiscal 2019 as markets for certain skills remain tight contributing to a rise in wage inflation our adjusted diluted eps was a first quarter record of 2 32 compared with 1 94 reported in the year ago period an increase of 20 the increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of the new tax law and the lower average shares outstanding due to stock repurchases during the past year partially offset by a slight decline in operating profit in the quarter as i noted earlier we believe the year over year increases in certain input costs reduced our gross profit by approximately 16 million in the quarter and obviously negatively impact our diluted earnings per share before i turn the call over to ricky i would like to comment on a few important accomplishments this past quarter on the strategic and technology front we continue to make great strides setting the stage for what we believe will be strong revenue growth and profitability over the long term we continue to gain market share in many important product categories and sales channels our tier 3 and 4 solutions were up over 25 this quarter from a commercial perspective we continue to accelerate a number of atrius enabled deployments and increased active programs with several of the largest u s based retailers our atrius based iot luminaires and solutions are becoming the industry standard in the retail segment additionally we continue to expand these solutions into other channels as awareness by customer grows as they come to recognize the full benefits of these solutions including superior visual comfort and energy savings as well as the capabilities of our iot solutions providing them with the opportunity to transform their spaces from nothing more than an expense item into a strategic asset as i mentioned in prior earnings calls it is clear that certain chinese based lighting companies many obviously being subsidized in some form are influencing pricing for certain basic lesser featured fixtures sold in certain channels we will not yield this space for many strategic reasons as such we continued to aggressively expand our contractor select portfolio to profitably compete in this portion of the market also as i mentioned last quarter we introduced in late 2018 the next generation of our industry leading lighting control system nlight air a wireless control system with a wide range of options and functionality for which there was strong customer demand this quarter we believe acuity has the most comprehensive and feature rich wired and wireless lighting control systems available in the nonresidential construction market and importantly they are connected to our growing bms solutions lastly we initiated many actions last year to further streamline our operations to reduce costs and improve our productivity we believe these initiatives both enhanced our performance this quarter and will continue to benefit our operating and financial performance in the future as well as allow us to accelerate investments in areas with higher growth opportunities ricky will have additional comments on this in a moment we ve been able to create these capabilities while providing industry leading results because of the dedication resolve of our many associates who are maniacally focused on serving solving and supporting the needs of our customers i will talk more about our expectations for the balance of 2019 later in the call i would like to now turn the call over to ricky ricky ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you vern and good morning everyone as vern mentioned earlier we had some adjustments to the gaap results in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 which we find useful to add back in order for the results to be comparable in our earnings release and form 10 q we provide a detailed reconciliation of non gaap measures for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and 2018 adjusted results exclude the impact of acquisition related items amortization expense for acquired intangible assets share based payment expense and special charges for streamlining activities we believe adjusting for these items and providing these non gaap measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations we think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we recognized a pre tax special charge of 1 million primarily related to move costs associated with the previously announced transfer of activities from a planned facility closure in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year we recorded a pre tax special charge of 200 000 we expect to continue to incur additional costs primarily attributed to early lease termination and moving costs in future periods associated with the closing of certain facilities related to the streamlining actions announced in fiscal year 2018 fiscal 2019 first quarter results were impacted by the adoption of accounting standards codification 606 revenues from contracts with customers which negatively impacted current period revenues by 2 4 million gross profit by 1 1 million and operating profit by 1 2 million as compared with the prior year period additionally fiscal 2018 results were restated to reflect the impact of adopting a new accounting standard regarding retirement benefits which resulted in an increase in operating profit of 1 6 million with an equal offsetting increase in other expenses resulting in no impact on fiscal 2018 reported net income or eps please refer to note 4 and 5 to our financial statements included in our form 10 q filed earlier today for additional details of the impact of the adoption of new accounting standards on both the income statement and balance sheet as part of adopting asc 606 you can see in our form 10 q filed today that we are providing disaggregated revenues by the major sales channels of one independent sales network which includes c i agencies infrastructure utility agencies system integrators and showrooms two direct sales network three retail network which includes home centers and digital retail four corporate accounts and five all other which is primarily oem international and catalog the effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was 25 2 compared with 35 5 in the prior year quarter the effective income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was significantly impacted by the provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act which was enacted during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 we currently estimate that our blended effective income tax rate before discrete items will approximate 24 to 26 for fiscal 2019 we generated 132 million of net cash flow provided by operating activities during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with 140 million for the year ago period operating working capital defined as receivables plus inventory less payables decreased 31 million during the first three months of fiscal 2019 this decrease is largely due to reduced account receivable balance our operating working capital days increased 10 days to 60 days primarily due to higher inventory at november 30 2018 compared to august 31 2018 at november 30 2018 we added cash and cash equivalent balance of 215 million an increase of 86 million since august 31 2018 this increase was due primarily to cash flow from operations partially offset by cash used to repurchase common stock to invest in plant and equipment and to pay dividends we repurchased 200 000 shares for 25 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 in addition we have repurchased an additional 200 000 shares for 24 million since the end of our first quarter we have 4 8 million shares remaining under our current share repurchase board authorization our investment in capital expenditures was 14 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 an increase of almost 4 million compared with the prior year period we currently expect to invest approximately 1 5 of net sales in capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 on june 29 2018 we entered into a new credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides us with a 400 million five year unsecured revolving credit facility and a 400 million unsecured delayed draw five year term loan facility our total debt outstanding was 357 million at november 30 2018 our debt to capitalization at august 31 2018 was 16 9 and net debt to capital was 7 5 we had additional borrowing capacity of 795 million at november 30 2018 under our new credit and term loan facilities which do not expire until june 2023 we clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility to support our growth opportunities which may include acquisitions and we will continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value thank you and i ll turn the call back over to vern vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer thank you ricky while current market conditions in the lighting industry continue to be challenging we continue to be optimistic regarding our long term future we believe our many actions to improve our market reach enhance our customer solutions and capabilities and to drive companywide productivity will help optimize our financial performance in the future while affording us the opportunity to continue to invest in areas we believe have high growth potential over the long term our robust sales growth significant cash flow and upper quartile return on invested capital are reflective of our strong operating performance despite some of these current industry headwinds our views on overall market demand for the lighting market and items influencing costs have not really changed over the last quarter so let me reiterate some of those key items that could influence our performance for the balance of fiscal 2019 many independent third party forecasts continue to suggest the overall construction market as measured in dollars will grow in the low to mid single digit range we still believe the lighting industry will lag the overall growth rate of construction market somewhat primarily due to continued product substitution to lower priced alternatives for certain products sold through certain channels though recent industry pricing actions should have a favorable impact on growth as measured in dollars additionally we expect that labor shortages in certain markets could continue to negatively impact growth rates for both construction and lighting while the u s government delayed the implementation of increased tariffs to 25 from the current 10 for certain imported chinese made finished goods until march 1 we believe the outcome of the entire tariff situation could have a dampening effect on overall demand due to higher component cost and finished good prices further it is evident that the global trade issues have certainly created greater volatility in demand in our various end markets and we expect that to continue as previously mentioned we believe the announced price increases and other actions taken will in time offset the increases in cost for various items noted earlier while increases in some input costs such as steel have leveled off for now we expect other costs and expenses such as imported electrical components and finished goods freight and wages will continue to rise these potential cost increases questions and answers operator thank you matt mccall from seaport global securities you may go ahead matt mccall seaport global securities analyst thanks good morning guys so vern maybe start with the comment you made about expanding contractor select to profitably compete in that market can you talk about the just the trends since the reinvigoration or reintroduction of that product the trends in the profitability in recent quarters and then expectations just trying to understand what you were referencing when you made that specific comment vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer sure well just to further make a comment i wasn t able to finish the prepared remarks so there are probably some other important things that i ll touch on as we get toward the end of the call but matt let me begin to address your questions yes contractor select was a relaunch of a product portfolio that was directed at if you will lesser featured more value oriented products and what we did is we had a number of products branded maybe under lithonia but we created recreated if you will a contractor select to have a more fulsome portfolio directed specifically at that market with new products that had better cost structures for us better price points some of those products continue to be manufactured both in asia as well as in our north american manufacturing footprint so our margins in those have improved and we continue to see growth contractor select is designed to serve both the home center channel as well as the electrical distribution channel and then to a lesser degree showrooms and our digital retail capability so we continue to see growth in those in that portfolio and it did have or has had some positive impact on our margins as we said in the quarter which was really exciting for us price mix overall was very slightly favorable let s just call it neutral which is the first time we ve experienced that geez ricky in probably in the last two to three years so part of that benefit has been due to actions taken like the introduction of contractor select matt mccall seaport global securities analyst ok thank you and maybe continuing on that thought the you mentioned some of the product comes from asia your manufacturing part of it i guess i m trying to understand the impact on your gross contribution margin do you still get the same leverage opportunities from that sourced product and will that i m really thinking about the substitution effect of just the product coming in out of asia do you sacrifice some maybe leverage opportunity but you benefit from lower costs i m assuming or i m sure just help me understand the impact in how we should think about gross contribution margin from just pure volume just given the shifts in substitution or trends with substitution dan smith senior vice president treasurer and secretary sure so as we stated in our 10 k approximately 20 of our total sales are produced by others about 15 ricky is produced in asia ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer correct 15 yes vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer i think that was the number so that s up a little bit from say prior years we obviously have a very strong supply chain in asia when you say we lose a little bit of leverage sure when you re not manufacturing in your own facilities increases in volume you re not able to really leverage that across your fixed cost base but we like the margin profile of our portfolio and contractor select and as we think about product substitution again this quarter it was essentially awash price mix was essential awash which again first time in a long time so the efforts that we re putting in to products like contractor select not just contractor select allowed us to again have price mix be awashed i would tell you that product substitution it will continue and the way we are attacking that to offset product substitution and what that simply means is that we are moving from a product that has one price point to something that has a lower price point it s entirely possible that the gross profit margin on the lower price point item is actually higher as a percentage of the sale than on the higher price point so we continue to push our mix as a company into those areas that we realize both higher profit dollars as well as higher profit margin a good example of that is in our controls business our controls overall business and it s impossible to call it a separate business because so much of our controls are embedded into our luminaires but we re seeing great uplift as we continue to introduce new products and solutions such as nlight air into the marketplace with great demand so that benefit of that price mix was also because of the introduction of products like that matt mccall seaport global securities analyst ok very helpful thank you vern operator thank you and our next question comes from jeffrey sprague from vertical research partners you may go ahead sir jeffrey sprague vertical research partners analyst thank you good morning everyone hey two from me first on substitution i wonder if you have a sense of how much is happening kind of at the front end relative to the initial bid versus a response to price cost dynamics in the project later in the construction process and a need to get costs out given other inflationary pressures that may have arisen during the project itself is there is a discernible difference there vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer well let me take a cut at it and then ricky can take a cut product substitution is occurring in two key areas and it s just it s interesting it s trends of how people want to if you will use light the shift from certain 2 by 2 2 by 4 1 by 4 fixtures to flat panels for example is a trend that has been in the marketplace for a while so as acuity ramps up its capabilities in the flat panel business and i believe that today we are the largest seller of flat panels in the north american market at least that s what our data would suggest and that s over the last call it less than 18 months that that s occurred well that product is replacing certain other form factors and those other form factors were simply at higher prices and so that s an example another example is slim form wafers replacing certain types of down lighting again profitability off of those products for us is from a margin percentage is favorable but yet just pure dollars because the physical construct of that product is meaningfully different than something that it is substituting in certain applications so it is both upfront but it s also in our stock business it s also being sold through whether it s electrical distribution channel or whether it s being sold through the home center or the showroom or our digital retail capabilities for what i ll call renovation projects it s just people looking at different choices that they have in terms of how they want their space to look and how they want it to operate and so that product substitution or that shift is having some change on top line if you will dollars units are obviously up higher but dollars tend to be lower and this is again why for me it s very exciting for us to show an almost an 11 top line growth while all of this is going on jeffrey sprague vertical research partners analyst and also just on tier 3 tier 4 you continue to see good growth in units can you give us a little update though in terms of actually turning the capabilities on what s happening there service revenues associated with it etc vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes we re seeing nice growth but off of an incredibly small base and so what we ve learned in this process is that people who deploy our atrius based luminaires are looking for some level of critical mass within their own facilities or number of facilities so as they install they re now beginning to experiment use we have certain customers that are much further along than others and they are now actually starting to use apps within their space we re helping them do that that obviously creates an increase in if you will revenue stream for acuity but the tier 4 saas revenues are still really small but growing i mean they re doubling so we re very very excited about the prospects of what that saas revenue looks like particularly as customers start to use the solutions or use the capabilities of the solutions that they purchased and so as expected it s now starting to ramp and you re seeing that multiplier effect occur but again against the 3 8 billion acuity brands it really does not move the needle just yet but it will it s moving the needle by the way in us selling iot enabled luminaires in a very significant way the part of our growth is because of our enterprise solutions capability which is selling virtually all iot enabled luminaires and that piece of our business continues to grow nicely jeffrey sprague vertical research partners analyst right thanks operator thank you our next question comes from john walsh with credit suisse you may go ahead sir john walsh credit suisse analyst hi good morning vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer good morning john walsh credit suisse analyst so i m going to apologize because i don t know if i fully understood the answer to jeff s question but maybe i can just ask it again in a little different way as we think about the product substitution is that when the project first starts so when the initial bid happens or are you seeing the general contractors actually break the spec later in the construction process and then seeing the substitution happening there where you have to go and fight what the contractor is trying to do to the spec just trying to understand that dynamic a little bit better vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes that s a great question so generally speaking for projects products like this are spec ed in but the normal cycle of just general contracting capabilities is that they may spec something else and this has happened historically for years for decades you get down to now at the end of the project because lighting is some of the last stuff in someone may say listen i need to alter the specification to a degree because i m out of budget and i need to be in budget so some of these products provide great alternatives but their features and benefits are not the same as what may have been spec ed in so you can have a combination of both but for acuity again if you go back to more traditional lighting acuity never participated in the lamp ballast replacement business today we have a product portfolio that is amply suited for replacement of existing luminaires so when we sell these types of products through certain channels very often they are for renovation projects which we have said for a long time is a growth rich opportunity for acuity or they may be part of smaller projects where there is not a specification and the builder is saying hey this product looks like it s a fantastic opportunity or the owner says this is something that i like flat panels as a form factor are becoming very popular and so again that product substitution is because that product category is growing significantly because people like those form factors it s simply displacing other types of product that may have had a higher price point and they re willing to accept any feature or benefit difference should there be any so it can be both but generally speaking someone is not using that flat panel to break a spec they re using it as something that they have specified in and acuity will be introducing a spec grade product or a flat panel family which is a whole different opportunity but no i would say that it s part of the normal course of business and these features and benefits that these products have are attractive at those price points john walsh credit suisse analyst ok thank you and then just thinking about this potential or the prebuy impact ahead of the price increases obviously very difficult to parse that out but you did say you thought there could be some dampening impact in the next quarter i mean is that to think a couple of points is that kind of the order of magnitude that you have in your head when you use the word dampening or is there a more specific range that you would point us to vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes i would say to the extent because it s impossible for us to precisely quantify it i would say that to the extent we assume there was some and we ve seen some evidence but to quantify that and say ok here is a number we just we didn t even try because it wouldn t have been worth that effort but to the extent that there was some it would have been generally speaking a pull primarily from q2 into q1 we can t estimate it ricky any other thoughts on that ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer no i mean we ve looked at it in a lot of different ways some of the pull forward was within the same quarter so obviously it has no impact on our quarterly results so it s pretty hard to put a bread basket around it john walsh credit suisse analyst ok i appreciate it thank you ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you the next question comes from tim wojs from baird you may go ahead sir tim wojs robert w baird co analyst hey guys good morning vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer good morning tim wojs robert w baird co analyst just on i m just curious just if you could give us a little bit of color on just what you re seeing around pricing traction in the marketplace i know there s a lot of variabilities between price and mix but if you just look at like for like pricing and based on some of the increases that you ve put in the market is there any sort of estimate you could give or what you re seeing in terms of how much of those price increases are starting to stick vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer ricky do you want to tackle that ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer yes in the quarter is as vern said in his prepared remarks very little impact in this first quarter most of the price increases were implemented mid quarter and we protected certain channels as well as the delay due to projects as vern mentioned that were in our backlog but we are committed to the price increase and do see evidence that in most of the channels it is sticking it is coming in at different time lines in different channels but we are continuing to be pretty firm in our resolve with the increases because they were real cost increases inflationary as well as the tariffs that we re needing to offset and we are holding firm most of the major competitors have announced similar if not identical price increases to us so that is encouraging but as we always see in price increases it varies by geography it will vary by channel somewhat as to how quickly they get implemented and to what extent but we still are very committed to the announced increases we put out vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer and ricky if i could just pile on a little bit two thirds of our total business is bid business and so and that hasn t changed we have experienced real cost increases we will continue to aggressively look to recover those both through price increases that we ve announced as well as productivity improvements we look at every project and decide whether that s something a piece of business that we re after as ricky pointed out different channels have different contractual obligations so we are implementing our price increases because these cost increases are real to us and we re evaluating as we always do what our product portfolio looks like relative to how we serve and support our customer base relative to how we make money and so we are aggressively focused on pushing through price generally speaking the industry is pretty disciplined when cost increases come about of putting those into the marketplace and to the extent that those things ebb and flow yes on the bid business we look to optimize our profitability by all measures so we have seen our price increases be implemented into the marketplace and we re pleased with the progress that we ve made so far tim wojs robert w baird co analyst great great and then just thinking about seasonality and just trying to make sure we re all on the same page the second quarter is typically your weakest revenue quarter so while i think price would probably have a little bit of a sequential impact you d also lose some leverage so is it fair to assume that the gross margin sequentially are down some from q1 just in line with historical seasonality before seeing a more market improvement in the stronger months in your fiscal year vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes i would say that this seasonality is normal we ve had this for forever and you re absolutely correct in assuming that the leverage of volume does have an impact we are looking to recover some of the cost increases that we ve through price again as we said earlier the timing of some of these things depending on the channel the contracts that you have with the customer but no our expectation is that as we enter into q2 it will not be materially different than other q2s as it relates to the seasonality i do have well we are optimistic we re seeing positive signs within the construction market we continue to see some of the volatility in demand that is caused by people s concerns around tariffs and what s going to happen in trade negotiations i wish i could tell you differently we have a positive view of the overall market but it s still tempered by what happens intra quarter from one quarter to the next because someone says hey i m going to wait to see what happens with this trade policy it s just it s frustrating for us because we believe that there is momentum out there and there is a real need if i look at all of the demographics of rising employment vacancy rates going down rental rates going up absorption of real estate these are all favorable signs and longer term bullish signs for nonresidential construction so it s a bit of a dr jekyll and hyde kind of thing but overall we re net positive in what we see going forward tim wojs robert w baird co analyst thanks for the comments good luck operator thank you our next question comes from ryan merkel with william blair you may go ahead sir ryan merkel william blair analyst hey thanks i just want to follow up on the gross margin question so do you think that you re going to recover the 170 basis points of price cost in the fiscal second quarter or might it take a little longer vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer so as ricky and i said the price increases that have been enacted some of those take time to roll in because of contractual obligations because of our backlog i think we will make good progress on recapturing those costs we don t give guidance on that entirely i don t want to comment completely on that but our price increases and our resolve around capturing those price increases are important for us to recover our costs ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer and i would just comment brian that and vern had it in his prepared remarks we are still seeing inflationary cost increases beyond what we ve historic what are in our first quarter results so wage inflation is alive and well our merit increases went into effect mid or second last third of our first quarter so all of that impact will be in our second quarter so we will continue to have some inflationary cost increases we need to offset all the reason why these price increases were so necessary ryan merkel william blair analyst got it so it sounds like you expect to make progress that we shouldn t expect you can recover the full amount in the fiscal second quarter vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer we don t give guidance ryan merkel william blair analyst ok fair enough all right and then back to the issue of pull forward maybe just comment on the order rate in december potentially that could tell us a little bit about what s going on and what the pull forward could be vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes we have not seen a meaningful change compared to the prior year in our order rates again my concern is less around the pull forward and more around just how do people release projects how are people feeling about their businesses it is becoming more and more evident to us that labor shortages in large markets are having a dampening effect on construction in general and then lighting to a lesser degree so we are looking at the overall demand and why are people doing things we continue to see strength in smaller and midsized projects which may not be as impacted by labor shortages as larger projects so we can continue to see this dynamic going on it gets exacerbated to a degree or the fluctuation volatility to a degree because of q2 weather related things but no we continue to see what we would call normal trend so again that s why it s impossible for us to say oh gosh it s this percent that will impact first quarter versus second quarter ricky reece executive vice president and chief financial officer i would just mention while not directly part of your question another uncertainty out there is this potentially next round of tariff increases on finished goods coming from china march 1 is the date the administration said those would become effective which is obviously the end of our second quarter will those go forward what impact may that have on demand but also on potential pull forward because we ve indicated as others that we re going to have a price increase contemporaneous with that tariff increase so that s another uncertainty we re looking at here in the second quarter it could have an impact on order rates depending on whether that tariff increase goes forward or not ryan merkel william blair analyst very helpful guys i ll pass it on thanks operator thank you our next question comes from rich kwas with wells fargo securities deepa raghavan wells fargo securities analyst good morning this is deepa for rich kwas hope you re well two quick questions for me first one is can you comment on the state of nonres cycle and what you re hearing from the field especially commercial versus institutional large commercial softness obviously you continue to mention that in your project commentary but do you think that is cycle driven or is that more like a short term impact from all the headline uncertainty tariffs etc that we see vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer so on the nonres piece for small medium projects i think that again the portfolio of solutions that acuity and to a degree others have to offer are favorable energy saving so good returns on investments so i think that people continue to move those along particularly to the extent that they have access to electricians in their local market so i see that as being favorable larger projects all of the big indicators rental rates rental vacancy absorption of real estate employment all of those are usually leading indicators of construction particularly around medium and larger projects without getting into the specific verticals of nonresidential construction we still have favorable but our favorability or optimism is somewhat tempered by again in some of these key markets the availability of electricians to do some of these projects and by the way what we re talking about here is growth right all of these folks have good backlogs they have projects out there whether they re the electrical distributor or the electrical contractor it s just that if their workforce is a limiting factor to their ability to grow and again in the lighting space we continue to experience a bit of deflation for the reasons we ve all articulated i think that there should be legs there in terms of what s going to happen in nonresidential construction but we have to solve some of these labor issues deepa raghavan wells fargo securities analyst got it can you comment on your residential piece of business i mean what was your resi growth in the quarter and have you seen any deceleration or stability in that piece of your business vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes so we don t measure it exactly as residential because we sell product that has residential applications and or light commercial applications through multiple channels we would sell those products through the home center channel we would sell them through the electrical distribution channel we would sell them through the showroom channel those products or those channels as ricky pointed out earlier are network sales for us that represents about 70 of our business which would have some resi in there it was up about 10 on the retail channel ricky which would also be resi and light commercial we saw favorability there so we continue to see favorable movements i know that residential construction has kind of moved sideways here a little bit but i think that that is just temporary i mean you look at the number of workers the population continues to grow rental rates continue to increase i just i m still bullish over the long term on residential construction and capabilities and i think acuity is well positioned to play there deepa raghavan wells fargo securities analyst got it final one for me so just given all the prebuy and all the due to the price increases can you comment on the state of inventory in the channel should we be concerned at all i mean you talked about some pull forward but just curious on the inventory in the channel vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes i don t know that i m saying that there s inventory in the channel i think that the channel manages its inventory pretty well both on residential and nonresidential but from our perspective our inventories are up a bit because we have extended some of our supply chain to asia that s increased a little bit adding a little bit more inventory into the system but we also continue to grow in certain markets pick our enterprise solution market where as that business grows we re required to maintain certain levels of inventory to support store renovation construction and so that s caused us to have to carry a little bit more inventory but i think that the channel of the electrical distribution the channel of the home center so on and so forth all those inventory levels seem to be appropriate given the economic activity that s out there operator thank you and our final question comes from christopher glynn with oppenheimer you may go ahead sir christopher glynn oppenheimer holdings analyst thanks good morning guys vern did i catch that someone out there may be thought you should tighten your prepared comments i guess so vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer thank you chris i think that was you and by the way all the questions that folks asked that was in my prepared remarks christopher glynn oppenheimer holdings analyst i m sure so your volume outgrowth was pretty profound in the second half of last year i m wondering how to think about those comparison run rates there in the absence of guidance how would you advise we consider that and maybe part of that context is if you could describe the trend with the building breadth of customers now creating critical tier 3 mass for themselves pursuant to entering the tier 4 base vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer yes our business continues to diversify both in terms of within channels so if you look at the home center business we continue to diversify our customer base there also looking to evaluate our portfolio in some of those things so there s a little bit of ebbing and flowing going on i love what we re doing in our enterprise solutions capabilities this is really where we re selling our iot and atrius enabled luminaires into retail and other segments specifically on how they purchase well those the acceptance of those products are significant but the problem not the problem the opportunity is that that s very lumpy i mean when someone says hey look we don t want you in our retail stores from the beginning of november until the kind of middle of january you could appreciate that s when they make most of their money in terms of a lot of these retailers so anyway i expect our growth to continue to outpace the overall growth rate of the markets that we serve we ve had a good track record of doing that some of the influences that we ve had here over the last couple of quarters as we mentioned we expanded our customer base in certain channels which caused us to have a bit of call it load in of certain things some of those things will come back to normal volume and activity so it may not be quite to the level because you don t have those load ins happening every quarter that we experienced in fourth and first quarter but again i think that we will we have a long track record of outperforming the overall growth rates of the markets that we serve and i think that that s probably a pretty good indicator as you think about your models of how did we grow last year how do you think the markets going to grow where do you think acuity is going to be i think you can get yourself into a reasonable range around that christopher glynn oppenheimer holdings analyst yes that works and then just the inventory is up on the magnitude of a quarter year over year just wondering if you could comment on the strategic aspects of that inventory build versus whatever working capital execution factors and the free cash flow conversion outlook for the year vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer sure so we continue to have good cash flow conversion our inventory levels as we bring on whether it be through enterprise solutions or customers in certain other channels we are working that into our business but our expectations would be that we would improve our inventory turns as our business processes to support that those growing aspects of our business come into both focus as well as we get our processes honed out said simply we have too much inventory right now relative to the service levels it s just getting those processes honed between ourselves and the customers their pos their store increases some of the projects that we have worked on within our utility channel our utility business continues to grow significantly well there are requirements for inventory until we get that pipeline really smoothed out we ve added inventory to support the service levels so our expectation as a company and it s really critical to us to get our inventory turns back to where they should be with levels of service that are commensurate with customers expectations so i believe that by the end of the year you will see our inventory turns and our inventory levels improve relative to the it s days on hand that s important and it s service that s important it s not the dollars that are important so we want to get those metrics back to where we think we ought to be operating christopher glynn oppenheimer holdings analyst thanks have a good one operator thank you i would like to turn the call back over to mr vernon nagel for closing remarks vern nagel chairman president and chief executive officer folks thank you so much yes some of my remarks were cut off a bit but i think we answered some of the things i would have said during the q a so again i d like to thank you for your time this morning again we strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives deploying the proper strategies and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that have the potential over the longer term to deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders our future is bright thank you for your support operator duration 65 minutes call participants dan smith senior vice president treasurer and secretary

source xinhua 2019 01 11 06 43 40 editor mu xuequan video player close new york jan 10 xinhua the u s dollar bounced on thursday as u s federal reserve s chairman jerome powell said prolonged government shutdown would lead to unclear prospect and sluggish economic data which consequently drove up investors risk aversion and in turn boosted the greenback s safe haven demand a longer shutdown is something we haven t had he added if we have an extended shutdown i do think that would show up in the data pretty clear powell said in a discussion at the economic club of washington on thursday we would have a less clear picture into the economy if it were to go on much longer powell said the fed chair also indicated that monetary tightening would go on as it will continue to scale back the central bank s balance sheet which would reduce the amount of money flowing in the market it will be substantially smaller than it is now powell said it will be smaller than it is now but nowhere near where it was before in terms of fed s move to raise interest rates powell said we re waiting and watching as inflation is low and under control such remarks were in line with the wait and see stance shown in the federal open market committee policy meeting minutes released on wednesday the dollar index which measures the greenback against six major peers was up 0 34 percent at 95 5431 in late trading in late new york trading the euro was down to 1 1499 dollars from 1 1544 dollars in the previous session and the british pound decreased to 1 2744 dollars from 1 2794 u s dollars in the previous session the australian dollar rose to 0 7182 dollar from 0 7180 dollar the u s dollar bought 108 42 japanese yen higher than 108 26 japanese yen of the previous session the u s dollar rose to 0 9842 swiss franc from 0 9750 swiss franc and it increased to 1 3227 canadian dollars from 1 3221 canadian dollars
it s time to see the numbers investors are about to get a read on the health of corporate america as businesses begin releasing quarterly profit reports and laying out expectations for the coming year the results may resolve a roaring debate on wall street that has pitted economists who have argued that the economy remains healthy against investors who pushed stocks to the brink of a bear market over concerns that growth is waning as we hear from more companies about how the year ended we ll get more color on which side has a better feel the economics community or the equity community said lori calvasina head of u s equity strategy at rbc capital markets on the whole the numbers are expected to be solid wall street analysts estimate that when all the results are in for s p 500 companies fourth quarter profits will have risen 15 per cent over a year earlier that would be the fifth straight period of double digit profit growth according to i b e s data from refinitiv it doesn t guarantee investors will be happy the last round of results which began to arrive in october showed even faster growth but did little to stem the stock market s rapid sell off at the end of the year that s in part because wall street is looking ahead how factors like a global slowdown and rising interest rates will affect future profits investors won t have to wait long as next week will bring results from banks including jpmorgan chase and goldman sachs as well as companies like delta and netflix here are some of the questions investors will be seeking answers to as they weigh whether they went too far with the sell off will china s slump hurt america s businesses for much of 2018 investors were surprisingly willing to shrug off risks posed by the trade war that erupted between china and the united states the world s two largest economies but as the dispute has dragged on and stretched from its original focus on america s yawning trade deficit with china to seemingly intractable questions over technological and geopolitical dominance it s starting to take a toll china s economy is showing signs of weakness and that s bad news for companies that count the country as a major market apple recently slashed its sales forecast for the first time in 16 years citing weak sales of iphones in china where the economy is growing at its slowest pace in a decade south korean giant samsung a huge producer of both smartphones and semiconductors similarly cut its profit outlook citing weak global growth and the impact isn t limited to tech ford fedex starbucks and tiffany have all noted weakness in china as a risk in recent months furthermore it isn t just china the slowdown is rippling through other economies germany s industrial engine which exports high end autos and industrial equipment to china is sputtering and dragging on european growth and japan s economy the world s third largest contracted in the third quarter what s the mood of american consumers for companies that aren t heavily exposed to foreign markets the outlook for domestic consumption which accounts for roughly two thirds of america s economic activity is what matters on that front the news is still mostly good last year consumer sentiment measures showed americans to be largely inured to a noisy political and economic climate there are good reasons this resilience could continue wages are rising gas prices have fallen and americans who stand to benefit from the trump administration s tax overhaul could start to see higher tax refunds roll in over the coming months it s tough to again have a recession when consumers are getting more money from tax refunds and oil prices are lower said keith parker head of u s equity strategy at ubs companies have confirmed that view in its earnings report last month darden restaurants the parent company of olive garden noted that consumers were splurging adding to their entrees and buying up right now we think the consumer is in a really good place eugene lee darden s chief executive said on a conference call after the company s earnings release still stock market moves typically lead consumer sentiment meaning december s sharp sell off could take some of the fizz out of the mood of american shoppers even after a recovery in the early days of 2019 the s p 500 remains more than 10 per cent below its september peak the federal shutdown could also dampen spirits previous episodes of government dysfunction such as the 2011 fight over raising the debt ceiling and the 2013 government shutdown were associated with sharp drops in consumer confidence what s the impact of rising wages and other costs for large employers rising wages will cut into profits unless they find a way to get customers to pay higher prices a plan by amazon to pay a 15 hourly wage to its 250 000 employees in the united states as well as roughly 100 000 seasonal workers is expected to take a significant chunk out of its profits in november tjx companies the parent of retailers like marshalls t j maxx and homegoods all of which appeal to consumers because they keep prices low also offered cautious guidance for the fourth quarter in the face of rising labor and shipping costs wages aren t the only things rising increasing commodity prices transportation costs and interest rates are typical conundrums for corporations in latter stages of an economic expansion the emergence of those pressures on corporate profits is one reason investors have grown increasingly worried about stocks will executives sit on their hands executives don t mind paying more for wages raw materials and shipping if sales keep rising as the economy continues to grow but if the outlook darkens executives will be quick to snap their wallets shut the u s economy still looks strong more than 300 000 jobs were created in december unemployment remains below 4 percent through the third quarter the economy was on track for its best annual performance since 2005 still uncertainty about what s to come could dissuade some decision makers from pulling the trigger on new investments in real estate plants and equipment such capital spending is crucial to keeping the economic expansion on track making any broad pause in spending a potential pitfall for growth there are signs that the outlook is becoming increasingly murky while reporting earnings wednesday homebuilder lennar said it couldn t offer investors a forecast for 2019 because of continued softness and uncertainty in the housing market which has been squeezed by rising mortgage rates such comments as well as any mentions of plans to delay production or expansion plans will be of intense interest to investors this earnings season both for the individual companies involved and for the possible impact of those decisions on the u s economy that could itself lead to a future slowdown said maneesh deshpande head of u s equity strategy at barclays

patient approach to further interest rate increases the minutes of the fed s december meeting said participants saw the appropriate extent and timing of future rate hikes as less clear than earlier said the fed decided to raise rates by a quarter point at the meeting but the minutes suggest volatility in financial markets and increased concerns about global economic growth have clouded the outlook for rates against this backdrop many participants expressed the view that especially in an environment of muted inflation pressures the committee could afford to be patient about further policy firming the minutes said a number of participants noted it was important for the fomc to assess the impact of increasingly pronounced risks and the effects of past rate hikes before making further changes to the stance of monetary policy the patient approach espoused by the minutes is similar to remarks powell made during a joint discussion with former fed chairs janet yellen and ben

discussed in this essay destined for war can america and china escape thucydidesâ s trap by graham allison houghton mifflin harcourt 400 pages 16 99 red flags why xiâ s china is in jeopardy by george magnus yale university press 248 pages 26 asiaâ s reckoning china japan and the fate of u s power in the pacific century by richard mcgregor viking 432 pages 18 rethinking chinaâ s rise a liberal critique by xu jilin translated by david ownby cambridge university press 248 pages 99 99 within about fifteen years chinaâ s economy will surpass americaâ s and become the largest in the world as this moment approaches meanwhile a consensus has formed in washington that china poses a significant threat to american interests and well â being general joseph dunford the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff jcs has said that â china probably poses the greatest threat to our nation by about 2025 â the summary of americaâ s 2018 national defense strategy claims that china and russia are â revisionist powersâ seeking to â shape a world consistent with their authoritarian modelâ gaining veto authority over other nationsâ economic diplomatic and security decisions â christopher wray the fbi director has said â one of the things weâ re trying to do is view the china threat as not just a whole â of â government threat but a whole â of â society threatâ and i think itâ s going to take a whole â of â society response by us â so widespread is this notion that when donald trump launched his trade war against china in january 2018 he received support even from moderate figures such as democratic senator chuck schumer two main currents are driving these concerns one is economic that china has undermined the us economy by pursuing unfair trade practices demanding technology transfers stealing intellectual property and imposing non â tariff barriers that impede access to chinese markets the other current is political that chinaâ s successful economic development has not been accompanied by the liberal democratic reform western governments and particularly the united states had expected and that china has become too aggressive in its dealing with other nations reading about the imminent threat american officials believe china poses it is not hard to see why graham allison in his book destined for war reaches the depressing conclusion that armed conflict between the two countries is more likely than not yet since china is not mounting a military force to threaten or invade the united states not trying to intervene in americaâ s domestic politics and not engaged in a deliberate campaign to destroy the american economy we must consider that in spite of the increasing clamor about the threat china poses to the united states it is still possible for america to find a way to deal peaceably with a china that will become the number one economic and possibly geopolitical power within a decadeâ and to do so in a way that advances its own interests even as it constrains chinaâ s america must first reconsider a long â held belief about chinaâ s political system since the collapse of the soviet union american policymakers have been convinced that it would only be a matter of time before the chinese communist party ccp followed the soviet communist party into the political grave politicians and policymakers on both ends of the political spectrum accepted implicitly or explicitly the famous thesis of francis fukuyama that there was only one historical road to follow what we may be witnessing is not just the end of the cold war or the passing of a particular period of postwar history but the end of history as such that is the end point of mankindâ s ideological evolution and the universalization of western liberal democracy as the final form of human government when bill clinton explained in march 2000 why he supported chinaâ s admission to the world trade organization he stressed that political liberation would inevitably flow from economic liberalization concluding that â if you believe in a future of greater openness and freedom for the people of china you ought to be for this agreement â his successor george w â bush shared the same conviction in his 2002 national security strategy he wrote â in time china will find that social and political freedom is the only source of that national greatness â hillary clinton was more explicit according to her by persisting with communist party rule the chinese â are trying to stop history which is a foolâ s errand they cannot do it but theyâ re going to hold it off as long as possible â it is worth considering the conviction of american policymakers that they could so confidently dispense political prescriptions to china no other empire of course has accumulated as much economic political and military power as the united states has yet it has still been less than 250 years since the declaration of independence was signed in 1776 china by contrast is considerably older and the chinese people have learned from several thousand years of history that they suffer most when the central government is weak and divided as it was for almost a century after the opium war of 1842 when the country was ravaged by foreign invasions civil wars famines and much else besides since 1978 however china has lifted 800â million people out of poverty and created the largest middle class in the world as graham allison wrote in an op â ed for china daily an enâ glish â language newspaper owned by the chinese government â it could be argued that 40 years of miracle growth have created a greater increase in human well â being for more individuals than occurred in the previous more than 4 000 years of chinaâ s history â all this has happened while the ccp has been in power and the chinese did not fail to notice that the collapse of the soviet communist party led to a decline in russian life expectancy increase in infant mortality and plummeting incomes in american eyes the contest between americaâ s and chinaâ s political systems is one between a democracy where the people freely choose their government and enjoy freedom of speech and of religion and an autocracy where the people have no such freedoms to neutral observers however it could just as easily be seen as a choice between a plutocracy in the united states where major public policy decisions end up favoring the rich over the masses and a meritocracy in china where major public policy decisions made by officials chosen by party elites on the basis of ability and performance have resulted in such a striking alleviation of poverty one fact cannot be denied in the past thirty years the median income of the american worker has not improved between 1979 and 2013 median hourly wages rose just 6â percentâ less than 0 2â percent per year this doesnâ t mean that the chinese political system should remain in its current form forever human rights violationsâ such as the detention of hundreds of thousands of uighursâ remain a major concern within china today there are many voices calling for reforms among them is the prominent liberal scholar xu jilin and in rethinking chinaâ s rise a liberal critique david ownby has produced an excellent enâ glish translation of eight essays xu has written over the past decade xu lodges his sharpest criticisms against his fellow chinese scholars and especially against what he sees as their excessive focus on the nation â state and insistence on chinaâ s essential cultural and historical difference from western political models he argues that this overemphasis on particularism in fact marks a departure from traditional chinese culture which as exemplified by its historical tianxia model of foreign relations was a universal and open system criticizing the blanket rejection by â extreme nationalistsâ among his chinese academic peers of â anything created by westerners â xu argues instead that china has historically succeededâ because it was open however not even a liberal like xu would call for china to replicate the american political system instead he argues that china should â employ her own cultural traditions â through promoting a â new tianxiaâ on the domestic front â han people and the various national minorities will enjoy mutual equality in legal and status terms and the cultural uniqueness and pluralism of the different nationalities will be respected and protected â while its relations with other countries â will be defined by the principles of respect for each otherâ s sovereign independence equality in their treatment of each other and peaceful coexistence â chinaâ s political system will have to evolve with its social and economic conditions and in many respects it has evolved significantly becoming much more open than it once was when i first went to china in 1980 for instance no chinese were allowed to travel overseas as private tourists last year roughly 134â million traveled overseas and roughly 134â million chinese returned home freely similarly millions of the best young chinese minds have experienced the academic freedom of american universities yet in 2017 eight in ten chinese students chose to return home though the question remains if things have been going well why is xi imposing tighter political discipline on communist party members and removing term limits his predecessor hu jintao delivered spectacular economic growth but this period was also marked by a spike in corruption and party factionalism led by bo xilai the chongqing party secretary who tried to challenge xiâ s rise to power and zhou yongkang the powerful domestic security chief under xiâ s predecessor xi believed these trends would delegitimize the ccp and end chinaâ s successful rejuvenation against these dire challenges he saw no realistic alternative to reimposing strong central leadership despite doing this or because he did this xi remains hugely popular many in the west have been alarmed by the enormous power xi has accumulated taking it as a harbinger of armed conflict xiâ s accumulation of power however has not fundamentally changed chinaâ s long â term geopolitical strategy the chinese have for instance avoided unnecessary wars unlike the united states which is blessed with two nonthreatening neighbors in canada and mexico china has difficult relations with a number of strong nationalistic neighbors including india japan south korea and vietnam quite remarkably of the five permanent members of the un security council china france russia the united states and the united kingdom china is the only one among them that has not fired a single military shot across its border in thirty years since a brief naval battle between china and vietnam in 1988 by contrast even during the relatively peaceful obama administration the american military dropped twenty six thousand bombs on seven countries in a single year evidently the chinese understand well the art of strategic restraint there have of course been moments when china seemed close to war richard mcgregorâ s book asiaâ s reckoning which focuses on the strategic relationship between the united states china and japan since the postwar period vividly documents the precarious moments between china and japan since 2012 after japanese prime minister yoshihiko noda â nationalizedâ the disputed senkaku islands in september 2012 chinese and japanese naval vessels came perilously close to each other yet while many seasoned observers predicted a military clash between the two countries in 2014 none came to pass much has been made of the possibility of conflict in the south china sea through which roughly one fifth of all global shipping passes each year and where the chinese have converted isolated reefs and shoals into military installations as part of larger contested claims to sovereignty over portions of the waters but contrary to western analyses china while undeniably more politically assertive in the region has not become more aggressive militarily the smaller rival claimants to sovereignty in the south china sea including malaysia the philippines and vietnam control a number of islands in the waters china could easily dislodge them it has not done so when considering the familiar narrative of chinese aggression in the south china sea it must be remembered that the united states itself has missed opportunities to defuse tensions there a former us ambassador to china j stapleton roy told me that in a joint press conference with president obama on september 25 2015 xi jinping not only proposed an approach to the south china sea that included the endorsement of declarations supported by all ten members of the association of southeast asian nations but more significantly added that china had no intention of militarizing the spratly islands where it had engaged in massive reclamation work on the reefs and shoals it occupied yet the obama administration made no effort to pursue chinaâ s reasonable proposal instead the us navy stepped up its patrols in response china increased the pace of its construction of defensive installations on the islands just as careful diplomacy is required in military matters it is also integral to americaâ s economic relations with china virtually no well â known mainstream economist agrees with trump or his top trade adviser peter navarro and trade representative robert lighthizer that americaâ s trade deficits are the result of unfair practices by other countries martin feldstein the former chairman of ronald reaganâ s council of economic advisers has pointed out that americaâ s global trade deficit is due to the fact that its consumption outweighs its domestic production imposing tariffs on low â cost chinese goods will not rectify this structural feature but will serve only to make many essential goods less affordable to ordinary americans trumpâ s trade war against china has nevertheless won him broad mainstream support this is a result of a major mistake that china has made it has ignored growing perceptions and complaints including by leading american figures that china has been fundamentally unfair in many of its economic policies â the us has a strong caseâ against china in â alleg that china persists with discriminatory policies that favour local companies and penalise foreign firms â as george magnus notes in red flags â recommending that the united states engage china in a dialogue to encourage the latter to open up â market access in non â politically sensitive commercial and service â producing sectorsâ through avenues such as the usâ china comprehensive economic dialogue magnusâ s suggestion of dialogue through existing institutions is a far wiser route for america to take than trumpâ s trade war if the trump administration were to focus its economic campaign against china on the areas of these unfair practices it would generate a great deal of global support for this campaign indeed the wto provides many avenues to do so conceivably china may also privately acknowledge mistakes made in these areas and alter its policies however there is a growing perception in china and beyond that the real goal of the trump administration is not just to eliminate these unfair trade practices but to undermine or thwart chinaâ s long â term plan to become a technological leader in its own right although the united states has the right to implement policies to prevent the theft of its technology as martin feldstein has indicated this should not be conflated with its efforts to thwart chinaâ s long â term state â led industrial plan made in china 2025 designed to make china a global competitor in advanced manufacturing focusing on industries like electric cars advanced robotics and artificial intelligence both feldstein and magnus agree that in order to maintain supremacy in high â tech industries like aerospace and robotics the us government rather than pursuing tariffs should invest in areas such as higher education and research and development in short america needs to develop its own long â term economic strategy to match that of china in both policy and rhetoric it is clear to see that chinaâ s leadership has a vision for its economy and people plans like made in china 2025 and the infrastructure projects undertaken in the belt and road initiative bri such as the construction of high speed railways demonstrate chinaâ s efforts to become a global competitor in new advanced industries at the same time chinaâ s leaders have emphasized that the country can no longer pursue gdp growth at the expense of social costs such as inequality and environmental pollution this xi made clear when he declared in 2017 that the principal contradiction facing chinese society is now â between unbalanced and inadequate development and the peopleâ s ever â growing needs for a better life â as magnus sums it up this means a shift in focus to â improving the environment and pollution lowering income and regional inequality and strengthening the social safety net â although as magnus writes chinaâ s economy faces several important challenges chinaâ s leaders have at the very least taken steps to address them it is time for the united states to do the same however to work out a long â term strategy america needs to resolve a fundamental contradiction in its economic assumptions most sophisticated american economists believe that government â led industrial policies do not work arguing instead for free market capitalism if this american belief is correct trumpâ s main trade negotiator robert lighthizer should not oppose chinaâ s 2025 government â led plan to upgrade its technological capabilities lighthizer should sit back and allow this chinese industrial initiative to fail as the soviet unionâ s economic plans did however if lighthizer believes that the 2025 plan could succeed he should consider the possibility that america should revisit its ideological assumptions and like china formulate a long â term comprehensive economic strategy to match the chinese plan even germany arguably the worldâ s leading industrial power has such a strategy called industry 4 0 itâ s obviously less intrusive than the chinese version of industrial policy which as scott kennedy of the center for strategic and international studies has described involves the state playing â a significant role in providing an overall framework utilizing financial and fiscal tools and supporting the creation of manufacturing innovation centers â why canâ t the united states formulate a plan to match ironically the best country that the united states could work with in formulating such a long â term economic strategy might well be china china is keen to deploy its 3â trillion reserves to invest more in the united states adam posen the head of the influential peterson institute for international economics has already noted that trumpâ s trade war with china and the rest of the world has led net foreign investment in the united states to fall to nearly zero in 2018 america should also consider participating in chinaâ s belt and road initiative the chinese governmental program launched in 2013 to strengthen regional economic cooperation in asia europe and africa through massive investments in infrastructure the countries currently participating in bri would welcome us participation as it would help balance chinaâ s influence in short there are many economic opportunities america could take advantage of just as boeing and ge two major american corporations have benefited from the explosion in the chinese aviation market firms like caterpillar and bechtel could benefit from the massive construction undertaken in the bri region unfortunately americaâ s ideological aversion to state â led economic initiatives will prevent both mutually beneficial long â term economic cooperation with china and needed industrial strategies in the united states as china rises america faces two stark choices first should it continue with its current mixed bag of policies toward china with some seeking to enhance bilateral relations and others effectively undermining them on the economic front with the exception of trumpâ s latest trade war with china american policies have consistently treated china as a partner while americaâ s political and especially military policies have most often treated china as an adversary second can the united states match china and develop an equally effective long â term strategic plan to manage the latterâ s rise the simple answer is yes however if china is to be americaâ s number one strategic priority as it should be the obvious question is whether america can be as strategically disciplined as china and give up its futile wars in the islamic world and its unnecessary vilification of russia it was rational for the united states to have the worldâ s largest defense budget when its economy dwarfed every other in the world would it be rational for the worldâ s number â two economy to have the worldâ s largest defense budget and if america refuses to give this up isnâ t it a strategic gift to china china learned one major lesson from the collapse of the soviet union economic growth must come before military expenditure hence it would actually serve chinaâ s long â term interests for the united states to burn money away on unnecessary military expenses if america finally changes its strategic thinking about china it will also discover that it is possible to develop a strategy that will both constrain china and advance us interests bill clinton provided the wisdom for this strategy in a speech at yale university in 2003 when he said in short that the only way to manage the next superpower is to create multilateral rules and partnerships that would tie it down for example though china lays claim to reefs and shoals in the south china sea the un law of the sea convention has prevented it from declaring the entire south china sea an internal chinese lake china has also been obliged to implement wto judgments that have gone against it international rules do have bite fortunately under xi jinping china is still in favor of strengthening the global multilateral architecture the united states created including the international monetary fund the world bank the united nations and the wto china has contributed more un peacekeepers than the four other permanent members of the un security council combined hence there is a window of opportunity for cooperation between america and china in multilateral forums to seize the opportunity american policymakers have to accept the undeniable reality that the return of china and india is unstoppable why not from the year 1 to 1820 china and india had the worldâ s two largest economies the past two hundred years of western domination of global commerce have been an aberration as pricewaterhousecoopers has predicted china and india will resume their number one and two position by 2050 or earlier the leaders of both china and india understand that we now live in a small interdependent global village threatened by many new challenges including global warming both china and india could have walked away from the paris agreement after trump did so both chose not to despite their very different political systems both have decided that they can be responsible global citizens perhaps this may be the best route to find out if china will emerge as a threat to the united states and the world if it agrees to be constrained by multiple global rules and partnerships china could very well remain a different polityâ â that is not a liberal democracyâ â and still not be a threatening one this is the alternative scenario that the â china threatâ industry in the united states should consider and work toward

source imgflip dividend growth stocks are the most time tested and proven way of building wealth over time not just do they tend to beat the stock market itself the best performing asset class in history over time but they do so with lower volatility that s because income investors including retirees looking to live off dividends are more long term focused and as long as a company s payout is safe and growing are less prone to panic selling during inevitable downturns trailing total returns vs s p 500 by strategy source ploutos research that historical outperformance is not a trick of cherry picking time frames either as you can see dividend growth stocks have continued to outperform the s p 500 over all time frames that includes the most severe correction in the last 10 years but while market beating total returns are great for investors like myself 32 years old who have long time horizons high yield stocks are what many older investors near retirement or already retired are looking for fortunately the world of reits offers a way to combine high yield to pay the bills during your golden years with inflation beating long term income growth this allows you to not just preserve your buying power over time but also grow it as well as your overall nest egg s size my goal is always to point out great long term income growth opportunities to my readers iron mountain nyse irm is one of my favorite high yield picks right now which i consider a solid sleep well at night or swan stock for most people no matter what your primary goals are total returns or current income or both that s because this 7 1 yielding industry blue chip the biggest in the world at what it does has several great attributes that make it a fine choice for anyone seeking safe and growing recession proof income and thanks to a highly attractive valuation and long term growth runway as well as a top notch management team to execute on it iron mountain is also likely to deliver strong long term dividend growth that will likely result in about 14 total returns in the coming years this is why i not just own iron mountain in my own retirement account but also in my new deep value dividend growth portfolio this is a portfolio of my top dividend growth stock recommendations at any given time and is 100 focused on low risk swan stocks that are capable of delivering 13 long term total returns the portfolio is beating the market by 8 3 since inception so let s take a look at the four reasons 7 1 yielding iron mountain a retiree dream stock as well as one of the best long term high yield investments you can make today no matter your time horizon 1 a wide moat recession proof business model while it didn t become a reit until 2014 iron mountain traces its roots back to 1951 that s when it began its physical document storage business serving new york city based corporations over the past 68 years the company has built itself into the world s largest document storage business serving more than 225 000 customers including 95 of the fortune 1000 in 54 countries on all six inhabited continents via over 1 400 storage facilities source irm investor presentation today 63 of the reit s revenues are still from storing physical documents and for good reason this industry may be boring but it s also highly recession resistant and high margin in fact iron mountain s customer retention rate is 98 per year and 51 of boxes placed into its facilities 15 years ago still remain in storage and generating revenue source irm investor presentation the reason for this super low turnover is because according to morningstar s eric compton the average price per month for storing a cubic foot of documents for customers is a measly 0 10 0 22 box retrieval costs a one time fee of 1 65 2 77 per cubic foot and there is also a handling fee of 0 53 0 83 per cubic foot this basically means that a corporation s storage costs are so low compared to the cost of moving a box to a rival that few both to do so even during economic downturns when cost savings become a primary goal document storage is an insignificant expense for most companies that advantage is further strengthened by most of its contracts stipulating a maximum monthly withdrawal rate which means that even if a company wanted to switch storage providers it would take a long time to do so however because iron mountain maintains an industry leading document data accuracy rate of 99 99999 very few customers have an incentive to try to switch legal requirements in various industries require physical document backup storage what s more the company enjoys one of the widest moats in all of reitdom this is because after decades of consolidating the global document storage market no one can match irm for its supply and logistics capabilities that includes the pick up and delivery network it s spent billions building which allows it to charge less than its smaller peers while still retaining industry leading profitability source irm investor presentation that profitability keeps rising steadily despite the reit s rapid diversification into non storage business lines such as services shredding data security and data centers this is courtesy of iron mountain s unbeatable economies of scale which allow the company to spread out its fixed costs over its rapidly growing and contracted revenue and don t be fooled by the reit s weak stock price performance over the past few years iron mountain is enjoying some of the best growth rates in all of reitdom metric q3 2018 ytd 2018 revenue growth 9 8 10 9 adjusted ebitda growth 12 7 15 6 adjusted funds from operation growth 9 0 13 7 affo share 1 1 5 3 dividend growth yoy 4 0 6 9 affo payout ratio 76 6 74 3 click to enlarge sources company earnings release earnings supplement gurufocus even factoring in 8 share dilution over the past 12 months like all reits irm sells new shares to partially fund its growth affo the reit equivalent of free cash flow and what funds the dividend share is up 5 3 what s more management recently raised its top and bottom line growth guidance for 2018 and by a significant amount revenue growth 9 11 up from 7 9 affo growth 13 16 up from 5 13 analysts expect that this year s strong results will result in affo share rising by 7 in line with its growth rates of previous years source f a s t graphs analysts also expect as do i that irm s affo share will continue growing at roughly this pace for not just the next few years but over the next decade now that might come as a surprise to investors who are worried about the long term secular decline of physical storage in developed markets like the us and the eu in fact the decline in developed market storage volumes is the primary reason why one analyst recently downgraded the stock and it s true that in developed country markets physical storage volume is starting to shrink with document destruction rates now overtaking new document inflows source irm earnings supplement irm s developed market net storage growth has been falling at a steady though very slow pace for three quarters but as cfo stuart brown pointed out in the latest conference call thanks to good revenue management such as price hikes developed market storage revenue still grew by 0 7 in q3 meanwhile its overseas document storage volumes have been growing at a fast and accelerating rate because management expects the weakness in developed market storage volumes to continue for the next few years it s been actively acquiring fast growing storage businesses overseas and in the past year has made acquisitions in croatia china philippines south korea today 14 of irm s revenue is from emerging markets in asia and latin america but its steady acquisitions in those markets will help the company to substantially grow its international diversification source iron mountain investor presentation the reit s services business revenue think document scanning and shredding is booming up 10 1 in the first 3 quarters of 2018 this is why even adjusting for currency fluctuations irm s total storage revenue in the first nine months of 2018 grew 3 6 and 4 2 in q3 when volume declines were the highest in years and as its cfo explained to analysts during the last cc iron mountain is well situated to deal with even much faster volume declines in its developed markets if we had a global volume net decline as large as 1 of total volume or 7 million cubic feet which is 10 times larger than anything we ve experienced if you assume the volume decrease comes from a combination of fewer incoming boxes and increased destructions the revenue lost from the fewer incoming boxes would be largely offset by an increase in destruction related fees even before any paper revenue in summary we remain on track to continue strengthening our balance sheet while funding our targeted dividend increases such as that announced this morning we expect our strong cash flow generation to enable us to fund dividend increases while improving our affo payout ratio iron mountain cfo emphasis added the bottom line is that iron mountain isn t worried about its core document storage business in developed markets while this source of highly recession resistant cash flow is likely to eventually decline over the long term the reit s long term growth plan remains firmly on track that plan calls for steady dividend growth deleveraging the balance sheet to eventually achieve an investment grade credit rating and is ultimately the biggest reason i m such a fan of this high yield reit 2 great long term growth strategy supports safe dividend growth and deleveraging plan all companies can come up with great sounding long term growth plans but ultimately it s quality management that counts an experienced executive team that is capable of smart capital allocation is the key difference between promising a wonderful future and actually delivering on it iron mountain s strong management team is led by ceo william meaney he took over the top job at irm in january 2013 and has been responsible for overseeing the reit s strong cash flow and dividend growth since then before irm meaney was ceo of the zuellig group a 12 billion hong kong based business to business conglomerate for eight years over his tenure zuellig s revenues tripled a key reason zuellig hired meaney was because of his strong global connections which stem from serving as chief commercial officer and managing director of swiss international airlines 2002 2004 and before that he served as executive vice president of south african airways for three years he s also a member of the asia business council giving him strong business connections in irm s largest and fastest growing market meaney s skill isn t in just rapidly consolidating overseas storage businesses and thus recreating irm s historical business model in fast growing emerging markets it s also in diversifying into other fast growing business lines such as data security cloud computing and services source irm investor presentation irm already operates in 12 data center markets around the world including in some of the fastest growing markets 9 top us markets and 3 international ones the reit s long term goal is to serve both america s and the world s top 10 data center markets total market expansion to 20 cities the data center business has been steadily built up through acquisitions over the past year and today irm has 103 mw of data center capacity that s expandable to 289 mw basically tripling in size in the future from organic capex investment occupancy is 91 1 with over 1 100 corporate clients and average remaining leases of 3 5 years despite this being a new business for the company and still relatively small global adjusted ebitda data margins are already 44 and expected to climb in the future improving economies of scale iron mountain is targeting long term 10 13 rates of return on invested capital in data centers which is similar to what it enjoys in physical storage in other words data centers are not a way of sacrificing profitability for growth but a good strategic choice for the company to leverage its current business model into strong growth in the coming years and decades source irm investor presentation that s because iron mountain s data center business shares many of the appealing characteristics of its storage business including high retention rates low capex and very high ebitda margins why does irm think it can compete in data centers when it s the new kid on the block this is because of meaney s global b2b connections and the reit s decades long relationships with its global corporate clients iron cloud is the reit s new data protection and retrieval platform and the reit s trusted brand literally the best in the industry has allowed its data center business to grow quickly from nothing a few years ago to 5 of revenue today data security is another 12 by 2020 irm expects that 10 of all cash flow will be coming from data centers source irm investor presentation combined with the fast growing overseas storage business iron mountain is building its long term growth on a portfolio of businesses that is seeing double digit revenue growth more than three times that of its mature core business this is why irm isn t worried about slowing growth in developed storage because the company believes its growth initiatives are still on track to actually accelerate overall revenue growth by 2020 while ever improving economies of scale will allow annual cash flow growth to accelerate by about 20 to help fund its growth goals iron mountain has a few sources of capital there s steadily rising retained cash flow from a falling payout ratio modest amounts of new debt designed to still allow deleveraging accretive equity issuances and capital recycling source irm investor presentation that last strategy simply means that the company will periodically and opportunistically sell properties when it can achieve an annualized rate of return of 15 on its investment what does iron mountain s grand strategic vision which it s executing on very strongly thanks to great management ultimately mean for income investors source irm earnings presentation how about close to 7 revenue growth double digit affo growth and a steadily growing dividend and at 4 payout growth irm plans to use its rapidly growing cash flow to deleverage its balance sheet from a leverage ratio defined by its creditors of 5 6 to 5 0 by 2020 and over the long term management expects to lower the leverage ratio to about 4 75 but possibly to 4 5 all but ensuring an investment grade credit rating see risk section source iron mountain investor presentation as for irm s dividend safety that will be enhanced by the stronger balance sheet and an affo payout ratio that s expected to fall to 73 note that at the start of 2018 the company was guiding for a full year affo payout ratio of 81 in the last 12 months it s actually been 80 and management now believes its increased guidance will put the company under 80 for 2018 basically despite what the stock s recent price crash may lead you to believe irm isn t some flailing yield trap with an unsustainable and unsafe dividend that s almost certain to be cut rather it s a thriving cash rich and wide moat business with a top quality management team that consistently over delivers on its already impressive growth plans this in turn creates a highly attractive dividend profile that promises not just generous safe and steadily rising dividends in the future but also mouth watering total returns that are far superior to what the market is likely to deliver 3 dividend profile safe generous and growing yield plus market beating total return potential the most important part of any income investing is the dividend profile which consists of the yield payout safety and long term growth

and far above the reit median of 5 3 that s thanks mostly to market fears over the developed market storage business not justified and its junk bond credit rating somewhat justified see the risk section for a detailed explanation the actual dividend though is safe thanks to a modest payout ratio the reit average is 80 that s steadily falling over time and don t forget that irm s cash flow is still coming mostly from its core and recession resistant business but a good payout ratio is just one half of the dividend safety equation the other half is the balance sheet and this is irm s

egregious by reit norms nor is the interest coverage ratio particularly troubling source irm earnings supplement and irm is nowhere near violating its debt covenants those are credit metric levels it must maintain otherwise creditors can call in its loans right away and cause a liquidity crisis debt covenant violations are a primary reason reits are forced to cut their dividends deteriorating cash flow is the other big one as i explain in great detail in the risk section the reason for irm s junk bond rating likely has to do with its growth strategy since becoming a reit in 2014 as a reit it must pay out 90 of taxable net income not the same as gaap eps or affo as a dividend thus like all reits irm has to use a lot of leverage as well as equity issuances in order to grow despite being 68 years old as a reit it is still relatively young and while the company s cash flow and dividend growth has been impressive over the past four years credit rating agencies have taken a poor view of its large use of low interest junk bonds to fund much of it while irm plans to reduce its leverage over time the pace of that reduction has thus far angered the rating agencies especially moody s which wish it would prioritize deleveraging above growth projects and dividend increases management s actual strategy is longer term and incorporates the fact that steady cash flow and dividend growth and falling leverage over time is critical to maintaining a strong share price and low enough cost of equity to achieve its long term growth ambitions in the hands of a less skilled management team i might be skeptical of the reit s ability to achieve its long term targets while paying a safe dividend but irm has consistently met or beaten its guidance over the years and so i m confident that it will be able to navigate its challenges and risks going forward to deliver a safe and steadily rising payout the dividend growth rate is currently 4 and management expects to maintain that rate through 2020 eventually once the payout ratio falls low enough 70 75 and the reit gets an investment grade credit rating payout growth is likely to track affo share growth analysts currently expect 5 6 long term 10 year cash flow growth which i consider a reasonable estimate even assuming zero valuation improvement that growth rate combined with the current yield is enough to deliver nearly 13 long term total returns given that the s p 500 has historically generated 9 2 cagr total returns and is likely to deliver between 5 and 9 vanguard thinks 5 8 is most likely in the next few years iron mountain looks like an extremely attractive high yield income growth investment and when we consider its current valuation and the valuation boost that successful execution on its growth plan would likely represent then irm s investment thesis gets even stronger 4 valuation a good margin of safety for this low risk stock irm total return price data by ycharts thanks to two corrections in 2018 including the most recent 19 8 decline investors in general haven t had much reason to cheer the past year courtesy of high yields reits and irm did manage to beat the market though 12 month total returns remain negative however long term value focused income investors are actually happy to see such charts because for rapidly growing businesses like irm it means highly attractive valuations p 2018 affo historical p affo growth baked into current price analyst long term growth forecast 11 4 12 5 2 0 5 6 click to enlarge sources f a s t graphs benjamin graham today iron mountain trades at just 11 4 times affo p affo is the reit equivalent of a p e ratio that s below its average ratio since becoming a reit and the 15 5 that most reits trade for since its reit conversion irm has traded at a significant discount to most reits largely due to concerns over the credit rating and fears over the physical storage business s future the reit s actual fundamentals cash flow and dividends have been moving steadily higher and at one of the sector s fastest rates indicating it s spent most of the past four years undervalued irm s current cash flow multiple implies a 2 long term growth rate which is nearly three times slower than what analysts expect and 3 5 times slower than 2018 s expected affo share growth rate this means the company is likely facing significant multiple expansion if management delivers on its long term plans and a stronger balance sheet reduces its biggest risk factor how much of a valuation boost are we talking about for that i turn to my favorite valuation method for high yield dividend stocks dividend yield theory or dyt this is the exclusive method that asset manager newsletter publisher investment quality trends has used since 1966 to deliver market beating total returns with 10 less volatility for decades source investment quality trends dyt works by comparing a stock s yield to its historical norm unless the investment thesis breaks yields tend to mean revert or return to relatively stable levels that approximate fair value yield 5 year average yield 8 year median yield estimated fair value yield 7 1 6 0 3 9 6 0 click to enlarge sources simply safe dividends gurufocus since irm shifted business models in 2014 i m using the higher and thus more conservative 5 year average yield which also includes the sector bear market and two corrections this is how i make a conservative fair value yield estimate of 6 meaning that irm should over time return to that yield as its fundamentals and risk profile improve note that if management succeeds in its long term plans then irm s actual fair value yield might end up decreasing closer to its historical median yield or to put it another way irm is at least 16 undervalued but potentially much more a fair p affo ratio for a reit growing at 5 6 is 17 9 fair value price discount to fair value upside to fair value long term cagr valuation boost valuation adjusted total return potential 40 67 16 19 1 7 14 4 click to enlarge sources simply safe dividends f a s t graphs dividend yield theory moneychimp but even using this conservative fair value estimate irm is worth 40 67 today this means that the reit would need to rise 19 just to get to fair value my valuation adjusted total return model based on dyt and the one brookfield asset management uses assumes a 10 year outlook in reality irm s return to fair value isn t likely to take a decade but even if it did then the share price would likely outpace cash flow and long term dividend growth by nearly 2 per year that valuation boost when added to the gordon dividend growth model effective since 1956 for stocks like these of total return yield long term cash flow dividend growth with valuation changes canceling out over time is how i reach my long term total return potential of 14 4 for a reit of this caliber with such a wide moat quality management team and strong long term outlook i d have no problem recommending the stock at fair value when its long term return potential would still be 12 7 but at a 16 discount to fair value i consider irm a strong buy today that is of course if you re comfortable with the company s risk profile risks to consider the biggest risk to any reit s growth plans is a rising cost of capital while irm has enjoyed low borrowing costs relative to its high rates of return on invested capital over the past few years rising interest rates and its junk bond credit rating are the biggest threat to management delivering on its long term plans why does irm despite a leverage ratio that s slightly below the sector norm suffer from a junk bond rating at all well that would likely be because it took on a lot of debt to make some big acquisitions in recent years moody s in particular wanted to see the reit focus like a laser on decreasing its leverage ratio but its 2020 growth plans require additional borrowing which means that leverage won t come down fast enough for moody s taste according to the rating agency s recent report on irm iron mountain s ba3 cfr bb s p equivalent reflects its elevated leverage that moody s expects to continue through 2020 while management has a stated target of improving leverage to 5x on its lease adjusted basis by 2020 the company s large funding requirements for dividends capital expenditures and acquisitions increase the risks to achieving this target the negative rating outlook reflects iron mountain s elevated leverage which moody s expects to decline slowly but likely remain near the mid 5x in 2019 moody s could downgrade iron mountain s ratings if the total debt to ebitda moody s adjusted does not decline and is expected to remain above the mid 5x or liquidity weakens materially given the high leverage and a negative outlook a rating upgrade is not expected in the near term moody s could upgrade iron mountain ratings if the company establishes a track record of deleveraging uses a meaningful amount of equity to fund its annual cash deficits and maintains good ebitda growth the rating could be upgraded if iron mountain could sustain total debt to ebitda below 4 5x moody s adjusted and retained cash flow to net debt approaches 10 moody s emphasis added as you can see moody s is basing on its own adjusted leverage ratio to drive most of its rating decision on irm because the 2020 plan doesn t deleverage the balance sheet sufficiently in its opinion over the next year the rating agency has a negative outlook on the debt and in order to upgrade this it would likely require several years of deleveraging on irm s part while the fast rising cash flow and falling payout ratio mean that the reit will have a larger ability to fund more growth internally in the future ultimately it will be somewhat at the mercy of the equity markets for raising accretive growth capital to fund its growth plans the good news is that there are two reasons why irm isn t likely to cut the dividend in order to deleverage faster first as moody s explains the company is dependent on equity financing like most reits the most irm is likely to be able to cut the dividend and retain reit status is about 40 how much cash flow would that free up about 280 million per year that s approximately one third of the reit s long term growth budget in other words cutting the dividend to the bone won t solve irm s growth funding issues equity raises are the answer via the reit s atm program however that only works if the cost of equity affo yield is below the cash yields on invested capital 10 13 depending on the investment right now irm s cost of equity is 8 8 meaning it can still issue new shares to fund profitable growth the cost of equity won t decrease with a dividend cut but the share price certainly would share price generally tracks dividend growth up and down thus a big dividend cut the max 40 would mean that irm s cost of equity could rise to about 12 3 due to a crashing share price basically this means that management knows the only way to an even lower risk business model with an investment grade credit rating is to deliver on its long term promises thus far its track record on execution is excellent and despite what a bb rating might imply the reit s debt levels are not posing a major short term risk to the dividend though it is still the biggest risk factor facing irm source irm earnings supplement irm s debt is mostly long term average maturity 6 3 years and fixed rate what s more the company has no major repayments coming up that might pose a risk to its 2020 growth plans but with 28 of its debt being variable actually 26 if you account for leases irm has relatively high exposure to short term interest rates 3 month libor based on us dollar data by ycharts its variable rate debt isn t tied to the fed funds rate or ffr directly but to libor which typically tracks the ffr closely over time the good news is that the bond futures market is now predicting the fed is done hiking rates in fact thanks to slowing economic growth and inflation expectations the bond market expects that there is roughly a 25 chance that the fed hikes rates at all in 2019 and a 25 chance that it will cut rates at least once this year and in 2020 the bond market thinks it s more likely than not that the fed will cut rates in order to stave off a recession a falling ffr would likely mean lower interest rates on its variable debt which would be a good thing but we can t forget that the bond futures market isn t god with infallible clairvoyance about the future rather it s constantly adjusting its estimates of future rate policy based on frequently changing economic and inflation data whose trends can change over time this means that if the us economy were to surprise to the upside in 2019 then the fed might indeed make good on its plans to hike the ffr three more times through 2020 that in turn could cause libor to rise by about 0 75 1 and possibly increase irm s effective interest rate to 5 1 now mind you that a slightly higher interest rate isn t going to threaten the dividend but it might cause affo share growth to come in below expectations and thus cause the reit to miss its 2020 plans the bigger potential risk is with irm s long term debt which remains firmly in the junk bond market for now in the past decade record low interest rates meant that the yield spread junk bond yield minus 10 year treasury yield was low by historical standards but there are two important things to know first treasury yields have now risen about 1 5 off their mid 2016 all time lows and should the economy surprise to the upside that might increase to 2 or more meanwhile junk bond yield spreads are not fixed but market based and thus are extremely volatile at times during periods of financial market turmoil such as the economic growth scare we re in now junk bond yield spreads can blowout and soar to very high levels this means that iron mountain faces the risk of potentially having to refinance some of its debt when the credit markets might demand a much higher interest rate than what it currently pays on its bonds this long term rate risk would be highest during a recession when demand for riskier debt would fall while a recession isn t likely in 2019 based on the most recent economic data and trends one is most likely to begin in mid 2020 to late 2020 depending on how long a recession lasts iron mountain might have to refinance close to 1 billion in junk bonds during 2021 and 2022 at what might be much higher interest rates this is why it s so crucial that the reit delivers on its deleveraging targets only an investment grade credit rating can substantially reduce the reit s long term interest rate sensitivity and thus minimize the chance of rising rates hindering management s ambitious growth plans including for its dividend bottom line iron mountain is a high yielding retiree dream stock and a strong buy today no company is perfect and neither is iron mountain with its junk bond credit rating representing the biggest risk factor to watch over time but ultimately i consider this industry blue chip s recession resistant and high margin core business to be a solid source of generous safe and rising dividends and with a world class management team leading an ambitious long term growth plan based on diversification into faster growing industries and so far overdelivering on those plans i m confident the company has a bright future since i m confident in management s deleveraging plan i m willing to assign iron mountain a swan rating no dividend cuts even during a recession which is why i not just own it in my real money retirement portfolio but in my new deep value dividend growth portfolio as well that s what i consider to be the best collection of dividend growth stocks for conservative income investors seeking generous safe and rising income as well as market beating double digit total returns of 13 thanks to its attractive valuation at least 16 undervalued iron mountain clears that hurdle nicely with about 14 4 long term expected total returns and with nearly half of that return coming in the form of safe and steadily rising dividends irm is a great choice not just for younger investors seeking to grow their wealth over time but also for retirees who need high current income to pay the bills during their golden years

singapore dec 31 with the us poised for a slowdown what does this mean for singapore s economy in 2019 morgan stanley economist deyi tan says it is inevitable that the city state will follow suit i think there is no avoiding the situation that singapore s gdp growth will also slow down but tan thinks the difference between 2019 and previous late phases of the economic cycle is that there could be some support from the property sector resulting from the spate of en bloc activity seen in the past few quarters construction has begun and this tends to filter into the construction capital expenditure numbers with a lag we think this would show up more evidently in the numbers next year she explains bank of america merrill lynch also thinks singapore will suffer in tandem with the global slowdown given its small and open economy the bank estimates that singapore s gdp growth will decline from 3 3 in 2018 to 2 8 in 2019 and 2 5 in 2020 nevertheless boaml notes that there are several defensive qualities to singapore s resilience advertisement for one the labour market has improved unemployment remains low and there is good wage growth in real terms policy buffers are substantial and support can be quickly rolled out if necessary says boaml singapore s cyclical sectors have also benefited from diversified sources of end demand although 67 of all value add created

manageable says dbs the bank estimates core inflation to peak in 2019 and subsequently ease towards about 1 5 in 2020 however the all item consumer price index series is expected to rise to 1 8 in 2019 from 0 7 this year this largely stems from a low base effect owing to declines in car prices arising from the supply glut in the secondary car market barring any supply side shock in the external environment inflationary pressure should remain subdued amid a slow growth scenario says dbs story continues dbs expects the monetary authority of singapore to keep normalising monetary policy in 2019 it notes that the scope for more normalisation is also reflected by the rise in the singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate sgd neer to the top of its policy band the singapore dollar policy first returned to a modest and gradual appreciation stance in april 2018 with a slight increase in the policy band this was followed by a similar back to back adjustment in october according to our

wti is expected to average 63 per barrel b in 2019 said the global outlook for h1 2019 by indosuez wealth management the global wealth management division of crédit agricole uae turning now to the uae we have already pointed to the slightly better public debt outlook when compared to the saudi case the implementation of new taxes such as tourism fees custom duties and vat should alleviate the emirates dependency on energy prices notably the imf expects the uae to deliver a primary surplus from 2018 on the report said however in terms of monetary policy there is not much divergence due to the peg of each currency to the usd with the federal reserve fed getting more restrictive and proceeding with several two in our forecast fed funds interest rate hikes next year the central bank of the uae had to adopt a tightening bias this far the bank has raised its repo rate to 2 5 per cent from 1 per cent at the beginning of 2017 in six steps of 25 basis points higher interest rates obviously do not help the real estate market prices of residential properties declined by 18 9 per cent between the november 2014 high and september 2018 in dubai prices fell by 20 8 per cent between october 2014 and september 2017 on top of the direct impact on the sectors of construction and real estate which weighed 13 4 per cent in the uae s gdp in 2017 there is an indirect effect on consumption due to the negative wealth effect at play curiously while consumer confidence as measured by the bayt com index has never been able to recover from its sharp decline from the end of 2012 the propensity to consume index did not reflect a significantly lower appetite for spending similarly the market purchasing manager s index remained firmly in expansion territory that is above the 50 boom bust line at 55 in october 2018 it is close to its long term average of 55 1 however the advent of protectionism did take its toll for example cargo volumes handled at dubai s airport have been threading water increasing by a meagre 1 9 per cent year on year in september 2018 tourism another pillar of dubai s economy did not expand that much and dubai international airport passenger traffic declined by 0 2 per cent between september 2017 and september 2018 extending a downward trend which started back towards the end of 2015 all in all real gdp growth should be positive this year but not outstanding inflation in the uae spiked to 4 8 per cent year on year in january 2018 due primarily to the introduction of a 5 per cent vat rate but has since begun to ease the september figure stood at 3 1 per cent year on year only it looks like the rate of change in consumer prices will moderate further in the coming months and the imf expects uae s inflation rate to average 3 5 per cent this year before easing to below 2 per cent all of this does not seem to be enough to change the debt outlook as assessed by the various rating agencies as a reminder the current moody s rating applied to abu dhabi long term debt is aa2 which means that the bonds are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk the report concluded saudi arabia an impressive reduction in saudi arabia s budget deficit occurred during the first 9 months of 2018 which happened despite a 25 per cent increase in government spending this is linked on one side to the rise of the oil price as the west texas intermediate wti price has averaged 67 per barrel so far in 2018 compared to 51 per barrel in 2017 on the other side non oil income also increased dramatically according to the government this reflects the effectiveness of economic reforms and fiscal measures targeting fiscal sustainability as well as the effective management of public finances the report said the government is targeting a fiscal deficit of 7 3 per cent of gdp this year and a balanced budget by 2023 according to the international monetary fund imf estimates a wti oil price close to 88 per barrel would be required to balance the 2018 budget despite this deficit reduction the debt to gdp ratio is set to rise over the coming years given a 3 3 per cent weighted average coupon for saudi bonds and a 2017 debt to nominal gdp ratio of 17 1 per cent the cost of servicing the debt amounts to 3 875 million 3 3 per cent x 17 1 per cent x 686 738 million per year deducting this amount from the 2018 projected total deficit 52 billion gives us the primary deficit that is roughly 48 billion or 6 7 per cent of gdp with such a deficit even the 17 8 per cent year on year yoy nominal gdp growth recorded in q2 2018 is not high enough to stabilise the debt to gdp ratio the latter could reach 24 2 per cent by 2023 imf fiscal monitor april 2018 we also note that the weight of debt in percent of gdp close to 20 per cent is not very different from that of its regional peer the united arab emirates uae however in contrast the uae s debt to gdp ratio is on a stabilising path that being said saudi arabia s government has been trying to reduce its dependency on oil revenue amongst the various measures to rebalance its budget it introduced a 5 per cent vat on 1 january 2018 it was no surprise that this plan had a negative impact on the business climate in the non oil sector as can be seen in the sharp decrease in the purchasing managers index pmi to an all time low of 51 4 in april 2018 nevertheless the pmi managed to stay above the 50 boom bust line and rebounded to 53 8 in october 2018 chart 10 obtaining the most up to date assessments of growth requires more frequent indicators than quarterly gdp figures alone for example oil prices atm withdrawals etc using these variables we now expect nominal gdp growth to slow down somewhat following the strong q2 figure with regards to inflation it is still impacted by the introduction of vat earlier this year and in september the cpi increased by 2 1 per cent yoy this base effect will dissipate next january to sum up the most recent saudi data suggests some kind of stabilisation but resisting the temptation to re expand government spending in line with higher oil prices will remain a challenge the report concluded tradearabia news service

regarding growth such concerns were driven by trade international economies or politics and some were market driven as volatility has increased and the yield curve has narrowed also he noted that some companies are still feeling hungover from the great recession and that s a real issue that is as the economy s numbers look strong but business sentiment has weakened considerably barking concluded that the united states faces a slower growth trend that isn t in any of our interests changing the slope is doable via initiatives to expand the workforce and boost productivity growth uk leadsom brexit plan b will be ready within days if the deal is voted down in uk andrea leadsom the leader of the house of commons said the government will set out its plan b should prime minister theresa may s brexit deal is voted down next week she told the parliament that the prime minister has shown her willingness to always return to this house at the first possible opportunity if there is anything to report in terms of our brexit deal and we will continue to do so meanwhile may s spokesman said she is still working on more assurances from the eu on the brexit deal in particular the irish backstop may still hope to convince mps to vote for the agreement on january 15 opposition labour leader jeremy corbyn said the party would vote against the deal and after that it s voted down an election must

thursday market open the question of the day is can the win streak reach five that might be a struggle judging from how things look early on all of that optimism about the china talks seems to be ebbing a little and there s no timetable for a next round meanwhile in corporate news shares of macy s nyse got crushed ahead of the opening bell after the retailer reported weak holiday results and cut its outlook on the other hand target nyse reported solid holiday sales as we say often the retail sector is really one of individual stories so it s probably best to look at it company by company however as of this morning the entire sector appeared to come under pressure wednesday s moderately higher close for the index spx marked the fourth straight day of gains the first time that s happened since a five session stretch ending last sept 14 though stocks closed off their highs they still managed to finish the day just above what might be a key level at 2584 from a technical standpoint the spx s ability to close above that mark could signal underlying strength some analysts believe take pause before calling a pause stocks rose wednesday afternoon after from december s federal open market committee fomc meeting showed fed officials indicating they might have more patience before raising rates further the fed news this week is far from over as fed chair jerome speaks today he s been out there a lot lately and frequently moves the market in a big way one direction or another when he talks his remarks today are scheduled for 12 45 p m et and that s not all fed vice chair richard delivers a speech called economic outlook and monetary policy tonight those certainly sound like topics investors might want to hear about from the fed clarida who only recently took the job has been sounding mainly dovish so far some media reports suggested the minutes were a sign of the fed being ready to pause on but that s arguably the wrong word to use as we noted here yesterday the fed is likely going to remain vigilant about inflation last week s looked like a bases clearing home run and another one like it perhaps accompanied by rising energy prices might have the fed dusting off its previous more hawkish assumptions for 2019 anyone who s lived through a few market cycles likely knows the wheel can spin quickly the fed s biggest fear probably remains inflation mainly because when inflation rises it tends to do so exponentially the fed typically wants to get out ahead of rising prices so don t be surprised if we re back here in a month or two wondering whether a rate hike might be ahead especially if goes above 60 a barrel and we have another good jobs report on our hands as a reminder crude rose for the eighth straight session wednesday and is back above 52 a barrel that s a more than 20 rise from the lows seen around christmas weaker dollar possible implications another thing the fed minutes seemed to do besides maybe helping give the stock market a lift was to put more support behind the weak dollar story the dollar index fell to near 95 late on wednesday the lowest level in three months typically rate hikes tend to prop up the currency of the country making them so it would stand to reason that the dollar would weaken if people expect the fed to stay dovish on the other hand a weaker dollar tends to also help lift commodity prices and not just for energy think about food for instance and other prices all could start getting support if the stays weak and that also could play into the inflation picture if it lasts a while speaking of which december consumer price index cpi data are due friday analysts expect a drop of 0 1 in the probably in part due to cheap gas prices which strips out energy and food is seen rising 0 2 according to briefing com getting back to the dollar a weaker greenback might help give multinational u s firms a lift though it s still a bit early to see an earnings impact for q4 more likely any benefits would start to seep into q1 earnings because the dollar stayed pretty strong through most of late 2018 we ll have to wait and see if this is just a pause in the dollar rally or perhaps something more prolonged sentiment shift on earnings it s a new year and maybe that means there s some new sentiment shaping up consider the case of homebuilder lennar nyse which reported on wednesday that its q4 beat wall street analysts expectations but revenue missed also the company declined to issue guidance citing uncertainty about the market last year when companies had any bad news at all they tended to get punished so when len shares fell right after the earnings it seemed to carry along the 2018 sentiment then later in the day len shares came back in a big way rising more than 9 at one point instead of punishing the stock it looks like at least some investors focused more on some of the positives in the company s earnings report and its call with analysts during the call len said it was seeing improvement in buyer traffic so far in its fiscal q1 as interest rates declined reuters reported this appeared to be one factor in the stock s rally and perhaps it indicates improved investor sentiment as earnings season approaches a similar situation developed right after the market closed wednesday when bed bath beyond nasdaq stock lifted off in post market trading following though it eased back after the macy s news the results were pretty much in line with wall street analysts expectations what seemed to get people excited was the company s fiscal 2019 net earnings guidance which it said would be similar to fiscal 2018 results so does this mean steady as she goes is now considered enough for a stock to rally last year it seemed like steady guidance or even slightly better guidance sent most companies to the woodshed this might be something to ponder in the days ahead in other corporate news early thursday ford nyse announced job cuts in europe as the company faces struggles in that market the company says its move is designed to improve profitability and reduce costs for investors the announcement could serve as a signal that the auto industry continues to face challenges and it also could be another sign of european economic softness meanwhile american airlines nasdaq shares slid in the pre market after the company cut guidance the aal news comes on the back of recent bad news from delta nyse and a major downgrade yesterday on united nasdaq clearly the airlines are having a tough time volatility backs off in another sign that sentiment might be changing the market s most closely watched fear index the edged below 20 on wednesday for the first time in a month before clawing back above that mark early thursday it had traded well above 30 in the week around christmas as waves of turbulence sent the market up and down like a paper boat in an atlantic hurricane wednesday s vix action put the cash price below the next three months of futures prices see chart below until recently the cash price had been above futures an unusual trend that in the case of vix had appeared to indicate high expectations for more near term volatility as of wednesday afternoon however the near term futures contract prices enjoyed a premium to cash perhaps suggesting that some investors expect relatively calmer times for the moment we ll have to wait and see figure 1 shifting curves hard to believe but it was a little over two weeks ago on christmas eve when a market meltdown pushed near term volatility to its highest levels since february yesterday the first few months of the vix term structure aka vix futures curve moved back to contango meaning nearer term vix futures vx are priced higher than the cash index the red line shows the futures curve on december 24 the yellow line shows it as of yesterday s close when the index settled at 19 98 data source cboe global markets chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade for illustrative purposes only past performance does not guarantee future results nice bun but not a lot of beef on trade this week brought plenty of positive headlines about trade talks but not a lot of specifics while it s always nice to hear that china is buying some u s products as it did recently by scooping up another load of the issues are far more complex than simple product trade it s unclear if the two countries can make progress on more complicated issues like intellectual property and technology transfers then there s the issue of what sort of compliance might be built into any deal china has made deals in the past but compliance is sometimes troublesome as u s commerce secretary wilbur ross pointed out in a televised interview a few days ago the trade talks ended wednesday in beijing markets appeared to get a shot in the arm as the talks occurred but the optimism started to fade by thursday a lot could hang on whether the two parties schedule another round or retreat to their separate corners for a while also investors might be looking for signs that both china and the u s took the same conclusions out of these talks in the past there were times when one party offered a different conclusion than the other so far that hasn t happened this time but then again there also hasn t been much detail offered financials still not perking up much a recent rise in risk on sentiment with more investors betting against near term volatility and so called defensive sectors like utilities and staples taking another hit on wednesday hasn t permeated the financial sector in any great way yet financials rose slightly wednesday but haven t shown much zip lately this could reflect the treasury yield curve remaining pretty close to flat though it did tick up slightly at mid week perhaps helping the sector a bit the which ended wednesday at 2 71 still has just a 16 basis point premium to the this situation often makes business tough for some banks which tend to make money by lending for the long term and paying for short term deposits if long term rates stay low compared with short term ones banks margins can come under pressure some analysts say a flatter yield curve tends to hurt smaller banks more than larger ones so we ll see late next week what some of the major institutions say when they start putting out q4 earnings news it seems like there s a lot of good stuff going on in the financial industry including what some analysts say are solid credit conditions and strong capital levels that just hasn t been enough it seems to help the sector launch a rally small fry fly back at the end of august the small cap index rut hit an all time high of 1742 then the bottom fell out by christmas eve the index had dropped 27 to just below 1267 putting it well into bear market territory at 13 month lows valuations of small caps fell to a six year trough it s probably too soon to say there s been a turn around but since striking that low the rut is up more than 13 on wednesday its gains once again outpaced the spx what s interesting here for the broader market is that sometimes small caps can be a leading indicator note how the rut s troubles preceded the broader market decline which didn t really get underway until october now the rut is outpacing its big brethren over the last two weeks since the pre holiday plunge earlier this week the wall street journal reported that analysts expect double digit earnings growth for small cap stocks this year by contrast most analysts expect mid single digit earnings growth for companies one caveat to the small stock bull thesis some investors piled into small caps last summer amid trade war worries perhaps thinking that small caps might offer protection because they don t sell so many products into foreign markets however if the tariff battle continues analysts warn that small stocks could still get hit td ameritrade commentary for educational purposes only member sipc options

2018 bloomberg finance lp if the market is bullish right now it is for two reasons and two reasons only china and the fed china is as close to their hard landing scenario as they have ever been the fed is watching now they are pausing with the rate hikes maybe there will be only one rate hike this year cheaper credit is good for stock markets it also protects china that s the bull case the bear case is a host of rotten things spoiling even faster u s and european politics brexit italy france the euro itself china and a hawkish fed hellbent on murdering the job market to borrow from a phrase used by former fed chair ben bernanke during last week s american economic association meeting in atlanta i think the market is worried about four things says naeem aslam chief market strategist for thinkmarkets in london and a forbes contributor he lists the u s government shutdown as one of them though he breaks up china into two concerns its own domestic problems and the external ones caused by trump s trade war 2019 bloomberg finance lp more importantly the fed has become a prisoner of the markets he says they have learned they need to pay attention to market conditions their policy cannot discount this important fact the rout in the equity markets last week made it clear that the fed needs to understand that investors don t like the idea of even one interest rate hike let alone two regarding the government shutdown which may have added to the sluggish start to equities on thursday morning as investors rethink earnings barclays capital economist mike gapen in new york says that for every week the government is shut down another 0 05 percentage points is trimmed off the quarterly u s gdp number the silver lining is that equity valuations have reverted to more historically normal levels the u s is no longer as expensive as it once was the s p 500 started 2018 trading at 23x trailing 12 month earnings after a year of 26 earnings growth and a 6 selloff the s p now stands at 16x trailing earnings anyone who is moderately bullish at the start of the year will like those prices on average the s p 500 experiences 17 trading days a year in which the index moves by 2 or more in either direction there were 20 such days in 2018 roughly in line with the average but zero days in 2017 this year will be more like 2018 only a bit wilder another issue that helps the bear case jobs the job market means more wage growth and wage growth could lead to more inflation though fed chairman jerome powell said last week that he did not yet see any signs that higher wages were leading to a higher cpi more money in more people s pockets should continue to drive economic growth says scott clemons chief investment strategist with brown brothers harriman in new york we see no signs of a recession in 2019 he said adding that a tight labor market could pressure the fed into raising interest rates more rapidly than expected which would be disruptive this will keep the bears happy 2018 bloomberg finance lp the political environment in the u s and europe is contentious threats of impeachment in the u s political crises in the eurozone and china growth slowing more than expected have global ramifications for risk appetite a divided congress in the u s means trump is now like obama and forced to govern largely by executive orders dysfunction in washington is only going to get worse and everyone in the market knows it the u s china trade war while cooling over the last few days remains a hot button issue that seems to be a broader attack on china rather than one focused on trade imbalances and manufacturing jobs says robert doll chief equity strategist and a senior portfolio manager for nuveen judging how these issues might influence economies and financial markets is complicated but they are unlikely to be positive he says in his recent list of 10 predictions for 2019 the confluence of brexit the italian budget the populist turn in eastern europe a weak government in spain the end of the angela merkel era in germany and the end of the mario draghi era at the european central bank means european politics may trump trump in 2019 political upheaval there is a headwind for global markets german stocks are down over 20 in the last 12 months and this should keep the bulls happy the fed is likely on hold for at least the first half of the year the china trade dispute will dissipate as trump and his counterpart xi jinping desperately need a win xi perhaps more than trump as his economy has many more mouths to feed and is deteriorating faster that doesn t mean the trade war is over it just means the two sides have agreed to stop increasing tariffs that s the best case scenario 2019 bloomberg finance lp u s wages

brink he says more so than the pundits expect unsustainable policies inflation trade disputes frothy global equity markets and slower growth among other factors are sure fire indicators that winter is upon us says eswaran sounding a lot like chinese billionaire robin li ceo of search engine baidu who proclaimed last week that winter is coming to the chinese economy gulp maybe the next recession will be short lived not all recessions are great recessions like the one witnessed in 2008 2009 the next recession will create an entirely new direction and even escalate growth in various parts of

the question of the day is can the win streak reach five that might be a struggle judging from how things look early on all of that optimism about the china talks seems to be ebbing a little and there s no timetable for a next round meanwhile in corporate news shares of macy s inc nyse m got crushed ahead of the opening bell after the retailer reported weak holiday results and cut its outlook on the other hand target corporation nyse tgt reported solid holiday sales as we say often the retail sector is really one of individual stories so it s probably best to look at it company by company however as of this morning the entire sector appeared to come under pressure wednesday s moderately higher close for the s p 500 index spx marked the fourth straight day of gains the first time that s happened since a five session stretch ending last sept 14 though stocks closed off their highs they still managed to finish the day just above what might be a key level at 2584 from a technical standpoint the spx s ability to close above that mark could signal underlying strength some analysts believe take pause before calling a pause stocks rose wednesday afternoon after minutes from december s federal open market committee fomc meeting showed fed officials indicating they might have more patience before raising rates further the fed news this week is far from over as fed chair jerome powell speaks today he s been out there a lot lately and frequently moves the market in a big way one direction or another when he talks his remarks today are scheduled for 12 45 p m et and that s not all fed vice chair richard clarida delivers a speech called economic outlook and monetary policy tonight those certainly sound like topics investors might want to hear about from the fed clarida who only recently took the job has been sounding mainly dovish so far some media reports suggested the minutes were a sign of the fed being ready to pause on hikes but that s arguably the wrong word to use as we noted here yesterday the fed is likely going to remain vigilant about inflation last week s jobs report looked like a bases clearing home run and another one like it perhaps accompanied by rising energy prices might have the fed dusting off its previous more hawkish assumptions for 2019 story continues anyone who s lived through a few market cycles likely knows the wheel can spin quickly the fed s biggest fear probably remains inflation mainly because when inflation rises it tends to do so exponentially the fed typically wants to get out ahead of rising prices so don t be surprised if we re back here in a month or two wondering whether a rate hike might be ahead especially if oil goes above 60 a barrel and we have another good jobs report on our hands as a reminder crude rose for the eighth straight session wednesday and is back above 52 a barrel that s a more than 20 rise from the lows seen around christmas weaker dollar possible implications another thing the fed minutes seemed to do besides maybe helping give the stock market a lift was to put more support behind the weak dollar story the dollar index fell to near 95 late on wednesday the lowest level in three months typically rate hikes tend to prop up the currency of the country making them so it would stand to reason that the dollar would weaken if people expect the fed to stay dovish on the other hand a weaker dollar tends to also help lift commodity prices and not just for energy think about food for instance corn wheat cattle and other prices all could start getting support if the dollar stays weak and that also could play into the inflation picture if it lasts a while speaking of which december consumer price index cpi data are due friday analysts expect a drop of 0 1 in the headline number probably in part due to cheap gas prices core cpi which strips out energy and food is seen rising 0 2 according to briefing com getting back to the dollar a weaker greenback might help give multinational u s firms a lift though it s still a bit early to see an earnings impact for q4 more likely any benefits would start to seep into q1 earnings because the dollar stayed pretty strong through most of late 2018 we ll have to wait and see if this is just a pause in the dollar rally or perhaps something more prolonged sentiment shift on earnings it s a new year and maybe that means there s some new sentiment shaping up consider the case of homebuilder lennar corporation nyse len which reported on wednesday that its q4 earnings beat wall street analysts expectations but revenue missed also the company declined to issue guidance citing uncertainty about the market last year when companies had any bad news at all they tended to get punished so when len shares fell right after the earnings it seemed to carry along the 2018 sentiment then later in the day len shares came back in a big way rising more than 9 at one point instead of punishing the stock it looks like at least some investors focused more on some of the positives in the company s earnings report and its call with analysts during the call len said it was seeing improvement in buyer traffic so far in its fiscal q1 as interest rates declined reuters reported this appeared to be one factor in the stock s rally and perhaps it indicates improved investor sentiment as earnings season approaches a similar situation developed right after the market closed wednesday when bed bath beyond nasdaq bbby stock lifted off in post market trading following earnings though it eased back after the macy s news the results were pretty much in line with wall street analysts expectations what seemed to get people excited was the company s fiscal 2019 net earnings guidance which it said would be similar to fiscal 2018 results so does this mean steady as she goes is now considered enough for a stock to rally last year it seemed like steady guidance or even slightly better guidance sent most companies to the woodshed this might be something to ponder in the days ahead in other corporate news early thursday ford nyse f announced job cuts in europe as the company faces struggles in that market the company says its move is designed to improve profitability and reduce costs for investors the announcement could serve as a signal that the auto industry continues to face challenges and it also could be another sign of european economic softness view more earnings on len meanwhile american airlines nasdaq aal shares slid in the pre market after the company cut guidance the aal news comes on the back of recent bad news from delta airlines nyse dal and a major downgrade yesterday on united nasdaq ual clearly the airlines are having a tough time volatility backs off in another sign that sentiment might be changing the market s most closely watched fear index the vix edged below 20 on wednesday for the first time in a month before clawing back above that mark early thursday it had traded well above 30 in the week around christmas as waves of turbulence sent the market up and down like a paper boat in an atlantic hurricane wednesday s vix action put the cash price below the next three months of futures prices see chart below until recently the cash price had been above futures an unusual trend that in the case of vix had appeared to indicate high expectations for more near term volatility as of wednesday afternoon however the near term futures contract prices enjoyed a premium to cash perhaps suggesting that some investors expect relatively calmer times for the moment we ll have to wait and see vix term structure 1 9 19 jpg figure 1 shifting curves hard to believe but it was a little over two weeks ago on christmas eve when a market meltdown pushed near term volatility to its highest levels since february yesterday the first few months of the vix term structure aka vix futures curve moved back to contango meaning nearer term vix futures vx are priced higher than the cash index the red line shows the futures curve on december 24 the yellow line shows it as of yesterday s close when the index settled at 19 98 data source cboe global markets chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade for illustrative purposes only past performance does not guarantee future results nice bun but not a lot of beef on trade this week brought plenty of positive headlines about trade talks but not a lot of specifics while it s always nice to hear that china is buying some u s products as it did recently by scooping up another load of soybeans the issues are far more complex than simple product trade it s unclear if the two countries can make progress on more complicated issues like intellectual property and technology transfers then there s the issue of what sort of compliance might be built into any deal china has made deals in the past but compliance is sometimes troublesome as u s commerce secretary wilbur ross pointed out in a televised interview a few days ago the trade talks ended wednesday in beijing markets appeared to get a shot in the arm as the talks occurred but the optimism started to fade by thursday a lot could hang on whether the two parties schedule another round or retreat to their separate corners for a while also investors might be looking for signs that both china and the u s took the same conclusions out of these talks in the past there were times when one party offered a different conclusion than the other so far that hasn t happened this time but then again there also hasn t been much detail offered financials still not perking up much a recent rise in risk on sentiment with more investors betting against near term volatility and so called defensive sectors like utilities and staples taking another hit on wednesday hasn t permeated the financial sector in any great way yet financials rose slightly wednesday but haven t shown much zip lately this could reflect the treasury yield curve remaining pretty close to flat though it did tick up slightly at mid week perhaps helping the sector a bit the 10 year yield which ended wednesday at 2 71 still has just a 16 basis point premium to the two year this situation often makes business tough for some banks which tend to make money by lending for the long term and paying for short term deposits if long term rates stay low compared with short term ones banks margins can come under pressure some analysts say a flatter yield curve tends to hurt smaller banks more than larger ones so we ll see late next week what some of the major institutions say when they start putting out q4 earnings news it seems like there s a lot of good stuff going on in the financial industry including what some analysts say are solid credit conditions and strong capital levels that just hasn t been enough it seems to help the sector launch a rally small fry fly back at the end of august the small cap russell 2000 index rut hit an all time high of 1742 then the bottom fell out by christmas eve the index had dropped 27 to just below 1267 putting it well into bear market territory at 13 month lows valuations of small caps fell to a six year trough it s probably too soon to say there s been a turn around but since striking that low the rut is up more than 13 on wednesday its gains once again outpaced the spx what s interesting here for the broader market is that sometimes small caps can be a leading indicator note how the rut s troubles preceded the broader market decline which didn t really get underway until october now the rut is outpacing its big brethren over the last two weeks since the pre holiday plunge earlier this week the wall street journal reported that analysts expect double digit earnings growth for small cap stocks this year by contrast most analysts expect mid single digit earnings growth for s p 500 companies one caveat to the small stock bull thesis some investors piled into small caps last summer amid trade war worries perhaps thinking that small caps might offer protection because they don t sell so many products into foreign markets however if the tariff battle continues analysts warn that small stocks could still get hit

wti is expected to average 63 per barrel b in 2019 said the global outlook for h1 2019 by indosuez wealth management the global wealth management division of crédit agricole uae turning now to the uae we have already pointed to the slightly better public debt outlook when compared to the saudi case the implementation of new taxes such as tourism fees custom duties and vat should alleviate the emirates dependency on energy prices notably the imf expects the uae to deliver a primary surplus from 2018 on the report said however in terms of monetary policy there is not much divergence due to the peg of each currency to the usd with the federal reserve fed getting more restrictive and proceeding with several two in our forecast fed funds interest rate hikes next year the central bank of the uae had to adopt a tightening bias this far the bank has raised its repo rate to 2 5 per cent from 1 per cent at the beginning of 2017 in six steps of 25 basis points higher interest rates obviously do not help the real estate market prices of residential properties declined by 18 9 per cent between the november 2014 high and september 2018 in dubai prices fell by 20 8 per cent between october 2014 and september 2017 on top of the direct impact on the sectors of construction and real estate which weighed 13 4 per cent in the uae s gdp in 2017 there is an indirect effect on consumption due to the negative wealth effect at play curiously while consumer confidence as measured by the bayt com index has never been able to recover from its sharp decline from the end of 2012 the propensity to consume index did not reflect a significantly lower appetite for spending similarly the market purchasing manager s index remained firmly in expansion territory that is above the 50 boom bust line at 55 in october 2018 it is close to its long term average of 55 1 however the advent of protectionism did take its toll for example cargo volumes handled at dubai s airport have been threading water increasing by a meagre 1 9 per cent year on year in september 2018 tourism another pillar of dubai s economy did not expand that much and dubai international airport passenger traffic declined by 0 2 per cent between september 2017 and september 2018 extending a downward trend which started back towards the end of 2015 all in all real gdp growth should be positive this year but not outstanding inflation in the uae spiked to 4 8 per cent year on year in january 2018 due primarily to the introduction of a 5 per cent vat rate but has since begun to ease the september figure stood at 3 1 per cent year on year only it looks like the rate of change in consumer prices will moderate further in the coming months and the imf expects uae s inflation rate to average 3 5 per cent this year before easing to below 2 per cent all of this does not seem to be enough to change the debt outlook as assessed by the various rating agencies as a reminder the current moody s rating applied to abu dhabi long term debt is aa2 which means that the bonds are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk the report concluded saudi arabia an impressive reduction in saudi arabia s budget deficit occurred during the first 9 months of 2018 which happened despite a 25 per cent increase in government spending this is linked on one side to the rise of the oil price as the west texas intermediate wti price has averaged 67 per barrel so far in 2018 compared to 51 per barrel in 2017 on the other side non oil income also increased dramatically according to the government this reflects the effectiveness of economic reforms and fiscal measures targeting fiscal sustainability as well as the effective management of public finances the report said the government is targeting a fiscal deficit of 7 3 per cent of gdp this year and a balanced budget by 2023 according to the international monetary fund imf estimates a wti oil price close to 88 per barrel would be required to balance the 2018 budget despite this deficit reduction the debt to gdp ratio is set to rise over the coming years given a 3 3 per cent weighted average coupon for saudi bonds and a 2017 debt to nominal gdp ratio of 17 1 per cent the cost of servicing the debt amounts to 3 875 million 3 3 per cent x 17 1 per cent x 686 738 million per year deducting this amount from the 2018 projected total deficit 52 billion gives us the primary deficit that is roughly 48 billion or 6 7 per cent of gdp with such a deficit even the 17 8 per cent year on year yoy nominal gdp growth recorded in q2 2018 is not high enough to stabilise the debt to gdp ratio the latter could reach 24 2 per cent by 2023 imf fiscal monitor april 2018 we also note that the weight of debt in percent of gdp close to 20 per cent is not very different from that of its regional peer the united arab emirates uae however in contrast the uae s debt to gdp ratio is on a stabilising path that being said saudi arabia s government has been trying to reduce its dependency on oil revenue amongst the various measures to rebalance its budget it introduced a 5 per cent vat on 1 january 2018 it was no surprise that this plan had a negative impact on the business climate in the non oil sector as can be seen in the sharp decrease in the purchasing managers index pmi to an all time low of 51 4 in april 2018 nevertheless the pmi managed to stay above the 50 boom bust line and rebounded to 53 8 in october 2018 chart 10 obtaining the most up to date assessments of growth requires more frequent indicators than quarterly gdp figures alone for example oil prices atm withdrawals etc using these variables we now expect nominal gdp growth to slow down somewhat following the strong q2 figure with regards to inflation it is

new york the us dollar dropped on wednesday hitting a new low since october last year as the latest minutes of us federal reserve s policy meeting hinted at less monetary tightening and investors pinned hope on the just concluded us china trade talks in late new york trading the euro rose to 1 1544 from 1 1442 in the previous session and the british pound rose to 1 2794 from 1 2719 in the previous session xinhua news agency reported the australian dollar was up to 0 7180 from 0 7139 the us dollar bought 108 26 japanese yen lower than 108 63 japanese yen of the previous session the us dollar was down to 0 9750 swiss franc from 0 9812 swiss franc and it fell to 1 3221 canadian dollars from 1 3282 canadian dollars the committee could afford to be patient about further policy firming said the federal open market committee fomc in the minutes of the december 18 19 2018 released on wednesday the statement was made as the fomc a fed branch that determines interest rates and the country s money supply growth believed that the recent volatility in financial markets and the increased concerns about global growth have made the appropriate extent and timing of future policy firming less clear than earlier in consideration of the status quo of the financial markets the committee stressed that a relatively limited amount of additional tightening likely would be appropriate such moves indicate that the us central bank would likely loosen its constraints on the money flowing in the market which would consequently reduce the greenback s comparative edge investor sentiment also grew positive on hopes of good results from the just concluded trade talks between us trade representatives and chinese officials in beijing a stable global trade system would offer a relief for risky yet profitable assets investors and allow them to reduce their holding of safehaven currencies like the greenback the dollar index which measures the greenback against six major peers fell 0 72 per cent at 95 2150 in late trading ians
2019 bloomberg finance lp the question of the day is can the win streak reach five that might be a struggle judging from how things look early on all of that optimism about the china talks seems to be ebbing a little and there s no timetable for a next round meanwhile in corporate news shares of macy s got crushed ahead of the opening bell after the retailer reported weak holiday results and cut its outlook on the other hand target reported solid holiday sales as we say often the retail sector is really one of individual stories so it s probably best to look at it company by company however as of this morning the entire sector appeared to come under pressure wednesday s moderately higher close for the s p 500 index marked the fourth straight day of gains the first time that s happened since a five session stretch ending last sept 14 though stocks closed off their highs they still managed to finish the day just above what might be a key level at 2584 from a technical standpoint the s p 500 s ability to close above that mark could signal underlying strength some analysts believe take pause before calling a pause stocks rose wednesday afternoon after minutes from december s federal open market committee fomc meeting showed fed officials indicating they might have more patience before raising rates further the fed news this week is far from over as fed chair jerome powell speaks today he s been out there a lot lately and frequently moves the market in a big way one direction or another when he talks his remarks today are scheduled for 12 45 p m et and that s not all fed vice chair richard clarida delivers a speech called economic outlook and monetary policy tonight those certainly sound like topics investors might want to hear about from the fed clarida who only recently took the job has been sounding mainly dovish so far some media reports suggested the minutes were a sign of the fed being ready to pause on hikes but that s arguably the wrong word to use as we noted here yesterday the fed is likely going to remain vigilant about inflation last week s jobs report looked like a bases clearing home run and another one like it perhaps accompanied by rising energy prices might have the fed dusting off its previous more hawkish assumptions for 2019 anyone who s lived through a few market cycles likely knows the wheel can spin quickly the fed s biggest fear probably remains inflation mainly because when inflation rises it tends to do so exponentially the fed typically wants to get out ahead of rising prices so don t be surprised if we re back here in a month or two wondering whether a rate hike might be ahead especially if oil goes above 60 a barrel and we have another good jobs report on our hands as a reminder crude rose for the eighth straight session wednesday and is back above 52 a barrel that s a more than 20 rise from the lows seen around christmas weaker dollar possible implications another thing the fed minutes seemed to do besides maybe helping give the stock market a lift was to put more support behind the weak dollar story the dollar index fell to near 95 late on wednesday the lowest level in three months typically rate hikes tend to prop up the currency of the country making them so it would stand to reason that the dollar would weaken if people expect the fed to stay dovish on the other hand a weaker dollar tends to also help lift commodity prices and not just for energy think about food for instance corn wheat cattle and other prices all could start getting support if the dollar stays weak and that also could play into the inflation picture if it lasts a while speaking of which december consumer price index cpi data are due friday analysts expect a drop of 0 1 in the headline number probably in part due to cheap gas prices core cpi which strips out energy and food is seen rising 0 2 according to briefing com getting back to the dollar a weaker greenback might help give multinational u s firms a lift though it s still a bit early to see an earnings impact for q4 more likely any benefits would start to seep into q1 earnings because the dollar stayed pretty strong through most of late 2018 we ll have to wait and see if this is just a pause in the dollar rally or perhaps something more prolonged sentiment shift on earnings it s a new year and maybe that means there s some new sentiment shaping up consider the case of homebuilder lennar which reported on wednesday that its q4 earnings beat wall street analysts expectations but revenue missed also the company declined to issue guidance citing uncertainty about the market last year when companies had any bad news at all they tended to get punished so when lennar shares fell right after the earnings it seemed to carry along the 2018 sentiment then later in the day lennar shares came back in a big way rising more than 9 at one point instead of punishing the stock it looks like at least some investors focused more on some of the positives in the company s earnings report and its call with analysts during the call lennar said it was seeing improvement in buyer traffic so far in its fiscal q1 as interest rates declined reuters reported this appeared to be one factor in the stock s rally and perhaps it indicates improved investor sentiment as earnings season approaches a similar situation developed right after the market closed wednesday when bed bath beyond stock lifted off in post market trading following earnings though it eased back after the macy s news the results were pretty much in line with wall street analysts expectations what seemed to get people excited was the company s fiscal 2019 net earnings guidance which it said would be similar to fiscal 2018 results so does this mean steady as she goes is now considered enough for a stock to rally last year it seemed like steady guidance or even slightly better guidance sent most companies to the woodshed this might be something to ponder in the days ahead in other corporate news early thursday ford announced job cuts in europe as the company faces struggles in that market the company says its move is designed to improve profitability and reduce costs for investors the announcement could serve as a signal that the auto industry continues to face challenges and it also could be another sign of european economic softness meanwhile american airlines shares slid in the pre market after the company cut guidance the american airlines news comes on the back of recent bad news from delta and a major downgrade yesterday on united clearly the airlines are having a tough time volatility backs off in another sign that sentiment might be changing the market s most closely watched fear index the cboe volatility index edged below 20 on wednesday for the first time in a month before clawing back above that mark early thursday it had traded well above 30 in the week around christmas as waves of turbulence sent the market up and down like a paper boat in an atlantic hurricane wednesday s cboe volatility index action put the cash price below the next three months of futures prices see chart below until recently the cash price had been above futures an unusual trend that in the case of vix had appeared to indicate high expectations for more near term volatility as of wednesday afternoon however the near term futures contract prices enjoyed a premium to cash perhaps suggesting that some investors expect relatively calmer times for the moment we ll have to wait and see data source cboe global markets chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade nice bun but not a lot of beef on trade this week brought plenty of positive headlines about trade talks but not a lot of specifics while it s always nice to hear that china is buying some u s products as it did recently by scooping up another load of soybeans the issues are far more complex than simple product trade it s unclear if the two countries can make progress on more complicated issues like intellectual property and technology transfers then there s the issue of what sort of compliance might be built into any deal china has made deals in the past but compliance is sometimes troublesome as u s commerce secretary wilbur ross pointed out in a televised interview a few days ago the trade talks ended wednesday in beijing markets appeared to get a shot in the arm as the talks occurred but the optimism started to fade by thursday a lot could hang on whether the two parties schedule another round or retreat to their separate corners for a while also investors might be looking for signs that both china and the u s took the same conclusions out of these talks in the past there were times when one party offered a different conclusion than the other so far that hasn t happened this time but then again there also hasn t been much detail offered financials still not perking up much a recent rise in risk on sentiment with more investors betting against near term volatility and so called defensive sectors like utilities and staples taking another hit on wednesday hasn t permeated the financial sector in any great way yet financials rose slightly wednesday but haven t shown much zip lately this could reflect the treasury yield curve remaining pretty close to flat though it did tick up slightly at mid week perhaps helping the sector a bit the 10 year yield which ended wednesday at 2 71 still has just a 16 basis point premium to the two year this situation often makes business tough for some banks which tend to make money by lending for the long term and paying for short term deposits if long term rates stay low compared with short term ones banks margins can come under pressure some analysts say a flatter yield curve tends to hurt smaller banks more than larger ones so we ll see late next week what some of the major institutions say when they start putting out q4 earnings news it seems like there s a lot of good stuff going on in the financial industry including what some analysts say are solid credit conditions and strong capital levels that just hasn t been enough it seems to help the sector launch a rally small fry fly back at the end of august the small cap russell 2000 index hit an all time high of 1742 then the bottom fell out by christmas eve the index had dropped 27 to just below 1267 putting it well into bear market territory at 13 month lows valuations of small caps fell to a six year trough it s probably too soon to say there s been a turn around but since striking that low the russell 2000 is up more than 13 on wednesday its gains once again outpaced the s p 500 what s interesting here for the broader market is that sometimes small caps can be a leading indicator note how the russell 2000 s troubles preceded the broader market decline which didn t really get underway until october now the russell 2000 is outpacing its big brethren over the last two weeks since the pre holiday plunge earlier this week the wall street journal reported that analysts expect double digit earnings growth for small cap stocks this year by contrast most analysts expect mid single digit earnings growth for s p 500 companies one caveat to the small stock bull thesis some investors piled into small caps last summer amid trade war worries perhaps thinking that small caps might offer protection because they don t sell so many products into foreign markets however if the tariff battle continues analysts warn that small stocks could still get hit td ameritrade commentary for

the u s government shutdown is about to become the longest on record and the media comment is increasingly focusing on the personal and the economic costs of the shutdown financial markets have paused in their more optimistic assessment of life as a result although it is probably still too soon to say bye bye to equities the abrupt end to the white house congressional discussions yesterday has seemingly reduced investor expectations for a more rapid conclusion to the current problem the longer the government shutdown lasts the greater personal and economic costs and with that the greater the impact on financial markets to some extent this is not about the current shutdown but about investors anticipating how things will play out with a gridlocked washington over the next couple of years at some point in the second quarter there is the debt ceiling debate and then in september of this year there is another budget debate the signal of problems with the current situation has implications beyond the immediate future if there is a move to resolution then the economic damage now will be limited and there may possibly be more optimism about future collaboration and financial markets can then return to being more positive otherwise the world of policy was marginally more favorable to financial markets the china u s trade talks concluded in a reasonably positive way there is unlikely to be a major major trade deal any time soon but the sense is that the worst of the risks are being managed fomc minutes and then the federal reserve minutes of the fomc meeting of december 18 19 seem to be more dovish than the december language of the fed had suggested it is noted that the fed is now at the bottom end of the range for neutral interest rates and the suggestion of a pause to reflect that came through more clearly if the fed sees the core pce inflation measure that follows 2 percent or so with 2 percent economic growth and if the market expects a rate hike which is more likely than not then the fed on the basis of these minutes will probably raise rates again those conditions should be met this year but in the absence of economic data as a result of the government shutdown at the moment it may take a while for the conditions to be met european central bank minutes the european central bank ecb offered also today the minutes of their monetary policy meeting of october 24 25 and here there is less room for excitement the ecb is barely starting its process of policy adjustment even as the federal reserve is moving into the later stages of policy adjustment of course as the euro area lagged behind the united states in terms of the economic recovery this is not perhaps so surprising policy perceptions are somewhat frozen until ecb president draghi is escorted off the premises later in september this year and a new leadership is installed bringing in a new assessment to the eurozone s economic outlook china inflation chinese inflation data came in overnight with consumer prices moderating somewhat chinese consumer prices are mainly about food which china doesn t export so it s of limited importance to the rest of the world the things that the american and european exporters sell to china are not generally given much weight in chinese inflation numbers either producer prices are slightly more relevant to the rest of the world but like producer prices everywhere else they have been affected by low oil prices at the end of last year china did announce some further tax cuts for small and medium sized businesses yesterday following the recent pattern the process is of a bit of stimulus here and a bit of stimulus there emphasizing the political significance of meeting growth expectations overall the south china morning post reported etienne hans parisis is a bank economist who has advised investors on financial markets and international investments

stalemated over trump s insistence on money for a border wall rather the federal reserve looks likely to hold off on further interest rate hikes as trump has been insisting since he started inveighing

go slow approach two of the regional fed bank presidents who on wednesday indicated a new willingness to wait eric rosengren of boston and charles evans of chicago have been relatively hawkish but given recent uncertainty including the stock market s choppiness current monetary policy seems appropriate for now rosengren said the comments came as minutes from the fed s december meeting revealing central bank policymakers are feeling increasingly cautious about how to proceed at that meeting bankers closed out the year by approving their fourth rate hike of 2018 just a few months prior they had penciled in another four hikes for this year goldman sachs continued projecting four hikes in 2019 until last month but with global growth stumbling trade tensions rising and stocks gyrating many

to financial markets during a question and answer session in atlanta with the muted inflation readings that we ve seen coming in we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves powell said taken together the commentary supports the conclusion now firmly embedded in markets that the next rate hike will come no sooner than june if it comes at all pantheon macroeconomics s chief economist ian shepherdson wrote in a wednesday note but he also pointed to what he argued is some faulty logic in the stock market if i have this straight stocks are rallying because investors think the trade war which pushed stocks down will soon be over but they still think that the fed can t hike again even though the fed only stepped back its rate forecasts because the trade war trashed stocks huh ian shepherdson ianshepherdson january 9 2019 in his note shepherdson predicted that if the united states and china strike a trade deal stocks will rally sharply smoothing the path for the fed to resume hiking fed officials we think will come to regret their knee jerk reactions to the drop in stocks in the fourth quarter because the bigger picture hasn t changed much he writes in short if you believe that the u s and china will soon reach a trade agreement then the risk of further fed rates hikes later this year is much greater than is currently implied by markets advertisement

asia pacific is the world s largest aviation market and overall has performed strongly again this year but there are pockets of weakness in some markets that look set to roll on into 2019 during a recent interview with flightglobal boc aviation chief executive robert martin noted that while the airline industry continues to be strong this is being driven by the fortunes of the american and largest european carriers you have some other carriers who are in the weaker developing markets who may have a foreign exchange issue he adds they are getting hit by a strong dollar and obviously fuel is in us dollars rising us dollar interest rates on their aircraft financing rising domestic interest rates on their working capital financing and they may have been hit with some delays over the summer for instance carriers in india and indonesia have been feeling the impact of the stronger dollar against their local currencies which has exacerbated costs and started draining cash china as the powerhouse of the asia pacific market continues to grow strongly but a major cloud over the trade relations with the usa a market in which chinese carriers have grown strongly in over the past few years remains indian carriers reel as capacity and costs grow india may be one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world but the last year saw carriers struggle to pass on higher costs to passengers resulting in more strain on their balance sheets stronger fuel prices in 2018 were felt particularly hard in the indian market with the double whammy of a depreciating home currency which further increased fuel and other us dollar denominated costs speaking during the airline s earnings call in october market leader indigo s chief financial officer rohit philip cited those higher costs for a fall to a pre tax loss of rs10 billion for the quarter ended september unfortunately these higher input costs have not been recovered as fares remain low due to continued intense competition he also pointed to a change in passenger behaviour over the year which has seen fares closer to the departure date fall the 0 15 day booking window remains weak with lower fares compared to the same period last year this has been further accentuated by the significant increase in capacity in the market flightglobal schedules data shows that capacity has grown by 18 between 2017 and 2018 forward filed schedules for the year to november 2019 indicate that there will be at least 10 more asms added to the market over the next 12 months those market conditions led local credit ratings agency icra to downgrade its ratings on indigo although it has acknowledged that the budget carrier is best placed among india s airlines to weather the storm thanks to its strong liquidity and focus on cost controls while backing its position indigo has signalled that it is reversing earlier plans to take more aircraft onto its balance sheet and will extend its sale and leaseback programme on its airbus a320neos in order to preserve its cash the situation is much more challenging at jet airways which has been forced to delay salary payments seek advances on sale and leaseback payments and go on the hunt for new equity in august it confirmed that it had received 300 million in advance payments from lessors likely related to sale and leasebacks on its boeing 737 max 8s at the same time the carrier also confirmed that it was in arrears to lessors on some of its other aircraft lease payments jet has also pointed to further potential to unlock capital from sale and leasebacks on its 777 300ers operating cost improvements from its new narrowbody jets and plans to wet lease atr 72s to indian regional carrier truejet however the wet lease deal looked to have collapsed at the end of 2018 adding to the carrier s pain it confirmed on 31 december that it had defaulted on payments to a consortium of local banks attributing the repayment delays to a cash flow mismatch this prompted credit agency icra to downgrade the carrier s long term loans and non convertible debentures ratings from c to d jet is not alone in relying on sale and leaseback payments to finance operations ratings agency crisil revealed in october that spicejet s cash was under pressure as deliveries of its own 737 max 8s had delayed some payments and it too had sought relief from lessors on overdue rentals on some aircraft despite the challenges facing india s airlines and the continuing growth in capacity there is optimism that the depressed yield environment will turn around in early 2019 the economy is healthy in india and we continue to see demand growing in the 20 range so things may be out of balance a little bit in the short term but with that pace of demand growth we are comfortable that it is going to get back in balance really soon says indigo senior advisor greg taylor what is less certain is the fate of air india following its unsuccessful privatisation attempt in 2018 which failed to yield a single bid for the 76 of the airline on offer it has been reportedly seeking new capital infusions from the government and capital lines from banks as it seeks to reverse years of losses and a major debt load consolidation in indonesia after rupiah rout the crash of a lion air boeing 737 max 8 in late october rounded out a challenging 2018 for indonesian carriers largely driven by a 10 fall in the value of the rupiah over the past year and continuing yield pressures xe com currency data shows that the rupiah traded around idr13 500 to the dollar in january however in october that blew out to idr15 500 commentators have largely blamed the decline of the rupiah on foreign investors selling indonesian assets spurred by rising us interest rates and fears that emerging market risk from turkey and argentina could spread to other emerging economies towards the end of the year the rupiah strengthened to around 14 500 perhaps signalling that the contagion threat is over blown nonetheless the currency is still well off the average trading range over the past few years for most indonesian carriers which sell most of their tickets revenue in rupiah the declines in that currency have caused fuel leasing and maintenance costs typically paid in dollars to shoot up at the same time yields have continued softening creating a massive headache for airlines sriwijaya air s director of corporate planning and business development jefferson jauwena explained in february that air fares on some routes in the country are now cheaper than bus fares and floor prices were not being effectively regulated while there is a price floor this is not being monitored or controlled by the government the price war is just getting crazier every day he added over the year however there was little sign of jakarta stepping in to enforce the price floor more strictly with most carriers still noting yield pressures garuda indonesia chief executive ari askhara told flightglobal in december that there was a need to fix the ecosystem in the domestic market for the benefit of all carriers consolidation appears to be a major part of the answer with garuda announcing a tie up with privately owned carrier sriwijaya air under which its budget unit citilink will take over operational control of sriwijaya and its nam air regional unit garuda is not planning to take a stake in sriwijaya but will appoint five of its seven board directors and three of its seven commissioners says askhara who will himself serve as chairman he adds that the deal will give garuda a 51 share of the domestic market which for many years prior had been dominated by low cost rival lion air maybank investment bank analyst mohshin aziz welcomed the deal telling flightglobal that it would bring some much needed sanity to the market indonesia has always needed consolidation there are just too many airlines there for sriwijaya to be consolidated with another airline makes perfect sense to be bigger is better despite holding a dominant position in the domestic market lion air group also appears to be suffering due to the same conditions plaguing its rivals while the carrier does not disclose numbers its strong use of sale and leasebacks and some sales of on order jets to lessors for placement with other airlines demonstrates that it too has had to pull levers to ensure it has the cash to finance its day to day operations moreover the crash of flight jt610 shortly after take off from jakarta s soekarno hatta international airport on 26 october is also likely to put the carrier under renewed pressure while there have been concerns about the role that certain systems on the boeing 737 max 8 played in the crash the initial report from indonesia s national transportation safety committee highlighted safety deficiencies in its operations boeing also took the unusual step of commenting on the report which some have interpreted as an attack on the carrier lion air group founder rusdi kirana has responded by threatening to cancel hundreds of 737 maxes it still has on order still some believe that it is a tactic aimed at slowing its planned deliveries to deal with the challenges in the indonesian market china strong but trade wars a risk worth watching china remains the world s strongest aviation market but there are concerns that a slowing economy caused by a potential trade war with the usa could have some impact on passenger demand to date the impact of the simmering trade tensions has done little to unnerve the aviation industry any impact was expected to be felt first by air freight operators but the tariffs that the us has put on chinese goods to date have mostly been on commodities and other goods that are rarely shipped by air the risk that tariffs may pave the way for other restrictions such as withdrawing the mutual 10 year visas available between the two countries could have a much greater impact on passenger traffic flightglobal schedules data shows that between 2013 and 2018 capacity on us china routes grew an average of 16 most of which was added by chinese carriers in some cases underwritten by subsidies by provincial and municipal governments in china more immediately a number of chinese carriers have significantly boosted their short term debt this year most of that has been in ultra short and medium term bond issuances in the domestic market where state backed carriers have been able to achieve coupon rates in the 3 4 per annum range while hainan airlines has accepted coupons in the 6 7 range the hna group carrier has been beset by its own challenges brought on by swelling liabilities at its parent company during the past year which has seen its bond rates rise in one case its latest 100 million overseas bond offering attracted an eye watering 12 coupon rate while still profitable for the year to september hainan appeared to be positioning to sell stakes in some of its domestic units with a deal struck to reduce its stake in urumqi air to 30 by selling a block to a unit of the provincial government that has been offset partially by new equity issues by china southern china eastern and air china over the past year all three received capital injections from their parent holding companies and other state owned enterprises in the case of china southern and china eastern privately owned rivals spring airlines and juneyao airlines respectively took minor stakes in those carriers reflecting a policy move by beijing aimed at attracting more private capital into state owned enterpises but larger reforms are occurring in the passenger market in october the first stages of liberalising the long held policy of limiting most routes to one chinese operator started which could spur a new stage of competition among the big three carriers a litmus test of that competition will come in late 2019 when beijing daxing airport opens with china eastern and china southern both planning to use the new airport as a major hub providing an alternative to air china s dominance of beijing capital international airport source cirium dashboard

increase of 4 from the first quarter last fiscal year net income for the first quarter was 13 3 million compared to 12 6 million in the first quarter of last fiscal year an increase of 5 year over year diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were 0 95 compared to 0 90 for the same period last year now let s start with a discussion about our strategic initiatives and the brands that support many of them our long term revenue growth targets are aspirational but we continue to believe that with enough sweat determination and hard work they are achievable we aspire to drive consolidated net sales to approximately 700 million in revenue by the end of fiscal 2025 and in doing so we will follow our 55 30 25 business model we refer to the brands that are going to get us there as our 2025 brands they are wd 40 multi use product wd 40 specialist 3 in one wd 40 bike gt85 1001 spot shot solvol lava and novick our 2025 brands are our core strategic focus for the primary growth engine for the company advertisement advertisement strategic initiative no 1 is to grow wd 40 multi use product our goal under this initiative is to make the blue and yellow can with the little red top available to more people in more places who will find more uses more often in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 sales of wd 40 multi use product was 78 3 million up 5 compared to the first quarter of last year this reflects excellent progress toward our most important strategic initiative to grow wd 40 multi use product to approximately 530 million in revenue by the end of fiscal year 2025 strategic initiative no 2 is to grow the wd 40 specialist product line in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 sales of wd 40 specialist were 8 4 million up 13 compared to the first quarter of last year this continues to move the company toward its goal for this initiative growing the product line to approximately 100 million in revenue by the end of fiscal 2025 we are optimistic about the long term opportunities for wd 40 specialist however there may be some volatility in sales levels along the way due to the timing of promotional programs the building of distribution and various other factors that come with building out a new product line our tribe has delivered some best in class wd 40 specialist products over the last several years as a result we now have an exceptional portfolio of products that we are proud to have way of the wd 40 shield it s now time to maximize the pipeline of products we have developed by enhancing their distribution through focused and deliberate geographic expansion strategic initiative no 3 is to broaden product and revenue base advertisement advertisement strategic initiative no 3 includes maintenance products like 3 in one wd 40 bike and gt85 but it also includes brands such as spot shot lava in the americas 1001 in emea and novick and solvol in australia pacific we believe we are on track to reach a combined revenue of approximately 70 million by 2025 these sales under this strategic initiative were 12 million in the first quarter up 1 compared to last year we spent the last several years better understanding how each of these brands perform in their own unique channels and geographies and many of them generate sizable revenues and they all generate meaningful profit contribution cash flows strategic initiative no 4 is to attract develop and retain outstanding tribe members our goal under this initiative is to attract develop and retain talented tribe members and to grow tribe member engagement to greater than 95 in the last 12 months we ve increased our focus on digital and physical brand building activities with a heightened focus on digital and e commerce and in support of that effort we have hired half a dozen new tribe members with expertise in e commerce digital marketing and digital channel strategy our efforts under this initiative were recently acknowledged in the wall street journal article written by sue shellenbarger in the article she writes about how today s employees seek a place of belonging and the companies which excel and engage in their employees posted profit gains through the last recession of 26 compared with a 14 decline at comparable employees at wd 40 company i am certain that our financial successes lean directly to our outstanding tribe members and their exceptional motivation and dedication nurturing and growing that engagement will continue to be a top priority for us in fiscal year and the years to come strategic initiative no 5 is operational excellence advertisement advertisement at wd 40 company our cornerstone to operational excellence ties closely to one of our core values at wd 40 company which is to make it better than it is today while this is our guiding mantra we continuously focus on optimizing resources systems and processes while applying a rigorous commitment to quality assurance regulatory compliance and intellectual property protection using our 55 30 25 business model as a framework we measure ourselves against this operational excellence initiative i m really excited to share with you that this month we ll be opening our brand new technology center in prime new jersey our technology center will house our new jersey based tribe members and will provide them with a work environment that to conduct laboratory tested base tested research and development in house not only does this new facility provide our r d staff with a modern and functional work environment it also provides us with the opportunity to bring that work in house as much of the scientific and testing work that was performed in the past was now going to be performed in our new laboratory which had historically been outsourced our new tech center is a shining example of our continued focus on making it better than it is today that completes the update on our strategic initiatives so let s move on to the details of our first quarter starting with sales as i mentioned earlier consolidated net sales were 101 3 million in the first quarter up 3 7 million or 4 versus the first quarter of last year translation of foreign subsidiary results from their functional currencies to the u s dollar had an unfavorable impact on sales in the first quarter on a constant currency basis net sales would have been 102 4 million in the first quarter up 4 8 million or 5 compared to last year before i discuss what s happening in each of the individual segments i d like to take a moment to remind investors that though we do not consider our business to be a seasonal one it s common for our sales results to fluctuate one period to another due to various factors including the level of promotional activities specific programs being run at customer locations the timing of customer orders or the impact of new product launches this is all a normal part of our business and we are accustomed to these types of fluctuations and manage them as part of their normal business activities it is when something a little out of the ordinary happens that we discuss it in much greater detail here with our investors advertisement advertisement so let s start with the americas net sales in the americas which includes the united states latin america and canada increased to 47 8 million in the first quarter up about 4 from last year sales of maintenance products increased 7 or 2 7 million in the americas primarily due to higher sales of wd 40 multi use product and wd 40 specialist in the united states maintenance product sales in the united states increased 9 or 2 8 million in the first quarter primarily due to strong sales of wd 40 ez reach the timing of promotional programs as well as an expanded distribution in the online industrial and farm channels in the u s wd 40 specialist sales were up 32 in the first quarter primarily due to a successful holiday gift pack promotion we ran in the country partially offsetting these increases were declines in sales of maintenance products in both canada and in latin america in both canada and latin america maintenance product sales were down 2 during the quarter primarily due to the timing of customer orders as a reminder our maintenance products exclude our home care and cleaning products sales of our home care and cleaning product in the americas decreased 17 in the first quarter compared to the prior year largely due to lower sales of 2 000 flushes and carpet fresh in the u s which declined 35 and 46 respectively we continue to consider our home care and cleaning products except for those listed as 2025 brands as half those brands that continue to generate meaningful contributions and cash flows but are generally expected to become a smaller part of the business over time in total our americas segment made up 47 of our global sales over the long term we anticipate sales within this segment will grow between 2 to 5 annually now on to emea net sales in emea which includes europe the middle east africa and india increased to 38 7 million in the first quarter up 11 from last year emea s reported results in the first quarter were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates advertisement advertisement on a constant currency basis sales in emea would have increased to 39 3 million in the first quarter up 12 from last year transaction related impacts in emea were insignificant in this quarter we sell into emea through a combination of direct operations as well as through marketing distributors net sales in our emea direct markets which accounted for 64 of the region s sales increased 10 during the first quarter to 24 8 million this growth was a result of increased sales of wd 40 multi use product throughout most of the emea direct markets due to a higher level of promotional activities increased distribution and the timing of customer orders net sales in emea were also positively impacted in the quarter by a 40 increase in sales in home care and cleaning products during the quarter which was due to a successful digital promotion we ran in the united kingdom for our 1001 carpet fresh product net sales in emea distributor markets which accounted for 36 of the region s sales increased 11 during the quarter to 14 million this increase was primarily due to increased sales of wd 40 multi use product in eastern europe because of the improved economic conditions in the region as well as the timing of customer orders also contributing to the increase in sales were higher sales of multi use product in india due to the higher level of distribution supported by our increased investment in branding activities the emea segment made up 38 of our global business over the long term we expect the segment will grow our sales between 8 and 10 annually now down to asia pacific consolidated net sales in asia pacific which includes australia china and countries in other countries in the asian region decreased to 14 7 million in the first quarter down 10 from last year changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales in the region on a constant currency basis sales in asia pacific would have decreased to 15 2 million in the first quarter down 7 from last year in australia net sales were 3 9 million in the first quarter down 13 compared to last year advertisement advertisement changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on sales in the region of australia on a constant currency basis sales in australia decreased 6 compared to last year the decrease in sales during the first quarter was due primarily to the timing of customer orders and decreased promotional activities in our asia distributor market net sales were 7 8 million in the first quarter down 13 compared to the last year primarily due to the timing of customer orders we had a very strong fourth quarter and the first quarter is a reflection of a bit of a hangover from that activity our asian distributor markets are not impacted by currency since we sell our product in the u s in u s dollars in the region in china net sales in the u s dollars were 3 million in the first quarter up 4 compared to last year on a constant currency basis sales in china increased 9 compared to last year due to successful promotional programs that were conducted in the first quarter of this year we remain optimistic about the long term opportunities in china although expect a lot of volatility going away due to the timing of promotional programs the building of distribution shifting economic condition economic patterns and varying industrial activities the asia pacific segment made up 15 of our global business over the long term we expect sales within the segment will grow between 10 and 12 annually that s it for me for now i ll turn it over to jay who will continue with a review of the financials jay rembolt vice president and chief financial officer thanks garry first let s start with a review of our 55 30 25 business model the long term targets we use to guide our business as you may recall the 55 represents gross margin which we target to be at 55 of net sales the 30 represents our cost of doing business which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization our goal is to drive our cost of doing business over time toward 30 of net sales and then finally the 25 represents our target for ebitda well first the 55 or our gross margin in the first quarter our gross margin was 55 1 compared to 55 5 last year this represented a decline of 40 basis points changes in major input costs which include petroleum based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans were there primary driver of this decline and negatively impacted our gross margin by 200 basis points as a reminder there s often about a 90 to 120 day lag or more before changes in raw material costs impact our cost of goods sold due to production and inventory life cycles the average cost of raw materials that flowed through our cost of goods in the first quarter was higher this year compared to the first quarter last year which put pressure on gross margin in all three trading blocks petroleum based specialty chemical costs negatively impacted our gross margin by 160 basis points period over period also contributing negatively to the gross margin of 40 basis points was the increased cost of aerosol cans these negative impacts to gross margin were partially offset by the favorable effects of price increases which we ve implemented in all three trading blocks over the last 12 months and which positively impacted gross margin by 120 basis points in the first quarter sales and exchanges and other miscellaneous costs also positively impacted our gross margin by 40 basis points this is driven by lower inbound freight costs and favorable sales and exchanges as we continue to increase sales of premium products like wd 40 smart straw ez reach and wd 40 specialist as a reminder our long term gross margin target of 55 is not contingent upon commodity prices staying at any particular price point we cannot control the global market dynamics but we can continue to be focused and deliver in managing the rest of our business so that we can maintain gross margin at or above our target of 55 over the long term now look at the 30 or our cost of doing business in the first quarter our cost of doing business was approximately 37 compared to 36 last year the first quarter sg a increased 1 5 million and our advertising and promotional investment increased 900 000 which negatively impacted our cost of doing business percentage our sg a increased 5 compared to last year primarily due to higher employee related costs increased expenses associated with travel meetings and professional services as we ve shared with investors we ve increased our investments in advertising and promotion to support both physical and digital brand building initiatives in support of those initiatives our a p investment increased 17 year over year as a percentage of sales our a p investment was 5 9 in the first quarter compared to 5 2 last year for the first quarter 75 of our cost of doing business came from three areas people costs or the investments we make in our tribe the investments we make in marketing advertising and promotion and finally freight costs to get our products to our customers while our long term objective is to have our cost of doing business closer to our target of 30 of net sales we will continue to make necessary investments in support of our brand building activities and our fifth strategic initiative operational excellence ultimately revenue growth is the most important factor in helping us achieve our long term target of 30 this will bring us now to ebitda the last of our 55 30 25 measures ebitda was 18 of net sales in the first quarter of this year compared to 20 last year well that completes the discussion of our 55 30 25 business model for the current quarter now i ll look at some other items below ebitda the provision for income tax was 17 6 in the first quarter compared to 23 7 last year the decrease in the effective income tax rate was due to the favorable impact from the tax cuts and jobs act in the u s which became effective for us in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 we expect that our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2019 will be in the 21 to 22 range net income for the first quarter was 13 3 million versus 12 6 million in the prior year reflecting an increase of 5 this resulted in diluted earnings per common share of 0 95 in the first quarter compared to 0 90 in the same period last year and diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased to 13 9 million shares from 14 million shares a year ago now a word about capital allocation our capital allocation strategy includes a comprehensive approach to balance investing in long term growth while providing strong terms to stockholders our maintenance capex is usually between 1 and 2 of net sales but we are planning to make additional investments in fiscal 2019 in total we expect to invest about 22 million in capex this fiscal year in support of our fifth strategic initiativs operational excellence this includes regular maintenance capex and costs associated with completing the development of our new facilities in the united kingdom and new jersey additionally this investment will support an innovation that will enhance our end user experience lower our manufacturing costs and ultimately improve our gross margin we look forward to updating investors on this exciting innovation in the near future we understand the importance of regular dividends to our stockholders we target a dividend payout ratio of about 50 of net income on december 11 2018 our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0 61 per share reflecting an increase of 13 over the previous quarter s dividend of 0 54 a share this increase represents the ninth consecutive year the company has raised its dividend over which time the dividend has increased 144 based on today s closing price of 183 78 the annualized dividend yield is 1 3 during the first quarter we repurchased just over 41 000 shares of our stock at a total cost of 6 9 million under our current 75 million share repurchase plan which was approved by the board in june 2018 at the end of our first fiscal quarter we had 68 1 million remaining under the plan so with that let s turn to fiscal 2019 guidance our guidance remains unchanged from what we issued in october 2018 uncertainty around foreign exchange rates particularly the british pound and commodity prices are making it unusually challenging to forecast certain elements of our business if foreign exchange rates remain close to current levels for the remainder of fiscal 2019 we would expect net sales to be in the lower end of our guidance range in addition we have not updated our guidance to reflect today s lower crude oil prices because we have not yet determined if crude oil at less than 65 a barrel is an event or a trend additionally it s important to clarify that even though petroleum based specialty chemicals make up a significant portion approximately 35 of the input costs associated with the can of the wd 40 multi use product only a small portion of that is directly tied to the cost of crude oil this is because we do not buy crude oil we buy custom formulated specialty chemicals which have complex cost drivers including manufacturing region fixed product costs and distinctive supply and demand characteristics so though the current price of crude could be a net positive in our gross margin in future periods it s too early to determine when and by how much therefore our guidance remains unchanged sales growth is projected in our guidance sales growth is projected to be between 4 and 7 with net sales expected to be between 425 million and 437 million gross margin for the full year is expected to be near the 55 advertising and promotion investment is expected to be between 5 5 and 6 of net sales the provision for income tax is expected to be between 21 and 22 and net income projected to be between 62 2 million and 63 2 million diluted earnings per share is expected to be between 4 51 and 4 58 based on an estimated 13 8 million weighted average shares outstanding and note that this guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures and that completes the financial review now i ll turn it back to garry garry ridge president and chief executive officer hey thanks jay so let s sum up on what you heard from us on the call today you heard that we had a 4 global sales growth in the first quarter you heard that

guidance however we acknowledge that there are some global dynamics which are entirely out of our control and may positively or negatively impact that guidance so in closing i d like to share with you a quote from colin powell a dream doesn t become reality through magic it takes sweat determination and hard work thank you for joining us today we d be pleased to now open the conference to your calls for questions wendy kelley director of investor relations and corporate communications operator questions and answers operator one moment for our first question our first question comes from the line of linda bolton weiser from d a davidson please proceed with your question linda bolton weiser d a davidson analyst hi happy new year garry ridge president and chief executive officer happy new year jay rembolt vice president and chief financial officer hi linda linda bolton weiser d a davidson analyst hi so i guess first of all can you first review because i m just getting back on board here so i don t have a recent memory of when was the rough time period when you first started to take price increases and then when was the most recent price increase taken garry ridge president and chief executive officer so in the united states our most recent price increase went into effect around the june and july period of last year with the total impact of that increase probably not realizing until well into the fourth quarter and then in other geographic locations particularly emea and asia pacific they were staged during the year depending on the country and then prior to that in the united states the last price rise we took i think was six years ago linda bolton weiser d a davidson analyst oh ok ok so then i mean the way things work here i mean they re fairly recent than you said these price increases so you would expect to hang on to them for a while even as we see this oil price roll over here we would expect the pricing to hold up a little bit longer i would think is that correct garry ridge president and chief executive officer we re not planning on making any changes to our pricing at this time linda bolton weiser d a davidson analyst ok and what was the rough magnitude of the pricing in the u s that you took garry ridge president and chief executive officer it was about 4 linda bolton weiser d a davidson analyst ok and then so you did really well in the quarter on the sales line the u s and emea looked really good and even though the comparison in the prior year period was quite difficult actually so can you just gave us a little more color on that and just as a general strength in the business anything in particular and then the comparisons actually getting easier in the second fiscal quarter so should we be expecting even stronger growth garry ridge president and chief executive officer we expect that growth for the year will be in line with our guidance overall as you know we don t really forecast quarter to quarter but in the first quarter as i shared in the u s it was a very nice quarter we saw growth in our core product wd 40 multi use product driven particularly around one of our new initiatives which is ez reach and also some growth in our specialist product around a special holiday pack that we trialed in the u s that we feel was reasonably successful in emea it was really across the board both made up of new distribution and the continual conversion of our classic can to our smart straw can in europe and as you might remember linda when we converted from classic to smart straw we get a revenue lift because of pricing and then of course there was a rebound in europe around our md markets in russia and eastern europe and we re starting also now to see some really nice sustainable growth out of india we ve been investing in india and we re starting to see some traction there and then overall linda as you might know we ve deliberately taken an investment opportunity in both digital and e commerce and we ve been seeing some good growth in our digital areas in asia pac where we didn t grow that well it was primarily our distributor markets and it was really a hangover from last quarter we had a very very strong q4 which was due to the distributors getting back on track after we ve made some changes there so we should see things in asia pacific start to normalize over the next three quarters and we anticipate we ll have revenue growth in asia pac in line with our expectations for the full year linda bolton weiser d a davidson analyst ok and then can you just i mean there s been a lot of investor anxiety i guess over the potential for a recession in the u s at least can you just remind me how your business behaves in a recession is it actually a little bit countercyclical or can you just give a little bit color about the nature of your business in that kind of environment garry ridge president and chief executive officer we re not recession proof but we have been called recession resistant and past history we ve been around for 30 years in the business we ve come through we continued to invest in our business through the recessions whether and the other thing that plays even more in our favor now is our geographic diversity in 2008 when we had the financial crisis our business was actually sideways we actually grew a little and if it wasn t for the collapse if you will of the pound u s dollar exchange rate we would have grown but the impact was more in the u s not in europe so let s hope that we don t talk ourselves into a recession and let s hope that we continue to make large hotdogs and put them on good buns and don t actually find ourselves in that position but we feel that our spread across geography and our spread across trade channels gives us the best chance we can possibly have through different economic conditions and different countries at different times around the world linda bolton weiser d a davidson analyst great and then just finally i know you ve kind of alluded to another new product innovation that you re working on are you still garry ridge president and chief executive officer yes linda bolton weiser d a davidson analyst are you still thinking that you might be able to talk about it in march and then when would the potential launch be garry ridge president and chief executive officer we will review all and reveal all in march so please be with us then because we re really excited linda bolton weiser d a davidson analyst and when do you think the launch would be of the product garry ridge president and chief executive officer we ll talk about that in march linda bolton weiser d a davidson analyst ok ok that s all for me thanks very much garry ridge president and chief executive officer thanks linda operator your next question comes from the line of daniel rizzo from jefferies please proceed with your question daniel rizzo jefferies analyst good afternoon everyone how are you garry ridge president and chief executive officer hi daniel daniel rizzo jefferies analyst hey you mentioned that in 2008 your business was sideways or just intact i guess are you saying that volumes held in and that it was just really fx i mean how did i guess how did pricing volumes act during such an environment were they down a little bit were they flat or just any color garry ridge president and chief executive officer 2008 it was really the major sideways is because of exchange rates and it was the exchange of the british pound to the u s dollar volumes were reasonably as far as i can remember now you re asking me to remember details 11 years ago that s pretty hard for me but i do know that the majority of the impact was exchange remember that jay jay rembolt vice president and chief financial officer yes the sterling collapsed by about 25 there was a very deep decline from the prior year to the from 2007 to 2008 and so a big big chunk of it came from the currency we saw growth in most of the european markets u s was a little bit u s was a little sideways if i remember specifically this a couple of channels had maybe a little bit more disruption than most but net net i think volumes across the board were about showed a little growth yes that s what i recall daniel rizzo jefferies analyst ok and then you guys talked about your digitization effort which seem to be going fairly well and i don t know if that s in the past but are you working with amazon i mean is that a distribution channel of yours or are you getting your own garry ridge president and chief executive officer yes daniel rizzo jefferies analyst it is garry ridge president and chief executive officer yes yes we re very engaged with amazon amazon is a direct customer of ours and i think they re in our top i don t know they re in the top 20 customer list with specialists particularly daniel rizzo jefferies analyst ok and then finally for free cash flow is there a seasonality threat just in terms of payments versus give and takes with working capital garry ridge president and chief executive officer there i m sure there s a few little tweaks but for the most part it isn t i mean there are times when you ve got some tax payments our growth reward program payments that in the grand scheme of things is very minor daniel rizzo jefferies analyst ok all right thank you very much garry ridge president and chief executive officer thanks daniel operator your next question comes from the line of rosemarie morbelli from g research please go ahead with your question rosemarie morbelli g research analyst thank you and good afternoon everyone garry ridge president and chief executive officer good afternoon rosemarie morbelli g research analyst i was wondering if you are seeing any impact from the trade war in china and if not is it because you are too small and it is not affecting you or any other reason garry ridge president and chief executive officer we are not really seeing any impact at all at this time we don t import much from china so the tariff side isn t working with us and it s kind of jay jay rembolt vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean there are some indirect impacts but it s hard to measure and it s hard to really stand down you ve got some hesitancy in a market to do something that a period of time but it doesn t feel like it s sustained rosemarie morbelli g research analyst ok and no impact i mean then i think that indonesia for example has put some tariff on chinese goods is that affecting you are you not in indonesia garry ridge president and chief executive officer no we have a very large business in indonesia but we ve seen no impact with any tariff i m not sure that it s impacting our product but in fact i don t think it is because we would have heard about it and we haven t heard so maybe it s not in our product categories rosemarie morbelli g research analyst ok and then going back to the price of oil coming down how long will it take are you in fifo first of all how long will it take for you to benefit from those costs i know that the intermediary has to come down as well but it sounds though as a maybe and so let s say that you benefit from it in a 90 to 120 days as jay mentioned will you at that point have to give that price jay rembolt vice president and chief financial officer pricing wise we have a very our current pricing structures in place and we see no reason to change that current pricing structure you re right about that it is about 90 to 120 days we are on fifo with in that time between when it s when the new lower material costs come into our manufacturing facility and by the time it gets through to us inventory and on the end it s 90 120 days maybe a little bit more so which is why we haven t really made any changes to the guidance going out garry ridge president and chief executive officer if we do see any impact of a sustained lower oil price we wouldn t expect that to be seen until the third quarter right now our cost of goods are really reflecting the oil price in what months jay july august jay rembolt vice president and chief financial officer july august garry ridge president and chief executive officer which were at that high period that was when it was in the high 70s so we ve got the period of we would not expect to see any impact on the third quarter jay rembolt vice president and chief financial officer yes and you re right garry even if you re going to reflect we didn t start seeing any real decrease until after the november period so it was like november that we started seeing it so yes we will we ll still have some of these higher costs for a period garry ridge president and chief executive officer and this is why we have a little uncertainty around oil it than a week ago it was 42 today it s 52 and three weeks ago it was 60 and five weeks ago it was 75 so as we said we need to work out whether this is a series of events or whether it is sustainable trend rosemarie morbelli g research analyst you re right and in this environment it s hard to know garry ridge president and chief executive officer that would be a true statement rosemarie morbelli g research analyst maybe you should take up tweaking garry ridge president and chief executive officer i ll leave that one alone rosemarie morbelli g research analyst so now i was just wondering if during the quarter you had any surprises whether positive or negative and then garry you d talked about seeing growth following your digital optimization and if you could give us some idea as to how much growth is coming in that category garry ridge president and chief executive officer no 1 is no we didn t see really any surprises it kind of played out pretty well to the way we thought it would we haven t grown we haven t yet and i m not sure whether we will be pulling out and disclosing the digital ad on its own what we can say is that we are day by day taking a larger and more aggressive presence in the e commerce segment and we are very comfortable and happy with the growth we re getting out of that area rosemarie morbelli g research analyst ok great thank you good luck for the rest of the year and happy new year garry ridge president and chief executive officer thank you jay rembolt vice president and chief financial officer and happy new year operator

via bloomberg hat just happened i last wrote one of these newsletters on dec 20 the day after the last federal reserve monetary meeting more on my disappearance later in this commentary since that date stocks have staged a spectacular decline worldwide accompanied by an equally spectacular rally in government bonds that has pushed yields lower however there has been an emphatic bounce in stocks bond yields and the price of oil that was only briefly interrupted by apple inc s disappointing announcement that iphone sales had fallen below projections nevertheless the reversal in markets was given extra fuel on friday when the monthly u s employment report came in stronger than forecast and fed chairman jerome powell made remarks at a panel that were widely and in my view correctly seen as an attempt to walk back some hawkish comments he made on dec 19 as the central bank raised interest rates for the fourth time in 2018 it would be absurd to claim that the fed had nothing to do with the market ructions of the last few weeks what the fed does and says is always of paramount importance to markets and it was plain that powell s comments on dec 19 about continuing to reduce the size of the fed s balance sheet assets despite the market turbulence and thus at the margin reducing the demand for bonds and riskier financial assets had come as a nasty surprise for many but we cannot attribute all of this to some botched communications by a fed chairman who has still not completed his first year in the job the december sell off began after powell had given a notably dovish speech in new york which was interpreted as such at the time and it is not as though the world s markets have all obediently returned to their levels of the morning of dec 19 rather if you want to view it as just a huge but necessary and healthy correction there is a surprising amount of evidence on your side first the epicenter of this correction was plainly the u s this is how the s p 500 has fared compared to msci s index for the rest of the world this decade the u s plainly finds itself as the driving force for the world economy at the moment but there are limits to how long this can last even after the sharp correction relative to the rest of the world the worst it has suffered since 2011 u s stocks have still outpaced their global peers by more than 100 percent this decade this correction could have further to go and the december federal open market committee meeting may have provided a catalyst for people to realize that the u s is in a catch 22 either its economy can continue to expand while others stagnate in which case the fed will have to tighten monetary policy further and really spoil things for investors or it cannot in which case stocks are still too expensive this is also one of those rare times when emerging markets have managed to outperform the developed world even as developed world stock markets are falling almost invariably healthy conditions in the developed world have in the past been a necessary condition for emerging markets to outperform going back to 2000 as this chart shows the last month has seen the strongest performance for emerging markets when developed markets are weak we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us what explains this the hawkish dec 19 fomc meeting should have damaged emerging market assets higher u s bond yields and a stronger dollar have a well documented tendency to inflict pain as well this looks like a correction where investors simply grasped that their bet on a resurgent u s while everyone else had suffered had gone beyond the bounds of logic the charts suggest there is room for this correction to continue looking at raw valuation data for the u s we again come up with a plausible case that what we just witnessed was a drastic but welcome correction earnings have been boosted by the one off impact of the corporate tax cut and by a widening of profit margins looking at stock valuations as a multiple of sales the u s reached a level of overvaluation last january only seen once before in the last three decades during the dot com bubble of 1999 and 2000 declines as sharp as this one have happened only during the major bear markets that followed the peaks of 2000 and 2007 so the argument in terms of valuation does not necessarily suggest that this was merely a correction and that everyone can now relax if you are one of the many who view the rally of this decade as primarily a byproduct of the fed s quantitative easing measures that pumped trillions of dollars into the financial system we should brace for a continuing return to normality in valuations even if powell is trying to sound less hawkish he is not going to resort to more qe unless the financial markets stage a full blown collapse exactly how much have financial conditions loosened both inflation expectations and nominal rates have dropped significantly and real long term rates my favorite measure of financial pressure have corrected slightly after a brief trip above 1 percent in real rates in what appeared to be a true break out investors seem to have decided that that was more than the market could stand what of the underlying view of the economy that comes from the markets the outlook still looks bearish and possibly too bearish given the strength of the latest u s employment data the relative performance of the tech sector thanks to apple is right down around its lows from mid december its leadership is sorely missed meanwhile the underperformance of big banks continues apace this has much to do with a yield curve that is still as flat as iowa but it is a telling sign of lack of confidence where does all this leave us regrettably this does not look like a sell off and recovery sparked by rookie errors from the new chair of the fed rather it looks like a necessary and healthy correction to a market that had reached untenable levels catalyzed and exacerbated by the powell comments the sell off on christmas eve did have the look of revulsion or catharsis about it which implies a positive but we have already enjoyed quite a bounce and some of the underlying illogicalities of the market remain in place we can expect further corrections and further volatility no matter how powell measures his words full article

by lucio blanco pitlo iii the united states china trade war is creating a new dimension for power rivalry in southeast asia china s belt and road initiative and america s indo pacific strategy may receive fresh impetus as companies in both countries seek out new frontiers although an uneasy truce between president trump and xi was reached in buenos aires it will soon be tested as such u s and chinese firms will continue to relocate to southeast asia or expand their existing footprint in the region the region is well poised to absorb re directed trade and investment flows from the world s two largest economies for southeast asia the trade war can also kick start much needed reforms or accelerate the pace of present efforts to boost competitiveness however due to uneven levels of development and diversity some countries are better positioned to benefit from the trade war than others southeast asia is dynamic and robust it has a youthful population with a large labor age force large consumer demand increasing infrastructure investments and relative political stability based on world bank 2017 figures 68 of the region s population is between 15 and 64 ac nielsen estimates the region s middle class will reach 400 million by 2020 doubling 2012 figures regional economies are increasingly more competitive the world economic forum 2017 18 global competitiveness index showed modest gains one two notches in the rankings made by malaysia philippines and thailand compared to their previous year s performance while brunei indonesia and vietnam made impressive strides five and

singapore s gvc participation rate at 76 malaysia s at 64 philippines at 58 thailand s at 52 and vietnam s at 51 thailand malaysia vietnam indonesia and the philippines are also among the top exporting countries from the developing world all these contribute in making the region attractive to foreign capital not least from trade war protagonists such as the u s and china china and the u s

includes fourth ranked malaysia up from 20th in 2015 thailand ranked 18th in 2017 from 38th in 2015 indonesia ranked 26th from 44th in 2015 philippines ranked 28th from 39th in 2015 and vietnam ranked 30th from 40th in 2015 breaking down china s global sectoral investments by country will further reveal the region s significance for its big northern neighbor vietnam was the fifth largest target market for chinese investments in the automobile sector while singapore is the third largest market for financial services in terms of consumer goods malaysia vietnam singapore philippines and indonesia were ranked second fourth fifth sixth and ninth top markets respectively in the energy field vietnam indonesia philippines and thailand were ranked fourth fifth sixth and eighth largest markets respectively in addition philippines and malaysia accounted for the ninth and tenth largest telecoms markets for chinese enterprises china s proximity financial largesse surplus capacity formal mechanisms such as the asean china free trade agreement and initiatives like the belt and road support its economic diplomacy in the region choosing jakarta as the venue to announce the 21st century maritime silk road and the asian infrastructure investment bank back in 2013 also demonstrate the importance china attaches to the region the completion of the singapore kunming railway project which jives with the asean master plan for connectivity will further integrate mainland southeast asia with china likewise investments into industrial park and port infrastructure e g kuantan and melaka in malaysia kyaukpyu in myanmar sihanoukville in cambodia interest in indonesian port projects like new priok and kendal and in thailand s kra canal project will position china as a facilitator of regional connectivity in contrast less institutional arrangements e g the asean us trade and investment framework agreement and expanded economic engagement perceptions of retrenchment and the less pronounced economic dimension of the indo pacific strategy present challenges for continued u s engagement with the region while efforts to leverage private finance and collaboration with partners like japan and australia to meet the region s burgeoning demand for infrastructure funding are welcomed delays in mobilizing private capital and its higher risk aversion heighten the advantage of state capital that said commitment to established standards and greater opportunities for local content apparently constitute the pros of private financing although relatively small the u s announcement of a 113 million down payment for infrastructure technology and energy investments in the region was welcomed as it has the potential to catalyze private capital flows the structure of its external trade provides some cushion and opportunities for southeast asia electrical machinery and equipment and parts thereof constitute the top class of goods traded by the region with both the u s and china accounting for close to 30 of its trade with china and a quarter of its trade with the u s deep integration in the value chain and increasingly higher value added ensure greater resilience amidst the raging trade war compared to churning out easily substitutable low end goods such as agricultural exports the presence of downstream ecosystem in the region may also entice more manufacturers to head south furthermore despite america s increasing preference for bilateralism under the trump administration southeast asia s active interest in multilateral free trade agreements will still offer benefits for the region malaysia singapore and vietnam are signatories march 2018 to the rebranded comprehensive and progressive trans pacific partnership cptpp with singapore ratifying last july indonesia philippines and thailand also expressed their interest to join the trade pact the ten country bloc are also actively taking part in negotiations for the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep the first summit was held in manila last year and the agreement is expected to be signed this november in singapore the u s is curiously absent in both the cptpp and rcep although president trump did raise the possibility of the u s rejoining the cptpp if terms can be renegotiated to benefit american interests as the trade war intensifies southeast asia is finding ways to adjust and adapt accordingly countries which already have a higher trade and investment portfolio with both the u s and china are expected to get even more investment vietnam malaysia and thailand are china s top trading partners in the region and not surprisingly these countries are also among america s biggest trade partners in the region while these countries have their own unique developmental milieus they share several elements in development strategies such as continued institutional capacity building and infrastructure investments as such countries that were early to address basic developmental requirements now enjoy some competitive headway compared to their peers this said other regional countries are not sitting idly by and are instead taking their own measures to ensure that they can turn the us china trade war into an opportunity this article appeared at china us focus
consumer and producer prices decelerated sharply in china last month compounding the challenge for beijing in boosting sluggish demand in a deepening economic downturn consumer prices rose in december at their slowest pace in six months 1 9 from a year earlier by china s benchmark index while prices charged by producers increased by the lowest rate in two years at 0 9 according to official data released thursday with those readings more economists are sounding the alarm about the rising risk of deflation in the chinese economy with slumping prices potentially eating into corporate earnings and hurting companies ability to repay debts the disappointing price data reinforces market concerns over deflation as domestic demand weakens and economic growth slows said lin shu an economist with china merchants securities weak prices add to the trail of recent bad news with indicators such as factory orders retail sales and exports pointing to a slowing economy long buoyant property prices are softening the stuttering economy has increased pressure on beijing to resolve the trade fight with washington something both sides made progress on this week in order to remove an uncertainty for investors to arrest the slowdown beijing is ramping up infrastructure spending freeing up bank funds for lending and taking other measures to support private companies and consumer spending at a cabinet meeting on wednesday premier li keqiang announced fresh measures to cut taxes for small firms and urged local governments to accelerate bond issuance to support construction of public projects tommy xie an economist at ocbc said the easing measures send a strong signal to stabilize short term growth and should work better he said he s optimistic about growth expecting the economy to expand between 6 2 and 6 3 this year from a projected 6 6 last year some economists think the rate of actual growth is half that pace or lower december s readings for the consumer and producer price indexes both came in lower than most economists expected many pointed to the fall in producer prices as a concern the producer price index rise of 0 9 was a sharp descent from november s 2 7 and was the slowest gain since september 2016 when it inched up 0 1 after staying in deflation territory for more than four years an official campaign to reduce excess capacity in industrial sectors such as coal and steel helped to boost prices the main drag on producer prices last month was the weakening price of energy oil and natural gas prices rose 4 5 last month following a 24 4 surge in november the statistics bureau said for all of 2018 the ppi climbed 3 5 after surging 6 3 in 2017 a sharp slowdown in industrial prices threatens to erode company profits which have been resilient for most of 2018 despite the economic slowdown industrial profits declined in november for the first time in almost three years latest official data showed corporate earnings will probably continue to fall in the coming months forcing companies to cut inventory stocks and exerting more downward pressure on growth said ting lu an economist at nomura mr lin of merchants securities said the producer price index could sink again into to deflationary territory this year if the index drops by more than 2 year over year china s central bank may cut benchmark interest rates to stoke demand if oil prices continue to rebound however that may ease some deflationary pressure he said chinese consumers also felt the impact of cheaper oil prices gasoline and diesel prices dropped 0 5 and 0 3 respectively reversing november s increases of 12 8 and 14 2 the national statistics bureau said food prices rose 2 5 from a year earlier holding steady from november for all of 2018 the cpi rose 2 1 after rising 1 6 in 2017 below a government target to keep inflation under about 3 for 2018 source dow jones
asia pacific is the world s largest aviation market and overall has performed strongly again this year but there are pockets of weakness in some markets that look set to roll on into 2019 during a recent interview with flightglobal boc aviation chief executive robert martin noted that while the airline industry continues to be strong this is being driven by the fortunes of the american and largest european carriers you have some other carriers who are in the weaker developing markets who may have a foreign exchange issue he adds they are getting hit by a strong dollar and obviously fuel is in us dollars rising us dollar interest rates on their aircraft financing rising domestic interest rates on their working capital financing and they may have been hit with some delays over the summer for instance carriers in india and indonesia have been feeling the impact of the stronger dollar against their local currencies which has exacerbated costs and started draining cash china as the powerhouse of the asia pacific market continues to grow strongly but a major cloud over the trade relations with the usa a market in which chinese carriers have grown strongly in over the past few years remains indian carriers reel as capacity and costs grow india may be one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world but the last year saw carriers struggle to pass on higher costs to passengers resulting in more strain on their balance sheets stronger fuel prices in 2018 were felt particularly hard in the indian market with the double whammy of a depreciating home currency which further increased fuel and other us dollar denominated costs speaking during the airline s earnings call in october market leader indigo s chief financial officer rohit philip cited those higher costs for a fall to a pre tax loss of rs10 billion for the quarter ended september unfortunately these higher input costs have not been recovered as fares remain low due to continued intense competition he also pointed to a change in passenger behaviour over the year which has seen fares closer to the departure date fall the 0 15 day booking window remains weak with lower fares compared to the same period last year this has been further accentuated by the significant increase in capacity in the market flightglobal schedules data shows that capacity has grown by 18 between 2017 and 2018 forward filed schedules for the year to november 2019 indicate that there will be at least 10 more asms added to the market over the next 12 months those market conditions led local credit ratings agency icra to downgrade its ratings on indigo although it has acknowledged that the budget carrier is best placed among india s airlines to weather the storm thanks to its strong liquidity and focus on cost controls while backing its position indigo has signalled that it is reversing earlier plans to take more aircraft onto its balance sheet and will extend its sale and leaseback programme on its airbus a320neos in order to preserve its cash the situation is much more challenging at jet airways which has been forced to delay salary payments seek advances on sale and leaseback payments and go on the hunt for new equity in august it confirmed that it had received 300 million in advance payments from lessors likely related to sale and leasebacks on its boeing 737 max 8s at the same time the carrier also confirmed that it was in arrears to lessors on some of its other aircraft lease payments jet has also pointed to further potential to unlock capital from sale and leasebacks on its 777 300ers operating cost improvements from its new narrowbody jets and plans to wet lease atr 72s to indian regional carrier truejet however the wet lease deal looked to have collapsed at the end of 2018 adding to the carrier s pain it confirmed on 31 december that it had defaulted on payments to a consortium of local banks attributing the repayment delays to a cash flow mismatch this prompted credit agency icra to downgrade the carrier s long term loans and non convertible debentures ratings from c to d jet is not alone in relying on sale and leaseback payments to finance operations ratings agency crisil revealed in october that spicejet s cash was under pressure as deliveries of its own 737 max 8s had delayed some payments and it too had sought relief from lessors on overdue rentals on some aircraft despite the challenges facing india s airlines and the continuing growth in capacity there is optimism that the depressed yield environment will turn around in early 2019 the economy is healthy in india and we continue to see demand growing in the 20 range so things may be out of balance a little bit in the short term but with that pace of demand growth we are comfortable that it is going to get back in balance really soon says indigo senior advisor greg taylor what is less certain is the fate of air india following its unsuccessful privatisation attempt in 2018 which failed to yield a single bid for the 76 of the airline on offer it has been reportedly seeking new capital infusions from the government and capital lines from banks as it seeks to reverse years of losses and a major debt load consolidation in indonesia after rupiah rout the crash of a lion air boeing 737 max 8 in late october rounded out a challenging 2018 for indonesian carriers largely driven by a 10 fall in the value of the rupiah over the past year and continuing yield pressures xe com currency data shows that the rupiah traded around idr13 500 to the dollar in january however in october that blew out to idr15 500 commentators have largely blamed the decline of the rupiah on foreign investors selling indonesian assets spurred by rising us interest rates and fears that emerging market risk from turkey and argentina could spread to other emerging economies towards the end of the year the rupiah strengthened to around 14 500 perhaps signalling that the contagion threat is over blown nonetheless the currency is still well off the average trading range over the past few years for most indonesian carriers which sell most of their tickets revenue in rupiah the declines in that currency have caused fuel leasing and maintenance costs typically paid in dollars to shoot up at the same time yields have continued softening creating a massive headache for airlines sriwijaya air s director of corporate planning and business development jefferson jauwena explained in february that air fares on some routes in the country are now cheaper than bus fares and floor prices were not being effectively regulated while there is a price floor this is not being monitored or controlled by the government the price war is just getting crazier every day he added over the year however there was little sign of jakarta stepping in to enforce the price floor more strictly with most carriers still noting yield pressures garuda indonesia chief executive ari askhara told flightglobal in december that there was a need to fix the ecosystem in the domestic market for the benefit of all carriers consolidation appears to be a major part of the answer with garuda announcing a tie up with privately owned carrier sriwijaya air under which its budget unit citilink will take over operational control of sriwijaya and its nam air regional unit garuda is not planning to take a stake in sriwijaya but will appoint five of its seven board directors and three of its seven commissioners says askhara who will himself serve as chairman he adds that the deal will give garuda a 51 share of the domestic market which for many years prior had been dominated by low cost rival lion air maybank investment bank analyst mohshin aziz welcomed the deal telling flightglobal that it would bring some much needed sanity to the market indonesia has always needed consolidation there are just too many airlines there for sriwijaya to be consolidated with another airline makes perfect sense to be bigger is better despite holding a dominant position in the domestic market lion air group also appears to be suffering due to the same conditions plaguing its rivals while the carrier does not disclose numbers its strong use of sale and leasebacks and some sales of on order jets to lessors for placement with other airlines demonstrates that it too has had to pull levers to ensure it has the cash to finance its day to day operations moreover the crash of flight jt610 shortly after take off from jakarta s soekarno hatta international airport on 26 october is also likely to put the carrier under renewed pressure while there have been concerns about the role that certain systems on the boeing 737 max 8 played in the crash the initial report from indonesia s national transportation safety committee highlighted safety deficiencies in its operations boeing also took the unusual step of commenting on the report which some have interpreted as an attack on the carrier lion air group founder rusdi kirana has responded by threatening to cancel hundreds of 737 maxes it still has on order still some believe that it is a tactic aimed at slowing its planned deliveries to deal with the challenges in the indonesian market china strong but trade wars a risk worth watching china remains the world s strongest aviation market but there are concerns that a slowing economy caused by a potential trade war with the usa could have some impact on passenger demand to date the impact of the simmering trade tensions has done little to unnerve the aviation industry any impact was expected to be felt first by air freight operators but the tariffs that the us has put on chinese goods to date have mostly been on commodities and other goods that are rarely shipped by air the risk that tariffs may pave the way for other restrictions such as withdrawing the mutual 10 year visas available between the two countries could have a much greater impact on passenger traffic flightglobal schedules data shows that between 2013 and 2018 capacity on us china routes grew an average of 16 most of which was added by chinese carriers in some cases underwritten by subsidies by provincial and municipal governments in china more immediately a number of chinese carriers have significantly boosted their short term debt this year most of that has been in ultra short and medium term bond issuances in the domestic market where state backed carriers have been able to achieve coupon rates in the 3 4 per annum range while hainan airlines has accepted coupons in the 6 7 range the hna group carrier has been beset by its own challenges brought on by swelling liabilities at its parent company during the past year which has seen its bond rates rise in one case its latest 100 million overseas bond offering attracted an eye watering 12 coupon rate while still profitable for the year to september hainan appeared to be positioning to sell stakes in some of its domestic units with a deal struck to reduce its stake in urumqi air to 30 by selling a block to a unit of the provincial government that has been offset partially by new equity issues by china southern china eastern and air china over the past year all three received capital injections from their parent holding companies and other state owned enterprises in the case of china southern and china eastern privately owned rivals spring airlines and juneyao airlines respectively took minor stakes in those carriers reflecting a policy move by beijing aimed at attracting more private capital into state owned enterpises but larger reforms are occurring in the passenger market in october the first stages of liberalising the long held policy of limiting most routes to one chinese operator started which could spur a new stage of competition among the big three carriers a litmus test of that competition will come in late 2019 when beijing daxing airport opens with china eastern and china southern both planning to use the new airport as a major hub providing an alternative to air china s dominance of beijing capital international airport source cirium dashboard

last fiscal year net income for the first quarter was 13 3 million compared to 12 6 million in the first quarter of last fiscal year an increase of 5 year over year diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were 0 95 compared to 0 90 for the same period last year now let s start with a discussion about our strategic initiatives and the brands that support many of them our long term revenue growth targets are aspirational but we continue to believe that with enough sweat determination and hard work they are achievable we aspire to drive consolidated net sales to approximately 700 million in revenue by the end of fiscal 2025 and in doing so we will follow our 55 30 25 business model we refer to the brands that are going to get us there as our 2025 brands they are wd 40 multi use product wd 40 specialist 3 in one wd 40 bike gt85 1001 spot shot solvol lava and novick our 2025 brands are our core strategic focus for the primary growth engine for the company strategic initiative no 1 is to grow wd 40 multi use product our goal under this initiative is to make the blue and yellow can with the little red top available to more people in more places who will find more uses more often in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 sales of wd 40 multi use product was 78 3 million up 5 compared to the first quarter of last year this reflects excellent progress toward our most important strategic initiative to grow wd 40 multi use product to approximately 530 million in revenue by the end of fiscal year 2025 strategic initiative no 2 is to grow the wd 40 specialist product line in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 sales of wd 40 specialist were 8 4 million up 13 compared to the first quarter of last year this continues to move the company toward its goal for this initiative growing the product line to approximately 100 million in revenue by the end of fiscal 2025 we are optimistic about the long term opportunities for wd 40 specialist however there may be some volatility in sales levels along the way due to the timing of promotional programs the building of distribution and various other factors that come with building out a new product line our tribe has delivered some best in class wd 40 specialist products over the last several years as a result we now have an exceptional portfolio of products that we are proud to have way of the wd 40 shield it s now time to maximize the pipeline of products we have developed by enhancing their distribution through focused and deliberate geographic expansion strategic initiative no 3 is to broaden product and revenue base strategic initiative no 3 includes maintenance products like 3 in one wd 40 bike and gt85 but it also includes brands such as spot shot lava in the americas 1001 in emea and novick and solvol in australia pacific we believe we are on track to reach a combined revenue of approximately 70 million by 2025 these sales under this strategic initiative were 12 million in the first quarter up 1 compared to last year we spent the last several years better understanding how each of these brands perform in their own unique channels and geographies and many of them generate sizable revenues and they all generate meaningful profit contribution cash flows strategic initiative no 4 is to attract develop and retain outstanding tribe members our goal under this initiative is to attract develop and retain talented tribe members and to grow tribe member engagement to greater than 95 in the last 12 months we ve increased our focus on digital and physical brand building activities with a heightened focus on digital and e commerce and in support of that effort we have hired half a dozen new tribe members with expertise in e commerce digital marketing and digital channel strategy our efforts under this initiative were recently acknowledged in the wall street journal article written by sue shellenbarger in the article she writes about how today s employees seek a place of belonging and the companies which excel and engage in their employees posted profit gains through the last recession of 26 compared with a 14 decline at comparable employees at wd 40 company i am certain that our financial successes lean directly to our outstanding tribe members and their exceptional motivation and dedication nurturing and growing that engagement will continue to be a top priority for us in fiscal year and the years to come strategic initiative no 5 is operational excellence at wd 40 company our cornerstone to operational excellence ties closely to one of our core values at wd 40 company which is to make it better than it is today while this is our guiding mantra we continuously focus on optimizing resources systems and processes while applying a rigorous commitment to quality assurance regulatory compliance and intellectual property protection using our 55 30 25 business model as a framework we measure ourselves against this operational excellence initiative i m really excited to share with you that this month we ll be opening our brand new technology center in prime new jersey our technology center will house our new jersey based tribe members and will provide them with a work environment that to conduct laboratory tested base tested research and development in house not only does this new facility provide our r d staff with a modern and functional work environment it also provides us with the opportunity to bring that work in house as much of the scientific and testing work that was performed in the past was now going to be performed in our new laboratory which had historically been outsourced our new tech center is a shining example of our continued focus on making it better than it is today that completes the update on our strategic initiatives so let s move on to the details of our first quarter starting with sales as i mentioned earlier consolidated net sales were 101 3 million in the first quarter up 3 7 million or 4 versus the first quarter of last year translation of foreign subsidiary results from their functional currencies to the u s dollar had an unfavorable impact on sales in the first quarter on a constant currency basis net sales would have been 102 4 million in the first quarter up 4 8 million or 5 compared to last year before i discuss what s happening in each of the individual segments i d like to take a moment to remind investors that though we do not consider our business to be a seasonal one it s common for our sales results to fluctuate one period to another due to various factors including the level of promotional activities specific programs being run at customer locations the timing of customer orders or the impact of new product launches this is all a normal part of our business and we are accustomed to these types of fluctuations and manage them as part of their normal business activities it is when something a little out of the ordinary happens that we discuss it in much greater detail here with our investors so let s start with the americas net sales in the americas which includes the united states latin america and canada increased to 47 8 million in the first quarter up about 4 from last year sales of maintenance products increased 7 or 2 7 million in the americas primarily due to higher sales of wd 40 multi use product and wd 40 specialist in the united states maintenance product sales in the united states increased 9 or 2 8 million in the first quarter primarily due to strong sales of wd 40 ez reach the timing of promotional programs as well as an expanded distribution in the online industrial and farm channels in the u s wd 40 specialist sales were up 32 in the first quarter primarily due to a successful holiday gift pack promotion we ran in the country partially offsetting these increases were declines in sales of maintenance products in both canada and in latin america in both canada and latin america maintenance product sales were down 2 during the quarter primarily due to the timing of customer orders as a reminder our maintenance products exclude our home care and cleaning products sales of our home care and cleaning product in the americas decreased 17 in the first quarter compared to the prior year largely due to lower sales of 2 000 flushes and carpet fresh in the u s which declined 35 and 46 respectively we continue to consider our home care and cleaning products except for those listed as 2025 brands as half those brands that continue to generate meaningful contributions and cash flows but are generally expected to become a smaller part of the business over time in total our americas segment made up 47 of our global sales over the long term we anticipate sales within this segment will grow between 2 to 5 annually now on to emea net sales in emea which includes europe the middle east africa and india increased to 38 7 million in the first quarter up 11 from last year emea s reported results in the first quarter were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates on a constant currency basis sales in emea would have increased to 39 3 million in the first quarter up 12 from last year transaction related impacts in emea were insignificant in this quarter we sell into emea through a combination of direct operations as well as through marketing distributors net sales in our emea direct markets which accounted for 64 of the region s sales increased 10 during the first quarter to 24 8 million this growth was a result of increased sales of wd 40 multi use product throughout most of the emea direct markets due to a higher level of promotional activities increased distribution and the timing of customer orders net sales in emea were also positively impacted in the quarter by a 40 increase in sales in home care and cleaning products during the quarter which was due to a successful digital promotion we ran in the united kingdom for our 1001 carpet fresh product net sales in emea distributor markets which accounted for 36 of the region s sales increased 11 during the quarter to 14 million this increase was primarily due to increased sales of wd 40 multi use product in eastern europe because of the improved economic conditions in the region as well as the timing of customer orders also contributing to the increase in sales were higher sales of multi use product in india due to the higher level of distribution supported by our increased investment in branding activities the emea segment made up 38 of our global business over the long term we expect the segment will grow our sales between 8 and 10 annually now down to asia pacific consolidated net sales in asia pacific which includes australia china and countries in other countries in the asian region decreased to 14 7 million in the first quarter down 10 from last year changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on sales in the region on a constant currency basis sales in asia pacific would have decreased to 15 2 million in the first quarter down 7 from last year in australia net sales were 3 9 million in the first quarter down 13 compared to last year changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on sales in the region of australia on a constant currency basis sales in australia decreased 6 compared to last year the decrease in sales during the first quarter was due primarily to the timing of customer orders and decreased promotional activities in our asia distributor market net sales were 7 8 million in the first quarter down 13 compared to the last year primarily due to the timing of customer orders we had a very strong fourth quarter and the first quarter is a reflection of a bit of a hangover from that activity our asian distributor markets are not impacted by currency since we sell our product in the u s in u s dollars in the region in china net sales in the u s dollars were 3 million in the first quarter up 4 compared to last year on a constant currency basis sales in china increased 9 compared to last year due to successful promotional programs that were conducted in the first quarter of this year we remain optimistic about the long term opportunities in china although expect a lot of volatility going away due to the timing of promotional programs the building of distribution shifting economic condition economic patterns and varying industrial activities the asia pacific segment made up 15 of our global business over the long term we expect sales within the segment will grow between 10 and 12 annually that s it for me for now i ll turn it over to jay who will continue with a review of the financials jay rembolt vice president and chief financial officer thanks garry first let s start with a review of our 55 30 25 business model the long term targets we use to guide our business as you may recall the 55 represents gross margin which we target to be at 55 of net sales the 30 represents our cost of doing business which is our total operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization our goal is to drive our cost of doing business over time toward 30 of net sales and then finally the 25 represents our target for ebitda well first the 55 or our gross margin in the first quarter our gross margin was 55 1 compared to 55 5 last year this represented a decline of 40 basis points changes in major input costs which include petroleum based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans were there primary driver of this decline and negatively impacted our gross margin by 200 basis points as a reminder there s often about a 90 to 120 day lag or more before changes in raw material costs impact our cost of goods sold due to production and inventory life cycles the average cost of raw materials that flowed through our cost of goods in the first quarter was higher this year compared to the first quarter last year which put pressure on gross margin in all three trading blocks petroleum based specialty chemical costs negatively impacted our gross margin by 160 basis points period over period also contributing negatively to the gross margin of 40 basis points was the increased cost of aerosol cans these negative impacts to gross margin were partially offset by the favorable effects of price increases which we ve implemented in all three trading blocks over the last 12 months and which positively impacted gross margin by 120 basis points in the first quarter sales and exchanges and other miscellaneous costs also positively impacted our gross margin by 40 basis points this is driven by lower inbound freight costs and favorable sales and exchanges as we continue to increase sales of premium products like wd 40 smart straw ez reach and wd 40 specialist as a reminder our long term gross margin target of 55 is not contingent upon commodity prices staying at any particular price point we cannot control the global market dynamics but we can continue to be focused and deliver in managing the rest of our business so that we can maintain gross margin at or above our target of 55 over the long term now look at the 30 or our cost of doing business in the first quarter our cost of doing business was approximately 37 compared to 36 last year the first quarter sg a increased 1 5 million and our advertising and promotional investment increased 900 000 which negatively impacted our cost of doing business percentage our sg a increased 5 compared to last year primarily due to higher employee related costs increased expenses associated with travel meetings and professional services as we ve shared with investors we ve increased our investments in advertising and promotion to support both physical and digital brand building initiatives in support of those initiatives our a p investment increased 17 year over year as a percentage of sales our a p investment was 5 9 in the first quarter compared to 5 2 last year for the first quarter 75 of our cost of doing business came from three areas people costs or the investments we make in our tribe the investments we make in marketing advertising and promotion and finally freight costs to get our products to our customers while our long term objective is to have our cost of doing business closer to our target of 30 of net sales we will continue to make necessary investments in support of our brand building activities and our fifth strategic initiative operational excellence ultimately revenue growth is the most important factor in helping us achieve our long term target of 30 this will bring us now to ebitda the last of our 55 30 25 measures ebitda was 18 of net sales in the first quarter of this year compared to 20 last year well that completes the discussion of our 55 30 25 business model for the current quarter now i ll look at some other items below ebitda the provision for income tax was 17 6 in the first quarter compared to 23 7 last year the decrease in the effective income tax rate was due to the favorable impact from the tax cuts and jobs act in the u s which became effective for us in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 we expect that our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2019 will be in the 21 to 22 range net income for the first quarter was 13 3 million versus 12 6 million in the prior year reflecting an increase of 5 this resulted in diluted earnings per common share of 0 95 in the first quarter compared to 0 90 in the same period last year and diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased to 13 9 million shares from 14 million shares a year ago now a word about capital allocation our capital allocation strategy includes a comprehensive approach to balance investing in long term growth while providing strong terms to stockholders our maintenance capex is usually between 1 and 2 of net sales but we are planning to make additional investments in fiscal 2019 in total we expect to invest about 22 million in capex this fiscal year in support of our fifth strategic initiativs operational excellence this includes regular maintenance capex and costs associated with completing the development of our new facilities in the united kingdom and new jersey additionally this investment will support an innovation that will enhance our end user experience lower our manufacturing costs and ultimately improve our gross margin we look forward to updating investors on this exciting innovation in the near future we understand the importance of regular dividends to our stockholders we target a dividend payout ratio of about 50 of net income on december 11 2018 our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0 61 per share reflecting an increase of 13 over the previous quarter s dividend of 0 54 a share this increase represents the ninth consecutive year the company has raised its dividend over which time the dividend has increased 144 based on today s closing price of 183 78 the annualized dividend yield is 1 3 during the first quarter we repurchased just over 41 000 shares of our stock at a total cost of 6 9 million under our current 75 million share repurchase plan which was approved by the board in june 2018 at the end of our first fiscal quarter we had 68 1 million remaining under the plan so with that let s turn to fiscal 2019 guidance our guidance remains unchanged from what we issued in october 2018 uncertainty around foreign exchange rates particularly the british pound and commodity prices are making it unusually challenging to forecast certain elements of our business if foreign exchange rates remain close to current levels for the remainder of fiscal 2019 we would expect net sales to be in the lower end of our guidance range in addition we have not updated our guidance to reflect today s lower crude oil prices because we have not yet determined if crude oil at less than 65 a barrel is an event or a trend additionally it s important to clarify that even though petroleum based specialty chemicals make up a significant portion approximately 35 of the input costs associated with the can of the wd 40 multi use product only a small portion of that is directly tied to the cost of crude oil this is because we do not buy crude oil we buy custom formulated specialty chemicals which have complex cost drivers including manufacturing region fixed product costs and distinctive supply and demand characteristics so though the current price of crude could be a net positive in our gross margin in future periods it s too early to determine when and by how much therefore our guidance remains unchanged sales growth is projected in our guidance sales growth is projected to be between 4 and 7 with net sales expected to be between 425 million and 437 million gross margin for the full year is expected to be near the 55 advertising and promotion investment is expected to be between 5 5 and 6 of net sales the provision for income tax is expected to be between 21 and 22 and net income projected to be between 62 2 million and 63 2 million diluted earnings per share is expected to be between 4 51 and 4 58 based on an estimated 13 8 million weighted average shares outstanding and note that this guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures and that completes the financial review now i ll turn it back to garry garry ridge president and chief executive officer hey thanks jay so let s sum up on what you heard from us on the call today you heard that we had a 4 global sales growth in the first quarter you heard that global sales of wd 40 multi use product grew 5 in the first quarter you heard that global sales of wd 40 specialist grew 13 in the first quarter you heard that we continue to make progress toward our long term revenue target which is to drive consolidated net sales for approximately 700 million in revenues by the end of fiscal year 2025 you heard that we ve increased our a p investment to support additional physical and digital brand building activities you heard that we are making some additional capital investments to support the development of our new facilities in milton keynes and in pinebrook as well as development of our new initiatives you heard that our board of directors increased our dividend by 13 last month and you heard that we have reiterated our fiscal year 2019 guidance however we acknowledge that there are some global dynamics which are entirely out of our control and may positively or negatively impact that guidance so in closing i d like to share with you a quote from colin powell a dream doesn t become reality through magic it takes sweat determination and hard work thank you for joining us today we d be pleased to now open the conference to your calls for questions wendy kelley director of investor relations and corporate communications operator questions and answers operator one moment for our first question our first question comes from the line of linda bolton weiser from d a davidson please proceed with your question linda bolton weiser d a davidson analyst hi happy new year garry ridge president and chief executive officer happy new year jay rembolt vice president and chief financial officer hi linda linda bolton weiser d a davidson analyst hi so i guess first of all can you first review because i m just getting back on board here so i don t have a recent memory of when was the rough time period when you first started to take price increases and then when was the most recent price increase taken garry ridge president and chief executive officer so in the united states our most recent price increase went into effect around the june and july period of last year with the total impact of that increase probably not realizing until well into the fourth quarter and then in other geographic locations particularly emea and asia pacific they were staged during the year depending on the country and then prior to that in the united states the last price rise we took i think was six years ago linda bolton weiser d a davidson analyst oh ok ok so then i mean the way things work here i mean they re fairly recent than you said these price increases so you would expect to hang on to them for a while even as we see this oil price roll over here we would expect the pricing to hold up a little bit longer i would think is that correct garry ridge president and chief executive officer we re not planning on making any changes to our pricing at this time linda bolton weiser d a davidson analyst ok and what was the rough magnitude of the pricing in the u s that you took garry ridge president and chief executive officer it was about 4 linda bolton weiser d a davidson analyst ok and then so you did really well in the quarter on the sales line the u s and emea looked really good and even though the comparison in the prior year period was quite difficult actually so can you just gave us a little more color on that and just as a general strength in the business anything in particular and then the comparisons actually getting easier in the second fiscal quarter so should we be expecting even stronger growth garry ridge president and chief executive officer we expect that growth for the year will be in line with our guidance overall as you know we don t really forecast quarter to quarter but in the first quarter as i shared in the u s it was a very nice quarter we saw growth in our core product wd 40 multi use product driven particularly around one of our new initiatives which is ez reach and also some growth in our specialist product around a special holiday pack that we trialed in the u s that we feel was reasonably successful in emea it was really across the board both made up of new distribution and the continual conversion of our classic can to our smart straw can in europe and as you might remember linda when we converted from classic to smart straw we get a revenue lift because of pricing and then of course there was a rebound in europe around our md markets in russia and eastern europe and we re starting also now to see some really nice sustainable growth out of india we ve been investing in india and we re starting to see some traction there and then overall linda as you might know we ve deliberately taken an investment opportunity in both digital and e commerce and we ve been seeing some good growth in our digital areas in asia pac where we didn t grow that well it was primarily our distributor markets and it was really a hangover from last quarter we had a very very strong q4 which was due to the distributors getting back on track after we ve made some changes there so we should see things in asia pacific start to normalize over the next three quarters and we anticipate we ll have revenue growth in asia pac in line with our expectations for the full year linda bolton weiser d a davidson analyst ok and then can you just i mean there s been a lot of investor anxiety i guess over the potential for a recession in the u s at least can you just remind me how your business behaves in a recession is it actually a little bit countercyclical or can you just give a little bit color about the nature of your business in that kind of environment garry ridge president and chief executive officer we re not recession proof but we have been called recession resistant and past history we ve been around for 30 years in the business we ve come through we continued to invest in our business through the recessions whether and the other thing that plays even more in our favor now is our geographic diversity in 2008 when we had the financial crisis our business was actually sideways we actually grew a little and if it wasn t for the collapse if you will of the pound u s dollar exchange rate we would have grown but the impact was more in the u s not in europe so let s hope that we don t talk ourselves into a recession and let s hope that we continue to make large hotdogs and put them on good buns and don t actually find ourselves in that position but we feel that our spread across geography and our spread across trade channels gives us the best chance we can possibly have through different economic conditions and different countries at different times around the world linda bolton weiser d a davidson analyst great and then just finally i know you ve kind of alluded to another new product innovation that you re working on are you still garry ridge president and chief executive officer yes linda bolton weiser d a davidson analyst are you still thinking that you might be able to talk about it in march and then when would the potential launch be garry ridge president and chief executive officer we will review all and reveal all in march so please be with us then because we re really excited linda bolton weiser d a davidson analyst and when do you think the launch would be of the product garry ridge president and chief executive officer we ll talk about that in march linda bolton weiser d a davidson analyst ok ok that s all for me thanks very much garry ridge president and chief executive officer thanks linda operator your next question comes from the line of daniel rizzo from jefferies please proceed with your question daniel rizzo jefferies analyst good afternoon everyone how are you garry ridge president and chief executive officer hi daniel daniel rizzo jefferies analyst hey you mentioned that in 2008 your business was sideways or just intact i guess are you saying that volumes held in and that it was just really fx i mean how did i guess how did pricing volumes act during such an environment were they down a little bit were they flat or just any color garry ridge president and chief executive officer 2008 it was really the major sideways is because of exchange rates and it was the exchange of the british pound to the u s dollar volumes were reasonably as far as i can remember now you re asking me to remember details 11 years ago that s pretty hard for me but i do know that the majority of the impact was exchange remember that jay jay rembolt vice president and chief financial officer yes the sterling collapsed by about 25 there was a very deep decline from the prior year to the from 2007 to 2008 and so a big big chunk of it came from the currency we saw growth in most of the european markets u s was a little bit u s was a little sideways if i remember specifically this a couple of channels had maybe a little bit more disruption than most but net net i think volumes across the board were about showed a little growth yes that s what i recall daniel rizzo jefferies analyst ok and then you guys talked about your digitization effort which seem to be going fairly well and i don t know if that s in the past but are you working with amazon i mean is that a distribution channel of yours or are you getting your own garry ridge president and chief executive officer yes daniel rizzo jefferies analyst it is garry ridge president and chief executive officer yes yes we re very engaged with amazon amazon is a direct customer of ours and i think they re in our top i don t know they re in the top 20 customer list with specialists particularly daniel rizzo jefferies analyst ok and then finally for free cash flow is there a seasonality threat just in terms of payments versus give and takes with working capital garry ridge president and chief executive officer there i m sure there s a few little tweaks but for the most part it isn t i mean there are times when you ve got some tax payments our growth reward program payments that in the grand scheme of things is very minor daniel rizzo jefferies analyst ok all right thank you very much garry ridge president and chief executive officer thanks daniel operator your next question comes from the line of rosemarie morbelli from g research please go ahead with your question rosemarie morbelli g research analyst thank you and good afternoon everyone garry ridge president and chief executive officer good afternoon rosemarie morbelli g research analyst i was wondering if you are seeing any impact from the trade war in china and if not is it because you are too small and it is not affecting you or any other reason garry ridge president and chief executive officer we are not really seeing any impact at all at this time we don t import much from china so the tariff side isn t working with us and it s kind of jay jay rembolt vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean there are some indirect impacts but it s hard to measure and it s hard to really stand down you ve got some hesitancy in a market to do something that a period of time but it doesn t feel like it s sustained rosemarie morbelli g research analyst ok and no impact i mean then i think that indonesia for example has put some tariff on chinese goods is that affecting you are you not in indonesia garry ridge president and chief executive officer no we have a very large business in indonesia but we ve seen no impact with any tariff i m not sure that it s impacting our product but in fact i don t think it is because we would have heard about it and we haven t heard so maybe it s not in our product categories rosemarie morbelli g research analyst ok and then going back to the price of oil coming down how long will it take are you in fifo first of all how long will it take for you to benefit from those costs i know that the intermediary has to come down as well but it sounds though as a maybe and so let s say that you benefit from it in a 90 to 120 days as jay mentioned will you at that point have to give that price jay rembolt vice president and chief financial officer pricing wise we have a very our current pricing structures in place and we see no reason to change that current pricing structure you re right about that it is about 90 to 120 days we are on fifo with in that time between when it s when the new lower material costs come into our manufacturing facility and by the time it gets through to us inventory and on the end it s 90 120 days maybe a little bit more so which is why we haven t really made any changes to the guidance going out garry ridge president and chief executive officer if we do see any impact of a sustained lower oil price we wouldn t expect that to be seen until the third quarter right now our cost of goods are really reflecting the oil price in what months jay july august jay rembolt vice president and chief financial officer july august garry ridge president and chief executive officer which were at that high period that was when it was in the high 70s so we ve got the period of we would not expect to see any impact on the third quarter jay rembolt vice president and chief financial officer yes and you re right garry even if you re going to reflect we didn t start seeing any real decrease until after the november period so it was like november that we started seeing it so yes we will we ll still have some of these higher costs for a period garry ridge president and chief executive officer and this is why we have a little uncertainty around oil it than a week ago it was 42 today it s 52 and three weeks ago it was 60 and five weeks ago it was 75 so as we said we need to work out whether this is a series of events or whether it is sustainable trend rosemarie morbelli g research analyst you re right and in this environment it s hard to know garry ridge president and chief executive officer that would be a true statement rosemarie morbelli g research analyst maybe you should take up tweaking garry ridge president and chief executive officer i ll leave that one alone rosemarie morbelli g research analyst so now i was just wondering if during the quarter you had any surprises whether positive or negative and then garry you d talked about seeing growth following your digital optimization and if you could give us some idea as to how much growth is coming in that category garry ridge president and chief executive officer no 1 is no we didn t see really any surprises it kind of played out pretty well to the way we thought it would we haven t grown we haven t yet and i m not sure whether we will be pulling out and disclosing the digital ad on its own what we can say is that we are day by day taking a larger and more aggressive presence in the e commerce segment and we are very comfortable and happy with the growth we re getting out of that area rosemarie morbelli g research analyst ok great thank you good luck for the rest of the year and happy new year garry ridge president and chief executive officer thank you jay rembolt vice president and chief financial officer and happy new year operator

trade tensions slowing emerging markets and weakening manufacturing indicate potential downturn economic growth in the us likely to slow following boost from tax cuts rising interest rates start to bite globally no deal brexit expected to reduce growth across uk eu and north africa the world bank has downgraded its forecast for global economic growth this year and next amid fears over stagnation in emerging markets rising trade tensions and weakening manufacturing activity the international financial institution s annual review is now predicting 2 9 per cent growth this year and 2 8 per cent for 2020 both representing a 0 1 per cent fall from forecasts made last june downside risks have become more acute said the bank s report disorderly financial market developments could disrupt activity in the affected economies and lead to contagion effects trade disputes could escalate or become more widespread denting activity in the economies involved and leading to negative global spill overs the bank s report ominously entitled darkening skies said the implications of an economic slowdown would probably be most keenly felt in low income countries that have failed to raise per capita incomes sufficiently while the report said that some nations such as india had seen a decline in the numbers in poverty progress had stalled in sub saharan africa which the world bank projects could hold as many as 87 per cent of the poorest people in the globe by 2030 in order to keep the global economy on an even keel the bank recommends that countries invest more in developing their residents skills ease restrictions on investment and reduce barriers to trade rather than raise them as the united states has recently done by imposing tariffs on 12 per cent of its goods imports reported cnn the united states is still among the best performing economies in the world but its growth streak could run out soon as the effects of the tax cuts and government spending wear off and the era of easy money fades further into the distance as the federal reserve raises interest rates although a recession isn t obviously around the corner a volatile political environment and mounting corporate debt loads are a toxic cocktail the bank stated the policy mix in the united states will shift from expansionary to contractionary during the forecast horizon with monetary fiscal and trade policies all expected to become a drag on activity within the next couple of years in this context relatively small negative shocks have the potential to abruptly end the current expansion rising interest rates were also found to be affecting emerging markets with governments and companies that borrowed heavily when rates were low in the aftermath of the recession a decade ago now having to re finance at higher rates the rise in the value of the dollar was also found to be hurting some emerging market borrowers global growth is slowing and the risks are rising said ayhan kose the world bank economist who oversees the forecast in 2017 the global economy was pretty much firing on all cylinders in 2018 the engines started sputtering the bank which markedly downgraded its 2019 forecast for growth in turkey argentina iran and pakistan among others left its forecast for the us economy unchanged at 2 5 per cent this year down from 2 9 per cent in 2018 it also predicted 1 6 per cent growth for the 19 eurozone countries down from 1 9 per cent last year and 6 2 per cent growth for china down from 6 5 per cent in 2018 franziska ohnsorge lead author of the report told the bbc in china its policy engineered a very deliberate slowdown towards more stable long term growth on brexit the bank see a possible risk for countries that are particularly reliant on selling to europe if there is a no deal brexit the bank said there could be significant economic damage to both the uk and the eu which could then have a knock on effect in eastern european and north african nations that are closely integrated with europe 2024 re locate magazine published by profile locations spray hill hastings road lamberhurst kent tn3 8jb all rights reserved this publication or any part thereof may not be reproduced in any form without the prior written permission of profile locations profile locations accepts no liability for the accuracy of the contents or any opinions expressed herein

briefing highlights more canadians going bust a transcanada scene i d love to see markets at a glance auto industry cuts european jobs from today s globe and mail insolvencies on rise more canadians are going bust as they grapple with higher interest rates but while more will probably collapse under the weights of their debts the situation won t get anywhere near as bad as it did during the recession and financial crisis of a decade ago bank of montreal stressed as it parsed the latest numbers and there s something of a reprieve in the bank of canada s signal that it s going to go slowly as it raises rates given the economic uncertainty of the day not only that many of us are adjusting as rates rise from the lows of the crisis era and then the oil shock certainly though this is a sign that higher rates will force canadians to cut back pressuring consumer spending while mortgage rate relief is expected canadian households are still feeling the pinch from climbing borrowing costs at a time when debt ratios remain near record highs bmo economic analyst priscilla thiagamoorthy said in a report at this point she added in an interview it s just a slight uptick in the numbers though the situation bears watching according to the office of the superintendent of bankruptcy canada consumer insolvencies climbed more than 5 per cent in november from a year earlier that followed an even bigger rise in october while bankruptcy data can be volatile taking the annual percentage change of the three month rolling tally shows a moderate upward shift ms thiagamoorthy said this along with recent declines in residential investment and car sales suggests that households the biggest segment of the economy are under some pressure she added insolvencies come in two forms one being outright bankruptcy and the other via proposals to settle debts by changing the credit terms and there s something of a story in that breakdown the number of proposals rose 12 1 per cent in november from a year earlier to 6 670 while bankruptcies declined 3 6 per cent to 4 650 both rose in october but proposals at a far faster pace those people may not be among the most tapped out because they re the ones taking the initiative to settle their debts ms thiagamoorthy said and we could see more coming out of the woodwork remember too she added that while rates have climbed gasoline prices have dipped so there s an offsetting impact for family finances derek holt head of capital markets economics at bank of nova scotia noted that bankruptcies are still near record lows proposals have increased and have been doing so for many years but the whole purpose to a proposal is to avoid bankruptcy or less dire stresses he said in fact mr holt added what s happening marks one of the great relative strengths of the canadian system against the u s program for example proposals are worked out through a willingness to restructure payments and debt without necessarily forcing the client into bankruptcy and seizing uncertain net asset values minus related costs mr holt said one extreme example of the difference is that strategic defaults generally don t exist in canada walking away with impunity is generally not an option versus working out one s obligations in a mutually satisfactory way he added this is not a new phenomenon it has been rising for years it can be an attractive way of working out challenges on both sides of the borrower lender relationship for instance lowered payments can be accompanied by longer amortizations or more efficient debt pooling to the mutual advantage of borrower and lender especially relative to the alternative u s system that proved to be utterly incapable of flexibly addressing challenges canadians are famous for their swollen debts though credit growth is slowing amid new mortgage qualification rules and higher rates but as bank of canada governor stephen poloz noted wednesday many canadians are juggling it canada s housing market he told reporters is taking its sweet time stabilizing possibly because of provincial measures aimed at cooling inflated prices or the combined effects of higher rates and new mortgage rules homebuyers are adapting by seeking smaller lower priced homes home sellers are offering lower prices and home builders are adapting to growing demand for smaller homes mr poloz said these adjustments are taking time so we need to continue to monitor the situation carefully he added but we must keep in mind that the markets in toronto and vancouver were exhibiting a degree of froth and it is always difficult to judge where the market will stabilize once froth has been removed his comments came after the central bank held its benchmark overnight rate steady at 1 75 per cent citing the troubles in

committed to getting interest rates back to neutral levels over time in a research note bank of america merril lynch said it expects the central bank to hike rates twice in 2019 after a detour with risks around that path mostly driven by oil prices because the boc interprets the negative shock to activity due to lower oil prices as temporary it is communicating a pause or a detour on its way to

this also means china will need to implement more transparent policies to attract foreign investors and relax capital flow restrictions so that they can repatriate their money china s shift to relying more on foreign money means the yuan s exchange rate will face increasing downward pressure over the longer term to ensure to ensure adequate inflows of capital the trade war with the united states is expected to accelerate an ongoing structural change in china s current account balance making it a capital importer that buys more from the rest of the world than it sells to it however china s efforts to open up its capital account have so far been lopsided as beijing encourages foreign investors to invest more money in the country while also continuing to strictly control capital outflows by chinese individuals and businesses official data for china s current account balance for 2018 due to be released in april is expected to show a modest surplus before falling into deficit in coming years analysts said that will be in sharp contrast to the large global surpluses that china posted until a few years ago after china s current account surplus peaked at us 420 billion or 9 9 per cent of gross domestic product gdp in 2007 before steadily declining the current account defined as the sum of the balance of trade goods and services exports minus imports net income from abroad and net current capital transfers is an important indicator of an economy s health china s evaporating current account reflects major transitions that the economy is going through said chen dong senior asia economist at pictet wealth management it is a long term issue that has to be monitored very closely chen estimated that the china s current account would post a small surplus of around us 24 billion in 2018 roughly equivalent to 0 2 per cent of gdp down from 1 3 per cent in 2017 the trade war looks set to further erode china s overall trade position in goods and services given that the surplus with the united states is larger than the country s overall surplus which is offset due to it having a deficit with other nations on wednesday china and the united states wrapped up three days of talks in the hopes of resolving their bilateral trade disputes although no details were provided on the progress made on the specific issues being discussed deputy us trade representative jeffrey gerrish led the american delegation in beijing photo reuters some manufacturers are moving supply chains out of china to avoid the us tariffs and rising production costs and any trade deal likely to increase chinese imports from the us may also lead to an increase of purchases from other countries chen said the shift of china s current account into deficit will result in a greater impact from changes in the yuan s exchange rate which is likely to face a structural downward pressure to attract investors even if the central bank continues to support the currency as a result china will lose some leeway to stimulate its economy using monetary policy easing as that would lead to a greater risk of yuan weakening than in the past said john greenwood chief economist at invesco china also will need to rely on foreign capital inflows to fund a current account deficit to avoid depleting foreign exchange reserves chen said official data showed this week that the nation s foreign exchange reserves fell us 67 24 billion during 2018 due to slowing economic growth and trade tensions with the united states improving the business environment and reducing entry barriers across industries will be increasingly important to encourage foreign direct investment such as tesla s new shanghai factory that broke ground on tuesday chen said you have to make china attractive to foreign investors and that is why you have to continue to push for reforms and to reduce barriers to allow foreign participation in industries he said to boost capital inflows chinese authorities have already opened up its onshore equity and bond markets to foreign investors through their bond connect and stock connect programmes robin xing chief china economist of morgan stanley estimated that foreigners could invest around us 400 billion in china s bond market in the coming years if government regulations and rules were improved to make domestic assets attractive china needs to make capital market supervision and capital flow regulation more transparent and consistent so investors can be fully reassured about the risks of investing in china said xing but so far china s efforts to encourage capital flows have favoured foreign investors at the expense of chinese investors while encouraging foreign investors to remit money into the country authorities are strictly controlling outflows by chinese individual and businesses the bond connect access scheme began to allow overseas investors to buy into the mainland s interbank bond market via hong kong in 2017 photo afp the bond connect access scheme began to allow overseas investors to buy into the mainland s interbank bond market via hong kong in 2017 however southbound trading allowing mainland investors to invest in hong kong and overseas markets remains closed with no time frame set for its launch to prevent chinese residents from exporting large amounts of funds overseas authorities will continue to enforce restrictions on capital outflows and trying to close up loopholes that circumvent official regulation each chinese resident is limited to just us 50 000 in foreign exchange conversions per year outboard investment also continue to be closely scrutinised and controlled with chinese conglomerates becoming more cautious about foreign acquisitions and some firms have even divested some interests that they acquired abroad right now there are controlled capital outflows between us 30 50 billion per month which can still be financed said cliff tan east asian head of global markets research at mufg what would be a problem is if we started seeing a doubling of that if it gets bigger that is probably through illegal means such as moving assets out to buy foreign investment products in hong kong

for many years our investments land division formerly novus realty advisors now a division of younger partners has produced a report to assist investors in deciding the viability of acquiring undeveloped land for mid range and long term positive returns since our 2017 report was distributed dfw has experienced continued active growth in virtually every commercial and residential product type as the accompanying exhibits indicate transaction volume held steady for both user and investment product much remains the same in our report this year except we are seeing legitimate evolving trends that should be acknowledged absorption of developed undeveloped land with limited or no access to infrastructure permitting immediate use and underutilized land activity traded at a comparable rate to 2017 the trend continues as aggressive new vertical development has left even fewer desirable infill sites remaining available more peripheral sites are seeing increasing activity with employers competing for employees desiring a shorter commuting distance this competition for employees inflated raw land and construction costs a rapidly increasing cost of living and transportation congestion are all beginning to affect our extended growth cycle however we remain attractive to geographical relocations when compared to our competition with the anticipated continued job growth inbound population increases relatively low interest rates and a sound local economy there is no reason for an immediate corrective cycle should any one of those benchmarks collapse or even display a solid weakness a correction is imminent although we have retained historically low capitalization rates despite sale prices at a multiple of replacement cost and static retail demand income producing investments have maintained their active volume largely due to the need to invest 1031 trade equity and the lack of competition with alternative investments excessive competition to acquire cash flow assets providing even the smallest yields produces increased vulnerability to market corrections a cyclical downturn in the national economy would have a dour negative impact and threaten positive cash flows inherently land investment differs greatly from other types of real estate products generally because of its inability to produce interim cash flow and its considerably more sensitive vulnerability to recurring cycles the criteria used to determine potential land opportunities while becoming more sophisticated over the last two cycles remains principally in implementing basic strategies perhaps the most important of these is the ability to project and fund ownership long term positive liquidity the allowed ability to sell for an acceptable profit at the optimum market time can be highly speculative when an investor is in a forced sale position or loses confidence in the future of the investment returns are jeopardized and most frequently result in a significant loss sorting through the noise with the proliferation of online data should investors search hard enough they can find support for any speculative investment philosophy positive or negative to justify an action this presentation qualifies as but one of many however certain facts remain more pertinent than most as they may apply to investments in unimproved or underutilized land assets in dfw again referring to the accompanying charts a conservative estimate of pending 10 year population growth for dfw is 1 million plus new residents climate central location progressive state and local government and no personal or corporate income tax would support this projection possessing no true natural barriers for continued land absorption there appears to be no single real estate oriented obstacle to limit this projection population growth can be fueled both organically and by external inbound relocations with trailing 12 month growth of 120 000 jobs the majority of the population increase stems from such relocations it is estimated that only eighty percent of the jobs created by recent moves into dfw have been filled in the last six years over thirty five thousand acres of land have traded with an additional large number not being included when classified as long term investment land like most types of investments real estate is cyclical investment success or failure can often solely depend on where the cycle is at the time the purchase is made in conjunction with the investor s ability to determine the true state of the cycle buying at various points in a cycle cost averaging can provide some security allowing for both buying selling to generate positive results there has yet to be a final cycle the ability to hold long term may negatively impact the final yield but does offer security while the ability to use historical data to project long term value is logical many down cycles have been created by artificial non real estate related influences that were difficult to anticipate for example in the late 1980s tax law changes and deregulation destroyed the market in the late 2000s the subprime collapse did the same it is reasonable to assume there will be more fragile bubbles included in our report is our land absorption map click on the map for a larger view which sets out various types of 2018 commercial real estate activity in specific geographic areas actual sales current listings and announcements of pending projects are the basic criteria used and have been benchmarked annually to complete the current year s map not difficult to understand the progression from active to long term generally follows the current availability of infrastructure and newer expanding city services land currently available for vertical construction will bring significantly higher values and greater activity over those that must physically wait for services over the 20 plus years of presenting the map it is interesting to note that while the circles have limited movement the colors have many changes and generally move out from the core in concentric circles an ever increasing burden to investors and developers is the dramatic involvement of politically motivated impractical restrictions imposed on reasonable growth by many local municipalities frequently viable beneficial projects are excluded from fruition by flawed unrelated personal or political interests younger partners is a member of the highly respected north texas land council ntlc a group comprised of 50 of the most active and talented land brokers in our area believing that activity generates more activity the north texas land council freely shares information with its competing members and the market in general on a level of professionalism unusual within similar organizations and as such is a benefit to all clients much of the projected activity displayed on the younger land absorption map ylam reflects the activities of the ntlc pricing levels may have achieved their pinnacle the market today continues to see record prices for infill readily developable sites possessing available infrastructure permitted anticipated uses and demand for completed product however distinct indications of this aggressive approach are beginning to surface perhaps harboring at a minimum at least a cooling off period or perhaps the correction we have anticipated the last few years as it relates to land pricing levels may have achieved their pinnacle for this long evolving cycle for many increased cost factors single family new home prices have increased 50 percent in five years making affordability more difficult less obvious are completed per square foot costs in all commercial sectors the strong local and national economies along with continued relocations have provided record employment and income that momentum will carry through at least the first half of 2019 past that projections are difficult dfw is well positioned to absorb a moderate abated market land prices however must readjust for the return of an active market again as last year the pipeline for new projects of all types has gotten understandably smaller which presents an interesting speculative projection for 2020 and beyond increased activity for pure longer term investment sites has continued the extension to the outer lying concentric circle tracts considered pure investment tracts until 2016 such tracts remained fairly benign in sales activity and price fluctuation these specific investments are becoming more attractive since competing investments such as oil and gas price fluctuation and over production a pending bear stock and bond market the same non occurring pending from last year and the tech world which offer much higher risk vehicles additionally local investors the heretofore most active group of land speculators are seeing increased competition from more patient national and foreign investors yet historically and perhaps ironically a large number of the most successful wealthiest investors have made their patient fortunes in land by simply applying these basic techniques our continuing and extended analysis as displayed on the land absorption map revised november 2018 is principally based on extensive historical data utilizing market experience possessed by younger associates members of the ntlc and reliable future projections from sources that have traditionally displayed accurate demographic information our attached graphs were created by steve triolet younger s director of research depending on which source one chooses to use the dfw market still expects to absorb an additional population expansion of 25 percent to 30 percent over the next 15 years success in real estate investment will be to determine where that growth will locate history has taught us that product will be made available and priced based on pure economics the cost to provide available product to meet demand will depend on the availability of affordable infrastructure sewer water roads proximity to employment centers service commercial schools political climate etc land prices will fluctuate according to such availability absorption the national economy and the popularity of any specific product investing in the right opportunities will generate exceptional rewards some estimate that it requires approximately 12 000 acres to 15 000 acres of raw land to accommodate one million people in a reasonably confined socially acceptable service provided environment dfw enjoyed record rainfall in 2018 keeping our resources at sustainable levels given the droughts of previous years with the population growth that has occurred a dry year will present some worrisome challenges only new sources can cure a partial answer lies in the creation of two new reservoirs in east texas probably 10 years from service lack of both potable and irrigation water access will be an inevitable liability we have been fortunate to have had an extended period of prodigious activity which can at least be partially credited to our aggressive political structure both local and state our sophisticated and informed developers and engineers and our incredibly competent and equally aggressive local and regional economic development corporations of equal depth however is the dynamic well educated hard working and professional under 40 group of brokers administrators managers and general employment base who have emerged during this cycle they may well be the first group exiting a positive cycle who have learned and benefited from the experience of their predecessors they may not need a disaster to stay relevant and solvent in conclusion the principles of successful sophisticated investment must utilize basic criteria some of which are outlined above access to infrastructure most importantly water the admirable continued effort by our current dallas mayor to utilize available land in our southern corridor

asian markets turned south thursday as investors took a breather after rallying this week on optimism over china us trade talks and the federal reserve s softer tone on interest rates there was also growing unease over the us government shutdown which is now in its third week after president donald trump walked out of a meeting with democrats to resolve the issue meaning it will likely drag on for some time to come tokyo led the losses with exporters hit by a rising yen against the dollar after minutes from the fed s latest policy meeting showed the policy board happy to slow its pace of rate hikes to prevent a slowdown in the economy central bankers said they can afford to be patient owing to low inflation and uncertainty about the outlook and while there would likely be more increases in borrowing costs it would be a relatively limited amount the minutes reinforced comments from fed boss jerome powell last week that there was no pre set plan on rates which fanned a global market rally fears about rising costs were a key factor in driving equities lower last year they also fuelled a dollar sell off with the greenback weakening across the board and the chinese yuan at its highest level since late august while the dollar stabilised against its major peers thursday it saw more losses against higher yielding currencies with the new found optimism providing a boost to riskier assets i m happy to see that there was caution in the minutes alicia levine chief strategist at bny mellon investment management told bloomberg tv you want it to be that this is what the fed policy board really believes that caution is warranted that they re going to be data dependent and there are alternative outcomes that they should be aware of i take great comfort in these minutes total waste of time in early trade hong kong was down 0 3 after rising around 5 over the previous four days while shanghai was 0 1 off sydney was also barely moved while singapore shed 0 2 and seoul eased 0 1 despite the losses there is a much happier mood on trading floors helped by hopes of a breakthrough in the tariffs spat between the world s top two economies after three days of talks in beijing chinese officials said negotiators had laid the groundwork to resolve their differences trump earlier this week tweeted his optimism a deal could be struck at some point this outcome is very much in line with broader expectations given this was a preliminary mid level us and chinese trade representatives affair possibly setting up for a more significant announcement in davos when president trump takes the grand stage said stephen innes head of asia pacific trade at oanda oil prices were also lower thursday having surged around 5 wednesday in response to confirmation from saudi arabia that it would slash exports of the black gold after an agreement between opec and other top producers such as russia late last year both main contracts have rallied by more than a fifth since late december before which they had dived more than 40 since october on supply and demand worries confidence in reduced saudi russia and other opec member shipments the positive trade vibes and a weaker us dollar are all contributing to the rebound said national australia bank strategist ray attrill dealers are keeping tabs on developments in washington after talks to end the us government shutdown broke down when trump stormed out after democrats told him they would not fund his mexican border wall he later described the talks with congressional leaders as a total waste of time meaning several parts of the government remain unfunded with hundreds of thousands of workers at home unpaid and no sign of an end to the impasse

gov elect j b pritzker takes office next week on the heels of the most decisive election victory in a generation and he ll be working to pass his agenda through the biggest democratic majorities in the general assembly since the 1960s that raises a question what precisely does that agenda consist of brian mackey discusses the pritzker agenda with host sean crawford watching campaign ads on tv one could get the impression he promised little more than fighting for the state of illinois and similar pap but more substantive proposals are out there early in his tenure gov bruce rauner produced the turnaround agenda it included 44 bullet points of things he wanted to get done but some of that was not what rauner emphasized in his campaign particularly his drive to weaken labor unions and their allies in the democratic party so we though it d be useful to enumerate the pritzker agenda at least as it existed when he was trying to convince illinoisans to elect him we pulled the following list from primary and general election debates speeches and news conferences before and after the election and 21 separate j b on the issues pages from pritzker s campaign website taken together those pages comprise more than 19 000 words much of that consists of principles and priorities vague ideas rather than specific initiatives but to observers who judged him primarily on the platitudes heard in ads and debates there is a surprising amount of detail this list will focus on the concrete proposals things that can be enacted through legislation or through the executive branch of government and may be more representative than comprehensive the campaign cautions that these are priorities and principles not demands that s in contrast with how rauner asked legislators to approach his turnaround agenda in 2015 we should consider it as a whole not as a list of individual initiatives whether in five months after pritzker s first legislative session or in four years should he choose to run for reelection this checklist can be used to judge pritzker s progress toward enacting his agenda and that of his opponents in trying to block him pritzker made several promises in the area of health care including the creation of a state public health insurance option the plan called illinoiscares would let people buy into the state s medicaid program his campaign says based on current medicaid spending figures that annual cost would be in the range of 3 350 per adult and 2 108 per child because people would have to buy in he says the plan would have no cost to taxpayers by my informal and likely erroneous tally pritzker s campaign pronouncements included the word jobs in every other sentence never mind that economists say governors don t have much influence on job creation this is what modern politicians are compelled to say pritzker says he would raise the illinois minimum wage to 15 an hour pass a big infrastructure spending bill money used to build and repair highways bridges ports public transpiration and government buildings make high speed internet access available everywhere in illinois upgrading the locks and dams on the mississippi and illinois rivers update lead pipes in water systems make microloans more widely available pass a truth in lending act aimed at protecting small business owners increase funding for small business development centers review the enterprise zone program to make sure the state is stimulating growth in the most economically distressed communities promote wind and solar power while also supporting the advanced coal and energy research center at southern illinois university carbondale he s also pledged to set illinois on a path toward 100 clean renewable energy make more money available to farms for investment in technology force net neutrality on internet service providers that have state contracts pursue legislation that prevents employers from asking about salary history support construction of a third chicago airport near peotone in the far south suburbs on the condition it doesn t take jobs away from o hare or midway airports pritzker outlined a number of policies intended to increase business opportunities for women and people of color increase the aspirational goal for the share of state contracts going to women and minority owners businesses to 30 percent create a cabinet level position to make sure that aspiration becomes a reality have a loan program that helps minority business owners compete for state contracts start minority and women owned business accelerators to provide mentoring financing and other help fund pre apprenticeship programs to help people from disadvantaged communities get jobs in the building trades both union and non union expand employment programs for disadvantaged youth help unbanked communities by encouraging financial institutions to provide services in libraries and other public spaces cap rates for check cashing broadly speaking pritzker says he wants to put the state back on firm financial footing to that end he says he would support a graduated or progressive income tax where higher amounts of income are subject to higher tax rates such a change would have to be passed by the legislature and ratified by voters at a general election add progressively to the flat tax while waiting for the progressive tax by increasing the earned income tax credit and raising the overall tax rate that was during the campaign after winning he backed off from this proposal not in favor of increases in the gas tax expanding the sales tax to cover services or ending the tax exemption for so called retirement income all three topics were presented at debates those who supported the ideas were asked to raise their hands pritzker kept his down every time support fair maps to stop legislators from gerrymandering their own district boundaries support term limits for leadership roles in the general assembly though not for legislators in general change annual state pension payments so they re level every year putting more money in up front rather than trying to cut benefits thus fulfilling what he calls both a moral and legal obligation to workers and retirees lower property taxes especially on lower income households as part of shifting the main funding burden for education from local government onto the state oppose the private school tax credit program or anything else that s siphoning off money from public schools lowering the mandatory school enrollment age from 6 to 5 incrementally enroll more 3 and 4 year olds in preschool about 12 500 a year for eight years increase access to state child care subsidies to 200 percent of the federal poverty level from the current 185 percent and let people gradually wind down participation as their income approaches 300 percent of the poverty level the campaign says 200 percent threshold would be about 40 000 in annual salary for a family of three add more preschool teachers and classrooms i m going to establish new financial incentives for people to earn the appropriate credentials and enter the state s early learning workforce expand birth to three home visit services and create a family engagement portal to educate new parents on child development create a single shared application for every state university in illinois increase financial aid for low income college students known as monetary award program or map grants by 50 percent create a state run program to help people refinance student loan debt restore funding for state universities and

article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com after months of prolonged and often heated negotiations canada the united states and mexico unveiled at the end of september a new trilateral trade deal that will replace the north american free trade agreement nafta the united states mexico canada agreement usmca brings resolution to some of the sticking points that prevented an earlier agreement our colleagues have highlighted some key provisions of the usmca in a previous article this article addresses the elimination of the chapter 11 investor state dispute settlement mechanism as between canada and the united states investor state dispute settlement under nafta among the most controversial elements of nafta chapter 11 which contains obligations with respect to the treatment of the other parties investors and their investments enables those investors to bring claims against a host party for breach of those obligations under a mechanism known as investor state dispute settlement isds isds which is available under many bilateral investment treaties and some other free trade agreements is intended among other things to encourage foreign investment by allowing investors to seek damages through binding arbitration for a host state s failure to abide by its treaty commitments including commitments to treat them fairly not to discriminate against investors or their investments and not to expropriate investments or take measures amounting to expropriation without paying adequate compensation how canada has fared the inclusion of chapter 11 in nafta was the first time that isds was incorporated into a free trade agreement chapter 11 was introduced mainly to protect canadian and american investors seeking to invest in mexico during the history of nafta however canada has been the subject of most of the investor claims under chapter 11 the united states on the other hand has never lost a case and never paid a dollar in damages nafta negotiations the trump administration was a vocal opponent of the nafta dispute settlement mechanisms during the negotiations the united states trade representative robert lighthizer explained the united states opposition of chapter 11 in part on the basis that it promoted outsourcing of jobs and investments although american investors have reaped benefits under chapter 11 there is no guarantee that the government will continue its winning streak in the investor claims although the united states did not oppose the state to state dispute settlement provisions found in chapter 20 of nafta it sought to dilute these provisions considerably the united states also sought successfully but somewhat contradictorily to make the labour and environmental obligations in the agreement subject to state to state dispute settlement the opposition to chapter 11 and the other dispute resolution measures appeared in line with the current american protectionist trade policies and general antipathy towards being subjected to any form of binding international dispute settlement foreign affairs minister chrystia freeland canada s lead representative in the negotiations has expressed skepticism about the value of isds reforms to the isds process were listed among canada s negotiation objectives such that governments have an unassailable right to regulate in the public interest during the lengthy negotiations process mexico stood with canada in pushing the united states to decide whether it wanted to commit to isds indicating a willingness to proceed with a bilaterally agreed isds mechanism if necessary of the proposals put forth by canada and mexico mexico s proposal was closer to the existing isds framework under nafta while canada s proposal was modelled after the isds mechanism in its comprehensive economic and trade agreement with the european union isds under the usmca investment obligations and isds will be governed in the usmca by chapter 14 the usmca entirely eliminates isds with respect to canada american and mexican investors will no longer be able to bring investor claims against the canadian government and canadian investors will no longer be able to bring investor claims against the government of either of the other trading partners canada and the united states have agreed to a three year phase out for claims in respect of investments made while nafta has been in force investors can bring their claims for three years after the usmca comes into force after which investors protection will be limited to only causes of action available in domestic law if any such as indirect expropriation for investor state disputes between canada and mexico investors will have recourse through the traditional nafta like isds mechanism in the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership after it enters into force on december 30 2018 as between the united states and mexico traditional isds is preserved but with considerable restrictions relative to nafta particularly if the claim does not arise out of an investment contract with the host state to either provide public services in certain covered sectors power generation telecommunications transportation and infrastructure or to engage in activities controlled by the host state in the oil and gas sector for investors in other sectors chapter 14 further curtails isds by limiting the types of claims that these investors may bring allowing only for claims of alleged post establishment breaches of the non discrimination obligations national treatment and most favoured nation treatment and for claims of direct expropriation also precluded from making chapter 14 claims are those investors owned or controlled by a non us or mexican persons from what the host state considers to be a non market economy e g china potential implications for the oil and gas industry for investors in the oil and gas industry or other sectors that may have been affected by the government action of a host state investor claims under nafta may be an available remedy investors with potential isds challenges should bring their claims prior to the earlier noted three year expiry period investor claims have been used in the oil and gas industry consider for example the 15 billion nafta investor claim initiated by transcanada corporation in 2016 after former president barack obama rejected its application for a presidential permit to approve the construction of keystone xl in the united states transcanada argued that the rejection was politically motivated and in breach of the united states nafta commitment to protect canadian investments with respect to national treatment most favoured nation treatment minimum standard of treatment and expropriation transcanada s claim was withdrawn after president trump reversed the decision and issued a presidential permit authorizing the construction of the project in 2015 exxonmobil and murphy oil successfully claimed for damages against the government of canada on the basis that requirements imposed by canada and newfoundland and labrador for the companies to pay a percentage of their offshore revenues into research and training in newfoundland constituted performance requirements contrary to nafta more recently lone pine resources has brought a 250 million nafta claim against the government of canada after quebec introduced a moratorium on fracking under the st lawrence river investors from other natural resource sectors have also brought claims under chapter 11 for example in 2011 american forestry company abitibibowater inc now resolute forest products obtained a 130 million settlement against canada for newfoundland and labrador s expropriation of its water and timber rights and hydroelectric generation facilities with respect to the energy sector in 2016 u s based windstream energy was awarded more than 25 million in compensation because ontario issued a moratorium on offshore wind development after windstream had secured a contract with the province under its feed in tariff program recently u s based westmoreland coal company which has several coal mines in canada has indicated its intention to pursue remedies against the government of canada related to chapter 11 of nafta for us 380 million over alleged discrimination related to the government of alberta s climate leadership plan strategy to phase out coal fired electricity generation pollution by 2030 given the elimination of isds between canada and the united states investors may find protection only through causes of action that are available in the domestic law of the host state in this article we wrote about canada s recognition of the common law cause of action for de facto or disguised expropriation one of the potential domestic claims that investors may seek against the government of canada this common law cause of action will remain available as a form of recourse through local courts and has been used previously to compensate interest holders for the effective taking away of those interests by government actions it is available to both domestic parties and foreign investors for instance it is being used by lgx oil gas inc lgx regarding the government of canada s emergency order issued to protect the greater sage grouse habitat in southern alberta and saskatchewan which lgx claims has inhibited its operations to such an extent that its oil and gas interests were effectively taken as there continues to be contemplation of a

america s new africa strategy recently the white house released its new u s africa strategy which seeks militarization and portrays china as a threat both are misguided africa can greatly benefit from chinese and u s economic development on december 13 2018 u s national security adviser john bolton gave a speech in the conservative heritage foundation about the trump administration s new africa strategy based on trump s america first foreign policy doctrine in the united states the media focus was on bolton s attack against u s adversaries and american aid specifically boston accused russia and china of predatory practices in africa in practice the trump administration s africa strategy implies militarization of u s activities in africa to undermine chinese economic contribution which has effectively supported modernization and growth in the continent militarization of u s africa strategy in 2017 the united states had a 39 0 billion in total goods trade with sub saharan african countries and a trade deficit of 10 8 billion america s largest export markets were south africa nigeria ghana ethiopia and angola in imports cote d ivoire and botswana played a role as well in the past u s africa strategy focused mainly on economic cooperation and aid and secondarily on military cooperation in the new strategy the focus areas have been reversed the america first africa strategy purports to address three core u s interests in africa first advancing u s trade and commercial ties with nations across the region to the benefit of both the united states and africa second countering the threat from radical islamic terrorism and violent conflict and third we will ensure that u s taxpayer dollars for aid are used efficiently and effectively while the first core interest ostensibly involves economic dealings it actually doesn t the trump administration wants our economic partners in the region to thrive but it downplays all economic efforts to boost african prosperity it is the second principle that s the key to the new u s strategy according to bolton isis al qaida and their affiliates all operate and recruit on the african continent plotting attacks against american citizens and targets the new strategy sees africa mainly as a base of islamic terrorism which must be defused in the continent so that it will not threaten american interests third the new strategy will no longer support unproductive unsuccessful and unaccountable u n peacekeeping missions moreover the america first stance portrays as adversarial the chinese efforts to boost global economic integration through the one road and belt initiative in emerging and developing economies china s economic contribution is mainly an effort to dominate the world as bolton puts it predatory actions are sub components of broader chinese strategic initiatives including one belt one road a plan to develop a series of trade routes leading to and from china with the ultimate goal of advancing chinese global dominance since economic facts do not support the trump administration s narrative it relies increasingly on ideological trashing chinese economic cooperation in africa since the mid 2010s washington has accused china of neocolonialism in africa the misguided narrative seeks to reframe the eclipse of the commodity super cycle which caused a drastic fall in commodity prices as another chinese plot in 2016 the value of china africa trade was 128 billion almost three times bigger than u s trade with the continent the largest african exporters to china comprise angola south africa and the republic of congo whereas the largest buyers of chinese goods include south africa and nigeria the sino african trade increased rapidly some two decades until the fall of the commodity prices since 2014 when the bilateral trade peaked at 215 billion since then the value of african exports to china has been penalized even as chinese exports to africa have remained steady meanwhile u s investment in china has collapsed u s fdi into africa grew through the bush years when the white house still hoped to benefit from the impending industrialization in several african economies but as the obama administration presented its africa vision in the early 2010s u s fdi first plunged and then collapsed figure figure chinese fdi and us fdi to africa flows 2003 2015 source unctad china statistical yearbook difference group when the administration began its attack against chinese initiatives last fall these outbursts were preceded by president xi jinping s speech in the 2018 forum on china africa cooperation focac where xi pledged 60 billion to the continent in loans grants and development financing the new u s africa strategy is largely dictated by the concern that a has become africa s largest economic partner in contrast to bolton s fearful images of chinese negative impact in africa leading business consultancies including mckinsey offer very different accounts the former is based on ideological bashing without facts the latter reflects simple economic analysis bolton on the u s africa strategy mckinsey on china in africa china uses bribes opaque agreements and the strategic use of debt to hold states in africa captive to beijing s wishes and demands its investment ventures are riddled with corruption and do not meet the same environmental or ethical standards as u s developmental programs the chinese dragons firms of all sizes and sectors are bringing capital investment management know how and entrepreneurial energy to every corner of the continent and in so doing they are helping to accelerate the progress of africa s lions as its economies are often referred to in the past two decades africa china trade has been growing at some 20 per year fdi has grown twice as fast in the past decade mckinsey estimates china s financial flows to africa are 15 higher than official figures when non traditional flows are included china is also a large and fast growing source of aid and the largest source of construction financing which support africa s ambitious infrastructure developments but is chinese infrastructure investment in africa a threat to u s interests really u s china and africa two scenarios ever since the release of the u s administration s new 2017 national security strategy china has been perceived as america s adversary rather than a partner for decades u s policy was rooted in the belief that support for china s rise and for its integration into the post war international order would liberalize china the new africa strategy is actually based on the old neoconservative wolfowitz doctrine which in the early 90s deems that the american goal must be to prevent the re emergence of a new rival either on the territory of the former soviet union or elsewhere that poses a threat that s why the white house sees its china ties mainly in win lose terms but there is another future scenario that sees the multipolar world economy as a strength rather than a liability it is predicated on more stable global prospects as developing economies focus on economic development instead of militarization unlike the u s africa strategy the multipolar scenario would not foster major power competition in africa rather it supports a win win scenario in which both america and china would trade and invest and provide development aid to african economies that would accelerate modernization and industrialization across the continent and thus living standards with rising prosperity terror would diminish the multipolar scenario would fulfill the three u s core interests in africa and foster triangular economic ties among the u s china and africa while intensifying modernization in the continent in contrast the old new u s africa

spread the love against the backdrop of civil servants in zimbabwe threatening to go on a full scale strike the hard truth is that the country s government just cannot afford to pay salaries in us dollars as they are demanding by james thompson but workers do not believe it when faced with pressing demands from striking doctors vice president constantino chiwenga largely viewed as a hardliner in government told journalists bluntly government does not print us dollars now the chorus has grown all government workers are demanding a review of their salaries by the end of january but still the government is maintaining that it is incapacitated in discussion with workers government explained that it cannot go back to paying workers in usd as in 2009 this is because the 2009 total wage bill was around 30m per month now it s 300m per month monthly exports are around the same figure making usd payment impossible said the country s ministry of information publicity and broadcasting for the ordinary man on the street however the rationale given by government does not make sense this is a political statement meant to discourage us it s in the same vein as the billion dollar mega deals we were told about during the run up to the presidential elections where are they it s hot air said a mathematics teacher who preferred not to be named when dollarisation started we were all paid a flat fee of 100 from there on the money was increased government should tell us how and why within nine years the wage bill has gone up tenfold he added economist john robertson said zimbabwe s government is not bold enough to come clean at once although it s clear that the money is not there and there is no foreign direct investment fdi coming in the money is not there said robertson the primary base of the state s taxes are in bond notes what is merely happening is that real time gross settlement rtgs systems is what reflects in workers bank accounts on pay day but there is no actual money to back it up we have a bad reputation out there even borrowing is out of the picture it s a tough road ahead he added while the majority of zimbabweans suffer the economic meltdown has opened a window of opportunity for those working in the diaspora and basically anyone with access to foreign currency although the government insists that the bond note is trading at par with the american dollar on the streets 100 is equivalent to 350 in bond notes as of monday morning as such those wishing to pay off bills are having a field day i bought a house via mortgage five years ago and i am left with something like 25 000 to finish that amount today is an equivalent of 7 000 so i am trading hard currency on the streets to pay it off it s a bargain said admire tshuma who works for a gold mine in matabeleland south real estate companies are now moving towards charging new clients in hard currency a cellphone dealer in bulawayo said my lease expires next month and already i was told that i can only renew it if i commit to paying the same amount i was paying in hard currency that s a total rip off at least if they were to reduce it and peg it to the prevailing black market rate i would understand but their argument is that officially the bond and us dollar are at par yet they don t want to see the bond note local authorities have also started dangling forex incentives the bulawayo city council started implementing a 50 debt cancellation policy for those paying their bills in foreign currency while all international organisations operating in the city are now required to pay for services in forex timeslive share this share twitter facebook email linkedin reddit pinterest whatsapp like this like loading
